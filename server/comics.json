A tireless tactician and expert political operator, she quickly moved up into the highest levels of government and put together a new version of an old black-ops team called Task Force X. Recruiting incarcerated super-villains, her Suicide Squad does the dirty work that heroes like the Justice League can’t or won’t.

But when she was just an infant, her House fell into chaos following the uprising of the House of Opal and its ruthless ruler, Dark Opal. Thankfully, a witch named Citrina managed to save Amethyst before Dark Opal could assassinate her, sending her to Earth to live with a human family under the assumed name of Amy Winston. When Amy turned 13, however, Dark Opal tracked down her human family and attacked, forcing Amy to learn the truth of her heritage. Amy subsequently returned to Gemworld, where she learned she’d inherited magical abilities and of the duties that fell to her in the wake of her family’s destruction.

      "biography": "Many teens undergo an anti-establishment phase. They fight against authority, rejecting the government and any type of oversight. They demand equality and oppose corruption. Sometimes though, it's more than just standing against the establishment. Sometimes, in order to combat corruption, it’s better to abolish the establishment completely and let anarchy reign.Highly intelligent and deeply philosophical, Lonnie Machin developed a strong ethical and apolitical code. Looking at the world around him, he saw corruption, social oppression and the suffering of everyday people—and saw the government doing nothing about it. Taking a cue from the Dark Knight, Machin studied martial arts and put his engineering abilities and knowledge of computer technology to use to become a vigilante himself: Anarky. Although he thinks of himself as a hero like Batman and believes anarchy would help the people help themselves, Batman views Anarky's methods and actions as childish and violent, and considers Anarky a public threat, plain and simple.Anarky uses his abilities to bring down any corporation or authoritative entity that he feels hurts and oppresses people. While he can throw a punch as well as anyone, he relies primarily on his thorough understanding of modern technology to defeat his foes along with the very essence of anarchy itself—surprise.",

Barda relished fighting and enjoyed besting anyone that challenged her. Her sheer power and unparalleled skills in combat quickly made her the most feared Apokoliptian warrior of all time—an incredible feat to accomplish on a world that bred the most terrifying, cruel and malicious fighters in the Multiverse.

Usually wanting nothing more than to be seen as the hero that his famous counterpart Superman is, he has often developed a strong hatred for his \"perfect\" brother. Sometimes misguided, sometimes genuinely malevolent, and even sometimes a true hero himself, Bizarro is nevertheless a force to be reckoned with.For more on Bizarro's history, visit his page on DCUniverse.com.",

In his quest for ultimate power, the immortal Darkseid has repeatedly come into conflict with Apokolips’ sister world, the heavenly New Genesis, along with heroes like Superman and the Justice League.Ruling over a court of equally twisted and sadistic individuals and commanding an army of mindless Parademons who obey his every whim, Darkseid can be defeated, but never truly destroyed. As long as malice and despair exist, the God of Evil will always find a way to return and attempt to spread his tyrannical rule over all who live. On Apokolips, there’s only one key thing every subject must understand about their ruler—Darkseid IS. There is nothing else.For more on Darkseid's history, visit his page on DCUniverse.com.",

But in death, he became one of its greatest heroes. Brand performed as a trapeze artist using the stage name \"Deadman\" due to his death-defying acts, ghostly white face paint and flamboyant costume. But during one of his performances, he was murdered in midair by a mysterious assassin known only as \"The Hook.\" When he died, his spirit was granted the power to possess any living being by the Hindu god Rama Kushna, so that Boston could search for his killer and receive a measure of peace. Now a literal Deadman, he was both a ghost and a DC superhero.Although Deadman would eventually catch his murderer, who'd killed him as part of an elaborate initiation ritual to join an elite group of assassins, he continued to use his abilities to help people in the mortal world. While the majority of Earth's heroes don't know about Brand's existence as Deadman, there are a select few who do. He's worked several times with Batman, as well as more supernaturally inclined heroes like the Spectre and the Sentinels of Magic. In more recent years, he's served as a member of the Justice League Dark.

The experience awakened in Cizko latent powers of illusion and hypnosis.

He possessed powers not only of telepathy, but mind control, telekinesis, astral projection and psi energy (or ectokinesis) that he could use to create and animate constructs. Unfortunately, Cizko was a sadist who hated women and enjoyed terrifying and torturing people to further his research into the human mind…and sometimes simply for enjoyment. More than once, he’s helped other villains attack or manipulate Earth’s heroes.

In the case of the Hierarchy of International Vengeance and Extermination, or H.I.V.E., as it’s more commonly known, the goal is simple: to bring together scientists and trained forces for the sole purpose of eliminating every super hero from the face of the planet.Although there have been several incarnations of H.I.V.E. throughout the years, each founded by various members of the super-villain community—including Damien Darhk, Queen Bee and Adeline Kane—its main mission statement has remained the same. Sometimes the organization pushes its own agenda; other times, it offers its services to anyone willing to pay the right price.H.I.V.E. consists of many skilled members, from scientists to trained assassins. Although willing to go after any super heroes, H.I.V.E. often finds itself at odds with the Teen Titans, and as such,&nbsp;has regularly worked alongside the team's greatest adversary, Slade Wilson, aka Deathstroke.",

In truth, Lyla was saved moments before her demise by a powerful being known as the Monitor. Locked in eternal struggle for the fate of reality with his antimatter counterpart, the Anti-Monitor, the Monitor had chosen Lyla to act as his personal agent in observing, testing and preparing the world’s greatest heroes and villains for the day their battle spilled over into their universe. To accomplish this important task, the Monitor granted Lyla the powers of strength, flight, regeneration and, most importantly, duplication, allowing her to occupy multiple points at once in order to better prepare the earth for combat in the limited time before the Crisis on Infinite Earths and announce the event’s coming. In this capacity, Lyla Michaels assumed the identity of the Harbinger for her grave but essential duty to announce the doom of the world should its defenders fail to defeat the Anti-Monitor.But unwittingly, Harbinger proved just as effective as an agent of the Anti-Monitor himself. When the Crisis arrived, the Anti-Monitor managed to corrupt Harbinger, leading her to betray the Monitor and bring about his death by her own hands. Mad with grief over what she had done, Harbinger shook free of the Anti-Monitor’s influence and used the last of her powers to save the doomed worlds of Earth-4, Earth-S and Earth-X, allowing its heroes to merge into the New Earth which arose at the end of the Crisis.For more on Harbinger's history, visit her page on DCUniverse.com.",

A promising psychologist and intern at Arkham Asylum in Gotham City, Harleen was given the chance to get up close and personal with the Joker, an experience that wound up ending…badly. Harleen became obsessed with her subject, and after falling madly in love with the Clown Prince of Crime, she helped him escape the asylum.Her love for the Joker inspired Harleen to adopt a new identity, that of Harley Quinn, The Joker’s sidekick-slash-love interest—whether he wanted one or not. (Most of the time? He did not.)In time, Harley came to realize the Joker was holding her back, and she struck out on her own. She became an entrepreneur and a member of several slightly less-than-reputable super teams (including the Suicide Squad), Gotham City’s all-girl gang (the Gotham City Sirens) and a traveling sideshow. Along the way Harley has become one of the most popular super-villains in the DC Universe, thanks in part to her versatility, charisma and cheery-but-deranged outlook on life.After all, as Harley would say, if you're going to go a little crazy, you may as well sit back and enjoy the ride!For more on Harley Quinn's history, visit her page on DCUniverse.com.",

Over time, Hank accepted Dawn as a fitting successor to his brother.Dawn’s level head, along with her willingness to see reason and compromise, make her the perfect counterpoint to Hank’s hair-trigger rage and stubbornness.

      "biography": "After fusing with the ice emitted from a thermodynamic ultraconductor engine, Caitlin Snow gained the ability to project various forms of frozen water—including ice and snow—from the tips of her fingers.\n\nOne of the chilliest characters in the DC Universe, Killer Frost has been a villain, an antihero and a hero. First introduced as Crystal Frost, a former student of Professor Martin Stein, she was an adversary for Firestorm until her death. Shortly thereafter, her friend Dr. Louise Lincoln replicated the experiment that gave Crystal her powers and became the second Killer Frost. With a vendetta against Firestorm, she would fight the nuclear hero for years, on her own and as a member of the Suicide Squad and Injustice League.\n\nThe third and current Killer Frost is Dr. Caitlin Snow, a scientist at S.T.A.R. Labs. When Snow was attacked by agents of H.I.V.E. in the Arctic, she gained cold powers and used them to help Martin Stein and Steve Trevor rescue the Justice League. Since then, Snow has found herself on both the Suicide Squad and the Justice League of America, and demonstrated a desire and willingness to be more than the villainous legacy she’s inherited.\n\nFor more on Killer Frost's history, visit her page on DCUniverse.com.",

From a young age, Lex utilized his almost unparalleled acumen to build himself a financial empire through hard work and dedication—but mainly through the strategic use of intimidation, bribery and murder. Sacrificing other people became simply a means to an end on the path to success, but Luthor always made sure none of his deplorable acts could be traced back to him. Instead, his climb to power and rise in status made him someone to look up to, someone people wanted to emulate—and he relished in the adoration.Until it all changed the day Superman appeared and gave the world something else to aspire to.Driven by jealousy masked with hate over what he perceives to be his stolen place as humanity's true savior, Luthor constantly attempts to destroy and humiliate Superman at every possible opportunity. He's willing to lie, cheat, steal, manipulate and go to any extreme necessary to accomplish his goals, not caring one bit about who he hurts. He is a man who not only wants to be seen as a god, but who has convinced himself he's the only one this worlds needs.",

Unfortunately for them, the foul-mouth brawler’s idea of a perfect world is one covered in bruises and blood. He wiped out his entire civilization and made himself the last of his people. Considering his name means \"he who devours your entrails and thoroughly enjoys it\" in his native tongue, perhaps they shouldn’t have been too surprised. Lobo took his predilection for murder and mayhem along with his rocket-fueled motorcycle and went on to become the best bounty hunter in the galaxy.Lobo looks out for himself first and foremost, and is never without a plan to cash in at other people’s expense. Though he’s glad to use weapons, Lobo doesn't really need them. His super-strength means his fists are made for bashing. Couple that with his advanced healing powers and unquenchable thirst for blood, and he’s proven to be an incredibly difficult foe to stop—unless you can trick him into entering into a deal. Mercenary or not, Lobo always keeps his word…though he’s not above getting creative in his interpretation of “true to his promise.” As an intergalactic bounty hunter, Lobo's gigs take him all over the universe, but he never lingers for long&nbsp;because there's always someone or something else to apprehend, preferably as painfully as possible.",

      "biography": "As a teenager, Maxwell Lord arrived home to find his father murdered. Convinced his successful father's powerful business associates were responsible, Lord became sure of one thing that day: power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. When those with super-powers began to appear, Lord believed this philosophy extended to them as well and quickly grew to mistrust them. Those with super powers will always abuse that power—hero or villain, it doesn’t matter.As he grew older, Lord became a shrewd businessman that favored government oversight and Big Brother-like politics over super hero vigilantism. His disdain toward those with super powers led to him growing more and more ruthless and manipulative, and eventually he helped form the Justice League International. He believed that the best way to watch over super heroes was to control them, and that he was the only man trustworthy enough and capable enough for the job. With this power, Lord grew to become one of the greatest threats to the DC Universe. Eventually he gained mind-control capabilities, and once even took control of the Man of Steel himself, sending Superman on a rampage.Maxwell Lord’s ability to control another person's mind extends far beyond the capabilities of most with similar powers, going so far as being able to maintain control after an individual realizes they are being controlled. However, the more he uses his powers, the greater the toll on his body—ranging from a simple nosebleed to, possibly, a fatal brain hemorrhage. Despite the countless lives he's taken in his quest to rid the world of super-powered individuals, Lord sees himself as the real hero. Because in his mind—ironically twisted and corrupted by power—they are the real threat,&nbsp;not him.",

However, despite the brutality and violence inflicted upon him, his will never broke and he never gave up hope. He dreamed of escape. But to escape the unescapable, he would need a miracle—so he became Mister Miracle.In order to stop the destructive and long-waged war between New Genesis and Apokolips, the benevolent Highfather agreed to a gesture of peace: he would exchange sons with Darkseid, effectively condemning his child to the hells of Apokolips. Darkseid turned Scott over to Granny Goodness's \"Orphanage,\" where he was subjected to countless horrors and torture in an effort to destroy the goodness inside him, but Scott refused to surrender his innocence. Never physically powerful, Scott instead began training his mind—mentally distancing himself from the pain and sharpening his reason, logic and problem-solving abilities—turning him into an unparalleled and cunning thinker. When he finally made his escape, he succeeded through brain and not brawn, leaving behind the terror of Apokolips for life on Earth as the super hero Mister Miracle.Mister Miracle shares a close and romantic relationship with his fellow New God Big Barda. The two met on Apokolips and quickly fell in love, despite their contrasting personalities. While Barda loves to fight and relishes battle, Scott is more peaceful and kind and simply wants to fit in and lead a normal life, much to Barda's chagrin. Their contrasting personalities but deep love for one another gives them one of the most unique relationships in the DC Universe.Like all New Gods, Mister Miracle possesses beyond superhuman strength, speed, agility, reflexes, stamina and more. Along with his natural gifts, Mister Miracle carries a number of weapons and advanced Apokoliptian technology, including a Mother Box that can transfer energy, sense danger and life, create force fields, project shock-waves and open boom tubes for travel. He also utilizes personally modified Aero Disks that allow him to fly at speeds of over 200 mph and cling to walls and ceilings.

      "biography": "If it’s hard being a super hero, what is it like as a sidekick? The heroes get the glory, while you clean up the mess. You don’t make the decisions and you don’t give orders. So, what do you do if you’re the Boy Wonder to one of the most recognizable super heroes in the universe and you’re looking to break out on your own?Simple. You become Nightwing.When his circus acrobat family was brutally murdered, Dick Grayson was taken in by billionaire and bat-friendly super hero Bruce Wayne. Bruce shared his secret life as Batman with the young boy and eventually molded him into Robin—the Dark Knight’s partner in Gotham. But as Dick grew older, playing second fiddle to the sternest hero in the Justice League began to wear on him, and eventually he struck out on his own, staying true to what he learned as Robin while coming into his own as a respected member of the super hero pantheon. His code, like his mentor’s, is simple—if you’re breaking the law on his turf, watch out. Anyone who doesn’t can expect a short and most assuredly painful trip to Arkham.Yet, while he may share methods and motivation with Batman, Dick knows what being Batman can do. He doesn’t want to become as dark, controlling and lonely as Bruce. But for all the good he’s accomplished while avoiding it, one question is unavoidable—without going as far as Batman, can Nightwing be as effective as he ultimately wants to be?",

But as the sole witness to the reality-changing events of Crisis on Infinite Earths, the Psycho-Pirate has issues of his own.The original Psycho-Pirate was an underappreciated newspaper typesetter named Charles Halstead, who longed for the world to notice him. By surreptitiously printing his messages in the paper, Halstead adopted the moniker of the Psycho-Pirate for a string of crimes designed to evoke emotional reactions of greed, hate and fear. Halstead was eventually discovered and jailed by the Justice Society of America. He shared a cellmate, a gangster by the name of Roger Hayden.While swapping stories of their lives before prison, an aging Halstead told Hayden about a secret he’d learned in his days as the Psycho-Pirate: the existence of a set of mystical artifacts known as the Medusa Masks, which could be used to manipulate people’s emotions directly. Once Roger Hayden was free from prison, he located these masks and designed a faceplate to flip through them at will, allowing him to project whatever emotions he desired. Though he proves a more formidable foe than his predecessor, Hayden was also soundly defeated in multiple rows with the Justice Society, even when teaming up with the Ultra-Humanite’s Secret Society of Super-Villains.In the Crisis on Infinite Earths, Psycho-Pirate’s particular abilities came in high demand. He was approached by the Monitor, who enlisted him to use his Medusa Mask to call other essential personnel to defend the universe who may otherwise be reticent to join. But it wasn’t long before Psycho-Pirate betrayed the world’s defenders to join the Anti-Monitor after being promised a world of his own in the aftermath. When the Anti-Monitor fell, the Crisis was resolved and the world was remade, Psycho-Pirate remained one of the few beings who remembered the Infinite Earths…a knowledge which drove him insane, committing him to a life in Arkham Asylum.For more on Psycho-Pirate's history, visit his page on DCUniverse.com.",

      "biography": "Powered by the magic of Shazam, these foster brothers and sisters join Billy Batson in battling the forces of evil.In the Golden Age of comics, Billy Batson first proved himself worthy of the powers of the Wizard Shazam. It wasn't long after that the Wizard began extending his powers to other people in Batson's life, making them superheroes as well. Among the first were Billy's sister, Mary Bromfield, who became Mary Marvel, and young Freddy Freeman, who became Captain Marvel Jr. They were eventually joined by the \"Lieutenant Marvels\"—three other boys also named Billy Batson&nbsp;who were nicknamed \"Tall Billy,\" \"Fat Billy\" and \"Hill Billy.\" These three could also access the powers of Shazam when they shouted the magic word in unison. The Marvel Family even had a non-super-powered member in an old man they nicknamed Uncle Dudley, who wore a homemade costume,&nbsp;and Mr. Tawky Tawny and Hoppy the Marvel Bunny, anthropomorphic animals who were considered honorary members.In the post-Flashpoint reality, the Marvel Family goes by the name \"the Shazam Family\" and are all the adopted siblings of Billy Batson, raised in foster care with him by Rosa and Victor Vasquez. Once Billy gained the powers of Shazam, he eventually discovered he could share those powers with members of his new family. Now,&nbsp;when his siblings Darla Dudley, Eugene Choi, Mary Bromfield, Pedro Peña, and Freddy Freeman say the magic word \"Shazam,\"&nbsp;they too become adult superheroes. Each member of this version of the Shazam Family shares their power equally with the others,&nbsp;so if the six members are transformed at once, each of them gets only a fraction of the power level.For more on the Shazam Family's history, visit their page on DCUniverse.com.",

Let those who try to stop what's right, burn like my power, Sinestro's might!\"From the greatest Green Lantern to the Corps' greatest enemy, Thaal Sinestro's fall from grace can easily be attributed to his own hubris—but if you ask him, the real problem lies in the Green Lantern Corps itself and its creators, the Guardians of the Universe. After all, as far as Sinestro is concerned, everything he does is for the good of the universe.Originally hailing from the planet Korugar, Sinestro once served as the Green Lantern of Sector 1417 and quickly gained recognition among the Corps for his ability to police his sector. However, peace came at a price. Sinestro's determination to preserve order caused him to act more as a dictator than a protector, conquering his own home planet in the process. Control became his means to an end, the true path to order in both his sector and the universe as a whole, and Sinestro did anything necessary to achieve it. It wasn't until then new recruit Hal Jordan learned of Sinestro's methods that the Guardians were informed and Sinestro was ejected from the Corps.Steadfast in his belief of moral superiority and methods of maintaining order, Sinestro formed the Sinestro Corps, harnessing the yellow energy of fear, to not only combat the Guardians, whom he sees as the main obstacle on the path to intergalactic peace, but to also strengthen the Green Lantern Corps. For it is Sinestro’s opinion that the Green Lanterns have long since been held back by their creators.Highly intelligent with an almost unbreakable will, Thaal Sinestro will do anything to achieve control and thereby order—control over his emotions, control over others, and even control over the entire universe.",

From the Justice Society of America to the Justice League to many of his fellow super-villains, Savage will face down and eliminate anyone who poses a threat to his supremacy—and has thousands of years of experience and planning to pull it off.Along with his enhanced physical abilities, Savage's intelligence makes him an almost-unparalleled tactician and strategist.

But for those who haven't, one man makes it his duty to break them down in order to make them better, even if he has to force their tragedy himself: Zoom.Hunter Zolomon's life was riddled by brutal tragedies. As a child, he discovered his father was a serial killer who also murdered Hunter's mother after she tried to stop him. This tragedy inspired Hunter to study psychology and criminology, and to join the FBI; but a miscalculation during a case led to the death of his father-in-law. Then, things took a turn for the truly dark after an attack by Gorilla Grodd left Hunter paralyzed. He begged his friend the Flash to go back in time and prevent the attack from happening—and the Flash refused.Taking matters into his own hands, Hunter attempted to go back in time himself, leading to an accidental explosion, another tragedy—but one that made him more than what he was. Gaining the ability of perceived super-speed and adopting the name Zoom, Hunter dedicated his life to making sure people experienced their own personal tragedy in order to make them better heroes—starting with the Flash.Zoom is utterly unlike the Flash and other speedsters, both setting him apart and making him one of the most dangerous and challenging of Flash’s foes. His speed doesn’t come from the Speed Force, but from altering his own relative time, slowing or speeding up the world around him, allowing him to run even faster than the Flash. His warped sense of heroism and villainy has led Zoom to continuously threaten not only those closest to the Flash but also countless heroes throughout the DC Universe.

      "biography": "The 3-D Man was a 1950's hero who came about through the unique merger of two brothers, Hal and Chuck Chandler. Chuck was a test pilot who was abducted by alien Skrulls during an important test flight. Earth was seen as a strategic location in the ongoing conflict between the alien Kree and Skrull Empires, so the Skrulls were seeking information on Earth's space program and had captured Chuck to interrogate him. Chuck resisted and escaped, accidentally causing the explosion of the Skrull spacecraft in the process. While his brother Hal watched, the radiation from the explosion seemingly disintegrated Chuck, who disappeared in a burst of light. Hal later discovered, however, that the light burst had imprinted an image of Chuck on each lens of Hal's eyeglasses. Through concentration, Hal could merge the images and cause Chuck to reappear as a three-dimensional man. Chuck become the costumed adventurer known as the 3-D Man and single-handedly subverted the Skrulls' early attempts to undermine Earthly civilization.Hal would remain comatose whenever the 3-D Man was active but remained aware of the 3-D Man's activities through a mental link. Later, a Skrull's ray weapon altered the transformation so that Hal was the 3-D Man's dominant consciousness for some time. Both brothers' minds seemed to be present in the 3-D Man at all times, but only one of them (usually Chuck) would be in conscious control of the 3-D Man's form on any given occasion.After a brief career as a costumed adventurer, Hal decided to retire the 3-D Man, partly because he was thinking about starting a family, and partly because he was afraid his brother's consciousness might somehow be lost during periods when Hal was the 3-D Man's dominant consciousness. Hal settled down into a career as a research scientist, got married to Chuck's former girlfriend, and raised two sons. He had only activated the 3-D Man twice in recent years, once to fight a rampaging Hulk. During this time as 3-D Man, Chuck seemed to be its dominant consciousness again.More recently, Hal began to feel a strange impulse to travel to the Himalayan Mountains of India. Unbeknownst to him, the presence of a powerful mystical artifact was calling to him. The artifact was a pyramid-shaped shard of light, one of three such shards that were created by the universe in reaction to the presence of pure evil that was cast adrift in this dimension by the extradimensional gods known as the Trion. One of these shards was captured by the Skrulls who had abducted Chuck Chandler, and its energies had merged with Chuck in creating the 3-D Man.Chandler also heard the call of the other shard and mounted an expedition to find it. He was betrayed, however, by Jonathan Tremont, one of the expedition's guides, who claimed the shard for himself. Hal was held captive by Tremont for many years, and Tremont used the power of his shard to create the religious organization called the Triune Understanding. Tremont had discovered the true origin of the shards and hoped to use the Understanding to end the threat of the Trion's cast-off evil, which he termed the \"Triple-Evil.\"Tremont also sought out alternate weapons against the Triple-Evil. He used the power of the shard that was internalized in Hal Chandler to release the powers within a new follower, Delroy Garrett Junior, creating the superhuman champion Triathlon. Triathlon unknowingly held the essence of both Hal and Chuck within himself.Ultimately, Tremont and the hero team Avengers (which now included Triathlon among their members) fought the Triple-Evil and the aliens it had corrupted. Tremont sensed that he might overwhelm the power of the Triple-Evil, to use it for himself to become as a god, and then to reward himself with dominion over all the Earth. Instead, Triathlon found the remaining third shard and, coupling it with the power within him as personified in the 3-D Man, he wrested control of the shard used by Tremont. Using all three shards, a Triathlon/Hal Chandler/Chuck Chandler amalgamation emerged and was able to destroy the Triple-Evil.Triathlon/3-D Man used the pyramid that once housed the Triple-Evil to return the Avengers to Earth, which had since been conquered by the time-traveling Kang. They used the power of the pyramid, channeling the energies of all those fall to its assault for millennia, to fight back and ultimately Kang was defeated.Triathlon returned to Peggy Chandler, separating himself from Hal and Chuck and restoring both of them to physical form. Triathlon found his triple-powers had remained, although Hal and Chuck no longer possessed the power to transform into 3-D Man.Note: In at least one timeline, a team of adventurers known as the Avengers briefly formed in the 1950's before disbanding at the request of the President, who felt the public wasn't ready to learn of them and their exploits. The 3-D Man was part of that short-lived Avengers team, and their rescue of the President from Yellow Claw helped dispel the 3-D Man's reputation as a dangerous outlaw thanks to the President's influence.",

      "biography": "Formerly known as Emil Blonsky, a spy of Soviet Yugoslavian origin working for the KGB, the Abomination gained his powers after receiving a dose of gamma radiation similar to that which transformed Bruce Banner into the incredible Hulk. As a result he was permanently transformed into a massive green-skinned monster whose physical power was equivalent to, if not greater than, that of the Hulk. While he was able to maintain his normal level of self-control and intelligence after this transformation, he is unable to return to human form.Given his gamma-spawned origins, Blonsky blames his condition on Banner and his alter ego, the Hulk. The Abomination and the Hulk have clashed on numerous occasions, with Blonsky perpetually playing the role of the aggressor. Although Blonsky occasionally gains the upper hand in their battles, the Hulk manages to triumph in the end. But not always; the Abomination is one of the few who can lay claim to victory over the green-skinned goliath.In recent years, it was revealed that his hideous new visage had served to alienate Blonsky from his ex-wife, Nadia. Coupled with constant defeats at the hands of the Hulk, this has driven Blonsky nearly insane in his hatred for Banner. The Abomination also grew incensed upon learning that Banner had married Betty Ross, the daughter of General \"Thunderbolt\" Ross. With the loss of his wife, Blonsky figured it is only fair to him that Banner should lose Betty. Out of jealousy, he caused the apparent death of Bruce Banner's wife Betty. While she was recovering from radiation sickness caused by exposure to the gamma radiation within Banner, he poisoned her with his radioactive blood, causing Banner and his associates to believe that her close proximity to the Hulk had given her a fatal case of radiation poisoning. Banner later exposed the Abomination's role in Betty's seeming death, and defeated him in combat.Not only had his grand scheme failed, but Banner also forgave Blonsky. The Abomination could not comprehend and endure his enemy's absolution, and his moment of triumph was twisted into crushing defeat. Blonsky realized he had become what he abhorred the most - it was he who was the rampaging, inhuman monster; not the Hulk as he had religiously believed all these years.Months later, the still-grieving General Ross manipulated the Hulk into attacking and almost killing Blonsky. The Abomination was taken into custody by the military; as punishment, he was forced to watch a film loop of himself and his wife prior to his transformation, making his incarceration a constant reminder of what he has lost.Recently, the Abomination was among the first victims murdered at the hands of the Red Hulk.",

The location of the Ultimate Nullifier was unknown except to the Human Torch, a member of the super hero team the Fantastic Four. With the intention of attracting the attention of the Fantastic Four, Abraxas killed another universe's Galactus, and sent his skull to Earth-616, also using the skull as a homing beacon. This caused a disturbance in the space-time continuum, allowing people from other universes to come through the gap left by the head, including another Nova (Frankie Raye). When the Fantastic Four sought the counsel of the Watcher, they found that he had forgotten who he was, and then he became comatose. Eternity told Mister Fantastic of the Fantastic Four that this was caused by Abraxas.After Mister Fantastic gathered a selection of superheroes to fight the minions of Abraxas on the moon (the home of the Watcher), the Silver Surfer was killed by a mist of micro-organisms as he attempted to defend the Watcher from them. The minions seemed to seek the Human Torch, and after investigation it was discovered that he possessed the coordinates of the Ultimate Nullifier. However they were not only within the mind of their Human Torch, but split between the minds of three other Human Torches in alternate universes.After finding these alternate Human Torches, and passing on the information to the Human Torch of Earth-616, the Fantastic Four found the Ultimate Nullifier. However they were betrayed by the alternate version of Nova, who worked for Abraxas. Abraxas then seemingly destroyed Roma, the protector of Eternity.After Nova gave Abraxas the Ultimate Nullifier, a battle commenced which the Fantastic Four were losing. However Franklin Richards, Mister Fantastic's son who possessed powers that enabled him to warp reality, and Valeria von Doom pooled their powers and revived Galactus from his star-like remains, though the siblings burned out their powers in the act. The newly reformed Galactus then recalled the Ultimate Nullifier from Abraxas' grasp, revealing to all present that the Ultimate Nullifier was actually a part of his being. Due to interference from Nova the Ultimate Nullifier fell to Mister Fantastic, who realised that the only way to destroy Abraxas was to destroy the whole of reality and recreate the multiverse using the Nullifier. After he does so, those who had died, including the Silver Surfer, were brought back to life, Franklin Richards was left without any power, Valeria is replaced with a new baby inside the womb of the Invisible Woman, and the Watcher was returned to normal.",

      "biography": "Crusher Creel's life was little more than that of any common criminal. Although he  did spend some time as a boxer, he usually resorted to petty crime. It was on one such extortion racket that he was convicted of aggravated assault and remanded to prison. Loki, the Asgardian god of mischief, knew Creel would be the perfect unwitting agent to battle Thor, so he slipped an enchanted potion into Creel's drinking water in the prison commissary. Filled with power, Creel broke out of prison and soon found himself in conflict with Thor. He found he could absorb the properties of Thor's hammer as well as Thor himself, and Creel, calling himself the Absorbing Man, managed to force Thor to flee. In fact, Thor was told that his love, Jane Foster, had been kidnapped by Loki, and he left to rescue her. A braggart and lout to the end, Creel flaunted his \"success\" until Thor returned after making sure Jane Foster was safe. A violent battle ensued, but Thor managed to use his hammer's magic to alter the elements Creel had transformed into. Suddenly forced into the qualities of helium, the Absorbing Man drifted apart.Loki wasn't finished with his lackey, yet. He helped Creel re-form his body and transported him to Asgard, in hopes that he would help him take over. But when the Absorbing Man dared to consider his power better than that of Odin's, lord of the Asgardians, he challenged Odin and was waved away, transported into space. Creel eventually managed to return to Earth by hitching a ride on a comet and immediately encountered the Hulk. The Absorbing Man nearly defeated his powerful opponent, lying him low and about to crush him with a huge boulder. But, in absorbing the Hulk's power during his transformation back into his alter ego, Bruce Banner, Creel was also transformed back to normal and buried by his own boulder. Loki freed him again so as to challenge Thor once more, but Thor tricked him into turning into water, and the Absorbing Man was dissipated. A short time later, Creel managed to reintegrate himself, fight Thor and later the Hulk, only to find himself defeated time and again.Eventually reassembling his body after his last defeat, Creel was fed up at fighting and losing to super-human champions. He wanted to flee the country, but by taking a hostage, he alerted his presence to the Avengers. Even though he managed to keep the Avengers at bay, Creel escaped by diving into the ocean, transforming himself into water. He finally reintegrated himself on Easter Island but suffered from a deranged mind as a result of his body being so long intermingled with the ocean. Neurotically frightened of any one with a superpower, he was convinced that the normal Bruce Banner, who also happened upon the island when fleeing Japan as the Hulk, was a superhuman. It was only a matter of time before the Absorbing Man and the Hulk clashed, and Creel tried to absorb the entire island to defeat him. The Hulk swatted him away, and Creel's mental state made him think he actually was an island, floating mindlessly at sea. Eventually coming to his right mind and returning to America, he stalked Dazzler to acquire her light-powers to use against the Avengers. He was defeated, however, when Dazzler sought aid from the Fantastic Four and found Black Bolt instead. Black Bolt's sonic powers combined with Dazzler to overpower the Absorbing Man.Creel was abducted from prison by the omnipotent alien known as the Beyonder to fight in the so-called Secret Wars, after which he was restored to Earth. During this time, Creel met the villainess Titania (Mary MacPherran), and the two developed a relationship. Upon their return, Creel and Titania were contacted by the second Baron Zemo, who was forming a new Masters of Evil. After several independent assignments, they were defeated by the Ant-Man (Scott Lang) and the Wasp.Creel continued to engage in various criminal activities, most often with Titania, although the two often ran afoul of one superhero or another, including his arch-enemy Thor. Perhaps again tiring of battling superhuman opponents, the Absorbing Man seemed committed to try to give up his criminal ways, earning a friendly respect with the hero Thunderstrike, but later abandoned such attempts. After many months, Titania and Creel got married. Both villains had turned away from more malicious actions, preferring to quietly keep each other's company, although they never gave up bank robberies and other activities completely. Creel and Titania occasionally continued to come into conflict with superheroes, such as when the Black Widow (Natasha Romanova) was under a vendetta to dispose of all Avengers' villains, and she shattered Creel's altered form. Another time, Creel was duped by the villain Crossbones to keep Captain America busy while Crossbones ignited a bomb. Creel, however, claiming not to be a murderer, absorbed the properties of Captain America's shield to save the city from the explosion. Creel escaped to seek revenge on Crossbones, but the details of the outcome have yet to be revealed.When Titania was diagnosed with cancer, the couple felt that they had nowhere to turn. They kidnapped a doctor but were confronted by Thor, who convinced them to seek professional care. About this time, Thor assumed the rule of Asgard and brought it into Earth's plane of existence. He attracted a religious following while helping humanity, and Creel became one of his followers.At some point, Creel was imprisoned in a maximum-security penitentiary. He had also somehow developed a new aspect of his powers, allowing him to take over the mind of another. He used this ability to take control of the Hulk and make an escape. In the battle that followed, the Absorbing Man defeated the Hulk but was tricked into trying to take over the mind of a corpse. His real body withered and died. He was imprisoned again, serving time at Pym Experimental Penitentiary Number One, a prison that kept its super-powered inmates miniaturized, and participated in a breakout led by the Mad Thinker only to be thwarted by She-Hulk.",

      "biography": "Once a Mutate on the island nation of Genosha, Abyss was among many who contracted the deadly mutant-killing Legacy Virus. Professor Charles Xavier recruited Abyss into the Mutant Underground, a secret cabal of both mutants and pro-mutant human supporters fighting for the vindication of mutantkind, and assigned him as a bodyguard for Genoshan scientist Renee Majcomb who was researching a cure for the Virus. Secreted away deep in the Louisiana bayou, Abyss aided the mutant soldier from the future Cable, his mercenary ally Domino and the techno-organic alien Douglock in preventing First Strike soldiers from the anti-mutant taskforce Operation: Zero Tolerance from capturing Majcomb.After a cure for the Virus had been released, Abyss found himself in Berlin battling the fire-wielding mutant Fever Pitch. Both were captured by the mutant X-Corps militia led by the former X-Man Banshee. While being held for scientific study, Abyss witnessed the murder of the Japanese mutant Sunpyre by rogue X-Corps members. Following the revelation that the shape-changing mutant terrorist Mystique had infiltrated the X-Corps in an attempt to seize its assets for her own use, a wounded Banshee freed Abyss from his confinement, allowing him to use his power to pull Mystique into the void within his body.Later, Abyss was mentally compelled to travel to the Caribbean island of Isla des Demonas where he joined the X-Man Nightcrawler and other mutants with teleportation powers in creating a portal to the other-dimensional home of Azazel, a demonic-looking mutant from ancient times who was amassing an army with which to reclaim the Earth. The X-Men arrived to rescue their teammate, and inadvertently caused the collapse of the portal. Many of the teleporters were killed, but not before all assembled were transported through to the other dimension. There, Abyss' powers acted in reverse, ejecting everything the void within his body had ever pulled in, including Mystique. Azazel subsequently revealed that he was the father of the teleporters, collectively referred to as the Neyaphem, and sought to enlist the aid of Nightcrawler and Abyss in opening another portal to Earth. At that moment, back on Earth, the X-Man Polaris used her magnetic powers to force open the void within Abyss' body, allowing the heroes to return and leaving Azazel and his followers trapped.Following the advent of House of M|\"M-Day\", Abyss was one of many mutants who were stripped of their mutant nature to become ordinary humans.",

      "biography": "Most of Abyss' life is shrouded in mystery. It is known that he is the son of Mystique but neither he nor Nightcrawler realize they are brothers. It is also rumored that he fought his way out of Sinister&amp;s labs. But instead of escaping, he fought his way into Apocalypse's lair and assassinated a Horseman by the name of Bastion. Impressed by the boy's tenacity, Apocalypse made him his youngest Horseman.  During the evacuation of Maine, Abyss was in charge of stopping the X-Men and the Sentinels from helping the humans escape North America. He kidnapped a young boy and used him to draw Quicksilver into the open. Obviously obsessed with impressing Apocalypse by capturing the son of Magneto, Abyss abandoned his main goal of stopping the evacuation and allowed it to occur. He met Quicksilver but was unable to defeat the X-Men leader. Quicksilver was able to save the kidnapped boy and defeat Abyss with the help of his fellow X-Man, Storm. Following this defeat, Abyss was placed in charge of interrogating the mysterious man known as Bishop. With the assistance of the Shadow King and the Madri Abyss began his interrogation. The X-Men staged a daring raid to free him and Abyss allowed his ego to get in the way of completing his mission. This time it cost him more than just his objective, however. Abyss underestimated the strength of the mutant Banshee and his sonic scream. Flying into Abyss, Banshee cut loose with the full fury of his powers and it appeared that he ripped Abyss apart. Abyss has not been heard from since and it is assumed that he is dead. But whether a mutant with his powers and no true physical form could ever truly die is unknown.",

      "biography": "Reverend Doctor Michael Ibn al-Hajj Achebe's true identity remains unknown. Stories persist that he was originally a Ghudazian farmer until Ujankan guerillas took refuge in his home, repaying his hospitality by stabbing him repeatedly, burning his farm, and stealing his unfaithful wife. Refusing to die, the farmer sold his soul to the devil for revenge, hunting down and slaying everyone associated with his wife, from close family to casual acquaintances.Though that tale remains unconfirmed, Achebe did sell his soul to the demon Mephisto. Earning multiple degrees in America, he formed ties with rogue elements in the U.S. intelligence community. Ghudaza shared a border with the technologically advanced Wakanda, and Achebe's new allies saw him as a means to access restricted Wakandan information denied them by the the Wakandan king T'Challa, also known as the Black Panther. Achebe was repatriated, and through a complex series of deniable intermediaries, including Spectrum Dynamics, the Russian Mafia, and the Volcan Domuyan secret police, his allies instigated a bloody, ethnic civil war in Ghudaza. Thousands of refugees fled into Wakanda, Achebe included, and were housed in makeshift camps. T'Challa's decision to accept these outsiders angered many more insular Wakandans, while the refugees grew restless over the poor living conditions in the camps.T'Challa was aware that the situation had been engineered, but played along to draw his enemies into the open. Achebe's allies lured T'Challa to America by creating a scandal in the Wakandan-backed Tomorrow Fund charity, and Achebe led a coup in his absence. T'Challa's step-mother Ramonda agreed to share power with Achebe. Publicly this alliance was to halt the civil war; secretly, it was to spy on Achebe for T'Challa while appearing to betray her stepson. Achebe's secret U.S. backers lost control of him when T'Challa forced Mephisto to cut Achebe loose.  This caused Achebe's insanity to worsen. Now taking advice from his hand puppet Daki, Achebe had T'Challa's fiancée kidnapped and turned into a human bomb. T'Challa rescued her, and rooted out Achebe's allies. Achebe responded by activating giant Panther \"Prowler\" robots designed to defend Wakanda's capital, turning them on the citizens. T'Challa returned to confront Achebe, who escaped disguised as the Black Panther after threatening to blow up the palace. Achebe went into hiding, briefly emerging to torture the renegade Dora Milaje Nakia (T'Challa's former ally). Months later, when T'Challa was deposed as Black Panther by Erik Killmonger, Achebe hired Deadpool and his allies to kidnap Killmonger's leopard companion Preyy.  Achebe hoped that Deadpool would slay Killmonger, thus restoring Achebe's \"playmate\" T'Challa. When this failed, Achebe killed Preyy and went back into hiding.",

      "biography": "The complete history of Aegis is unknown. She has existed in this universe since its infancy. She is a proemial being. It is said that she prepared what exist for what is to come, by eliminating early lifeforms such as the Chaos Mites. It is documented that ages ago she was known and feared as Aegis (Lady of All Sorrows). Time has erased nearly all of her evil. In an early battle of the Gods Tenebrous and Aegis were among the only remaining survivors of a brutal battle with Galactus. They were imprisoned in the prison planetoid known as the Kyln by the World Devourer Galactus. The Kyln is located at the edge of the universe in a sector known as the Crunch Cascade. They remained locked in there for centuries.Unfortunately it was through the Crunch Cascade that the Annihilation Wave started its invasion of the positive universe. The wave did irreparable damage to the Kyln, and Aegis and Tenebrous were released back into the living universe once more, adding further fuel to the chaos that was engulfing all life. They were two other former powerful inmates freed from the Kyln, Kosmos the Maker formerly the Beyonder, and the Fallen One first Herald of Galactus. After Tenebrous captured and drained the Fallen One of his power, leaving him as a lifeless husk. Thanos of Titan came to the rescue of the Fallen One. Aegis noticed a small winged woman on the shoulder of Thanos. She stated that she was indeed a Chaos Mite. Aegis was puzzled as to how the Mite (Skreet) had managed to escape the great purge. Skreet refused to reveal her secrete.leftAegis and Tenebrous confronted Galactus and his newly restored Herald the Silver Surfer in battle. Galactus and the Silver Surfer were easily defeated and left for Thanos to strip them of the Power Cosmic. Thanos who had struck and alliance with Annihilus of the Negative Zone. Thanos worked diligently to remove the Power Cosmic. Tenebrous and Aegis disappeared into the cosmos. They later returned to the ruins of the Kyln hoping to find the other Proemial Gods, which could have also been prisoners there. To their disappointment they found the fallen body of Antiphon the Overseer. He had apparently fell victim to the destruction of the Kyln. The Silver Surfer who had escaped captivity tracked down the two Gods. He defeated them by using the powers of the Crunch to destroy them once and for all.",

      "biography": "Trey Rollins grew up in a rough Brooklyn neighborhood, avoiding the local street gangs and concentrating on his study of classical mythology. His close friend James once pushed Trey to safety during a drive-by gang shooting, but James himself would later join the street gang Lobo's Boys. On his way home from school one afternoon, the teenage Trey heard a strange noise coming from an abandoned building. Inside, Trey found a mystical breastplate he recognized as the Aegis, the legendary Medusa-faced shield of the Greek goddess Athena. Using the breastplate, Rollins became a masked crime-fighter as Aegis, winning the admiration of locals, including  young graffiti artists Lester and Payton. After helping the New Warriors defeat the alien menace Blastaar, Aegis was awarded Warriors membership. However, the Warriors in general and Nova in particular were slow to trust the inexperienced Aegis, partly because he was the only member of the group who insisted on concealing his secret identity from the others. When Brooklyn-area street gangs began wielding high-tech A.I.M. weapons, the Warriors set out to stop the gang war and cut off the weaponry supply. Aegis repeatedly protected James during this conflict, but an ungrateful James nearly killed the Warriors several times over. He also threatened to expose Trey's dual identity, and helped Lobo's Boys destroy the Warriors' Crashpad headquarters. The Warriors eventually nailed the arms dealer supplying the gangs, organized crime boss Joseph Manfredi, and defeated his armored enforcers Heavy Mettle.  James fled into hiding after killing a member of the rival Born 2 Die gang during a scuffle. Trying to explain his ties to James, Trey finally shared his true identity with the Warriors and began to bond with the team. When the Greek demigod Hercules mistakenly accused Trey of stealing the Aegis, the goddess Athena revealed that she had left it for Trey to find as a gift, and declared Trey her newest mortal champion. With the support and blessing of Athena and the other Olympian gods, Trey found new confidence as a hero. However, Aegis has been seldom seen of late, perhaps because he needs to keep his school grades up if he hopes to qualify for a college scholarship.",

In exchange for knowledge, he would assemble the world's greatest mystics every century, presiding over a contest for the role of Sorcerer Supreme. Reportedly extending his life via the Pool of Blood, he performed his duty for untold millennia. For centuries he has dwelled in a Tibetan cavern in the foothills of the Himalayas, watched over by manservants. His mind long ago consumed by mystic forces swirling about reality, his original name lost to the eons, he became the Aged Genghis. Many travelers sought his training, but most, if not all, were turned away. Some twenty years ago he was approached by the freshly scarred Victor von Doom; refusing to train Doom even after a beating, Genghis instead referred him to an order of monks who would guide him to his destiny. Dr. Strange found and nursed the Genghis back to health after the attack.More recently, Dr. Strange sought the Genghis' aid in locating Eternity to save the Ancient One, but the senile wizard instead gave him a scroll that transported Strange to the Netherworld of Eternal Doom. There Strange faced the Demon of the Mask. Further efforts by Dr. Strange, Clea, and others to gain the Genghis' aid met with similar frustration. Strange was once nearly destroyed by the Genghis' madness given form when he tried to bring him to his New York Sanctum Sanctorum for better care.. During moments of greater clarity, the Genghis referred would-be disciples to Strange. Allegedly Jefferson Archer, the future Highwayman, was among those refused by the Genghis. When the Time of the Vishanti arrived, Genghis briefly regained his wits and summoned the sorcerers of Earth to the Temple of the Three in the Javan Rainforest of South East Asia. Dr. Strange won the contest, but was forced to grant a boon to the runner-up, Dr. Doom. This lead to Doom and Strange rescuing Doom's mother, Cynthia, from the clutches of the Hell-lord Mephisto.",

His clients included American, British, Japanese, French, and Israeli government agencies, as well as international agencies such as S.H.I.E.L.D. Son of the criminal machinesmith Tinkerer, Rick grew up exposed to the latest technologies and their criminal users. He immersed himself in covert activities, working beside or studying under operatives including Nick Fury, the Cat (Shen Kuei), Teng Yun-Suan, Dennis Nayland and Alexi Vazhin. His solo defeat of the Arcfire Network cemented his status as a major player.Working for Great Britain, Mason uncovered a plot by the renegades Dog, Monkey, and Horse from the strike team China Force (with assistance from duped agents Silver, Auric, and She-Devil) to overthrow Hong Kong's British regime. Battling Horse, an overmatched Mason prevailed by throwing them both over a twenty story balcony, angling himself into a hotel pool while the Horse apparently fell to his death. Shortly thereafter, Nick Fury asked Mason to intervene in the South American country of Costa Brava, where American backed rebels had been supplanted by super-powered mercenaries. Fury had to oppose the American-backed forces; Mason was his solution. Seeing parallels to Hong Kong, Mason entered Costa Brava and captured two of the five mercenaries- Zapper, a mutant British energy generator, and Noise (Julio Mendoza), a mutant Mexican sound controller. He interrogated, tranquilized and abandoned them in uncharted jungle, miles from civilization. Mason was briefly caught and tortured by Black Metal (a South American high-tech mercenary) before escaping. He then captured the final two superhumans (Quota, an African cyborg, and Stealth, a flying Irish/Argentinean mutant) and used them to lure Black Metal into an ambush in an exploding warehouse. The five eliminated, the rebels reclaimed Costa Brava's capital of San Gabriel, installing their leader, Javier La Brava, as president. Rick learned that a former teacher, Chinese geomancer Teng Yun-Suan, was the power behind the takeover attempts.  Mason was forced to kill Teng.The Corporation once kidnapped Rick to coerce his father to work for them.  The Tinkerer recruited Luke Cage and Dakota North to rescue Rick, but Mason escaped his captors using a light bulb filament as a lock pick, and helped the pair defeat the Corporation. Mason is also believed to have been a victim of a Carrion Plague outbreak before being cured by S.H.I.E.L.D. Rick Mason is currently believed dead, assassinated by an unnamed super-villain; with Mason's apparent death, his identity as the Agent became public knowledge.",

Nijo was killed by the Swan after refusing to kill Deadpool's assistant, Sandi Brandenberg. Confronted by Deadpool, the Swan's powers flared out of control, telepathically linking their minds and mixing traits and abilities before the bomb detonated. Now sharing Deadpool's healing factor, Nijo was resurrected, but with no memory of his identity or past except for a burning ambition to become the world's best mercenary. He instinctively sought out Sandi, who took him in due to his resemblance to Deadpool. He named himself Alex Hayden after the composers Alexander Grieg and Josef Haydn, Sandi enlisted the help of her mercenary boyfriend Taskmaster and the gunslinger Outlaw for Hayden's training, creating within him a combination of Deadpool's and the Swan's skills.Alex and Sandi formed the Agency X mercenary service, and were paid for their first job with a run-down amusement park.  With Agency X, Alex romanced Outlaw and entered a challenge to steal the Punisher's guns.  He also encountered the young mutant Mary Zero, whose power prevented everyone except Alex from noticing her existence.  Alex also roughed up the creator of Internet pop-up ads, hired Arcade to upgrade the amusement park, and clashed with the Four Winds and their new leader, Higashi.

      "biography": "Born in the former East Germany, Christoph Nord was an idealist who fought against the communist regime as a freedom fighter for the West German Cell Six. Nord’s brother Andreas fought for the East Germans, and when the two met in battle Nord was forced to kill his brother. Later, after an encounter with an assassin called the Confessor, Nord was recovering in a German hospital where he fell in love with nurse Ginetta Barsalini. The two married, and she soon fell pregnant, but he later learned that she was a double agent and was forced to kill her after she attacked him. Guilt and pain drove him further into his mercenary work, and he eventually accepted an offer to join the Central Intelligence Agency’s Weapon X Program. Nord joined the Program’s covert operations unit Team X, changed his name to David North, and took the codename Maverick.In recent years, Japanese crimelord Matsu’o Tsurayaba and his allies, including former Weapon X scientist Doctor Cornelius, resurrected the Russian super-soldier Omega Red. In order to stabilize his mutant power, Omega Red required the Carbonadium Synthesizer, a device stolen from him by Team X decades earlier. Omega Red captured Maverick’s former Team X teammate Wolverine, who had the location of the C-Synthesizer buried in his memory, and several of Wolverine’s teammates in the X-Men. Maverick was hired by former Team X liaison Major Arthur Barrington to prevent Omega Red from obtaining the device, and he tracked another former Team X member, Sabretooth, to Omega Red’s location. With Maverick’s help, the X-Men were able to defeat the villains, and he subsequently killed Cornelius in an act of revenge.Barrington later sent Maverick to recover documents known as the Xavier Files, after the father of the X-Men’s telepathic founder, Professor Charles Xavier. The files were in the possession of a former colleague of Xavier’s father, Doctor Alexander Ryking, who was under the protection of the superhuman mercenary Warhawk. During the ensuing clash, Warhawk exploded, killing Ryking and seemingly destroying the files.Maverick was then assigned by the U.S. Government to protect Aldo Ferro, a former Weapon X ally. Maverick’s former Team X alumni sought Ferro after one of their number, Mastodon, died when his age suppression factor was seemingly reversed. Unbeknownst to Team X, Ferro was responsible for secretly implanting them all with false memories during their time with Weapon X. After Ferro betrayed Maverick, he sided with his former teammates against Ferro who was seemingly killed in the subsequent battle.Maverick next sought to hunt down Sabretooth to make him pay for his numerous crimes, and joined forces with the X-Men in capturing him. Maverick subsequently learned that he had contracted the deadly mutant-killing Legacy Virus. He asked Wolverine to kill him in order to avoid prolonged suffering, but Wolverine refused and Maverick came to form a sibling-like bond with another Virus sufferer, Chris Bradley.During the final stages of his infection, Maverick encountered the Russian mutant telepath Elena Ivanova who was hunting Sabretooth to avenge his murder of her mother. The Virus claimed Maverick’s life, but Ivanova managed to use her powers to coax him back to life. As a result, Maverick’s Legacy Virus went into full remission and his powers further mutated.Maverick was then captured by Russian crimelord Ivan Pushkin, whose scientists implanted false memories into Maverick’s mind to make him believe that Barrington had been responsible for his wife’s betrayal. Pushkin intended for Maverick to kill Barrington to prevent him from providing testimony that threatened Pushkin’s financial interests. Maverick located Barrington’s safehouse but was opposed by members of the Canadian super-team Alpha Flight. Maverick overcame Pushkin’s mental manipulation, however it was too late to save Barrington from Pushkin’s agents, Hammer and Sickle.In a later encounter with Hammer and Sickle, Maverick’s left eye was gouged out by Sickle, and he was left to die in the Swiss Alps. Forced to cauterize the wound to stop from bleeding to death, Maverick survived and later resurfaced to aid Wolverine against a revived Weapon X Program. This new Program sent Sabretooth to recruit both Maverick and fellow Team X alumnus John Wraith. Neither accepted the offer, and so Sabretooth killed Wraith and critically injured Maverick. Brought to the Program with only minutes to live, Maverick reluctantly joined in order to survive and was genetically modified to become Agent Zero.Although an efficient operative, Zero hated what he had become and frequently considered suicide. On his first assignment as Zero, he was sent to assassinate Wolverine in an attempt by the Director to further break his spirit. Deliberately missing his target, Zero was punished with an electric shock. Later, Zero recaptured Sabretooth after his betrayal of the Program and would have killed him had the Director not shocked him again.After a change in leadership of the Program, Zero was assigned to track the anti-human terrorist group Gene Nation that had been revived by former Weapon X operative Marrow. Confronting her, Zero learned that her latest recruit, a man using his former identity of Maverick, had been sent to attack New York’s Grand Central Station. Confronting the impostor, Zero inflicted a fatal wound upon him only to learn that it was his friend, Chris. Zero then set about the task of wiping out Gene Nation with new zeal, although he declined to make Marrow a martyr. Returning to an abandoned Weapon X facility, Zero’s investigations led him to join Wolverine and the enigmatic mercenary Fantomex in opposing the Project’s original founder, John Sublime.",

      "biography": "Rory Campbell was a psychologist who joined Moira MacTaggert's genetic research team at the Muir Island Mutant Research Center while the British super-team Excalibur was stationed there. He discovered that in the alternate future of Earth-811 (\"Days of Future Past\"), he became the mutant-hunter Ahab, creating and leading hordes of mutant trackers called \"Hounds.\" Rory decided to prevent that future from coming to pass. When Excalibur captured the feral mutant Spoor, then an Acolyte of Magneto, Rory had a special room constructed with a laser-web that reacted to hostile actions. Using mood-altering pheromones, Spoor provoked Rory into attacking him, causing the lasers to amputate Rory's left leg. Soon after, Rory accepted a position of mutant liaison and management within the restructured W.H.O. (Weird Happenings Organization). He also traded information on the Legacy Virus to Sebastian Shaw of the Hellfire Club, in exchange for a bionic leg. Succumbing to the influence of the mutant Apocalypse, Rory became the Horseman of Apocalypse Famine. In this capacity, he captured Sunfire, one of the Twelve, a group of mutants destined to usher in a golden era for their kind. Famine later clashed with members of The Twelve after they escaped Apocalypse, and was teleported away with the other Horsemen by Mikhail Rasputin. Campbell's whereabouts since are unknown.In the future of Earth-811, Campbell, as Ahab, led the Hound program, which was commissioned to track down and capture mutants. Ahab's greatest Hound creation was Rachel Summers, the telepathic daughter of Earth-811's Cyclops and Jean Grey. Rachel ultimately fought back;  before she was recaptured, she hurled Ahab into a bank of computers which mangled his body.   Ahab was confined to a hover-chair and became a cyborg. When Rachel fled to the past of Earth-616, Ahab pursued her there using the time-wandering spirit of the adult Earth-811 Franklin Richards. Ahab created Hounds out of Cyclops and Franklin's mother, the Invisible Woman, but was forced back to his own time by the combined efforts of the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, Cable's New Mutants, and X-Factor. After joining Excalibur, Rachel traveled back to the future of Earth-811 and finally defeated Ahab with her team mates' aid by reprogramming the Sentinel's Prime Directive to ensure they would protect all life, ending their threat to mutants.The current exploits of Ahab are unknown.",

      "biography": "POWERS\n\nAjak possesses the conventional powers of the Eternals, including superhuman strength enabling him to lift 25 tons, complete control over the atoms of his body allowing him to regenerate after virtually any injury, the ability to project cosmic energy from his eyes or hands in the form of heat, light or concussive force, teleportation, flight at the speed of sound and the ability to rearrange the molecular structure of objects. Ajak is also a brilliant archaeologist and skilled wrestler\n\nORIGINS\n\nAjak is a member of the Polar Eternals, a band of the near-immortal Eternals whose outpost lay within the Ural Mountains of Russia. Ajak’s earliest known interactions with humanity occurred in Babylon around 2500 BC when he was among the Eternals who clashed with the Deviants and their leader, Warlord Kro. Around 1200 BC, Ajak and his brother Arex were active in Greece where they were known respectively as Ajax the Greater and Ajax the Lesser. Around 1000 AD, Ajak interacted with the natives of South America where he assumed the identity of the Incan god Tecumotzin and the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl as he used the Eternals’ advanced knowledge to assist them. When the Celestials who created the Eternals and Deviants visited Peru around that time as part of their Third Host, Ajak performed the role of communicator with them, imparting messages from the Host to the Eternals, even delivering a warning from the Celestials to the gods of Earth. After the Third Host departed Ajak placed himself into suspended animation alongside a team of Eternals who were his assistants within the City of the Space Gods, which had been constructed in Peru for the Celestials’ use.\n\n\nIn recent years, Ajak and his men were awakened from their slumber by fellow Eternal Ikaris just in time to greet the Fourth Host of the Celestials. Ajak once again served as communicator and befriended the human archaeologist Dr. Daniel Damian, revealing many of the secrets of the City of the Space Gods to him. The Celestials ultimately judged in Earth’s favor and departed. Soon after, Ajak was among the party of Eternals who assumed the form of the psychic Uni-Mind entity to explore other worlds. Ajak eventually returned to the City of the Space Gods, but while he was away Damian’s daughter Margo had been slain by the Deviants. Blaming the Eternals and Deviants for her death, Damian used Celestial technology to transform Ajak into a monster and sent him to slay Deborah and Thomas Ritter, the offspring of Kro and Thena. Although the children were saved and Ajak was returned to normal, he had killed other children in his hunt and was haunted by their deaths and the betrayal of Damian. Ajak chose to disintegrate himself, destroying Damian in the process.\n\n\nAjak was later resurrected through unknown means but had become amnesiac due to the manipulations of Sprite, a young Eternal who sought to become mortal. In doing so, Sprite awoke the Dreaming Celestial, a seemingly malevolent Celestial who had lain dormant on Earth for thousands of years. Ajak was cast into the role of a gardener until the Eternals’ leader Zuras restored him. Zuras then had Ajak hire a pair of Deviants to assault Ikaris in order to restore his memory. The awakened Dreaming Celestial chose to communicate through the Eternal Makkari, slighting Ajak. At the same time, Ajak was asked by the Aztec, Incan and Mayan gods to represent them as part of the so-called “God Squad” assembled by the Olympian goddess Athena. Led by Hercules, the God Squad was dispatched to confront the gods of the extraterrestrial Skrulls, as the Skrulls were in the process of invading the Earth. During the battle against the gods Kly’bn and Sl’gur’t, Ajak was mortally wounded but regenerated from his injuries. Returning to the Eternals, Ajak revived the memories of the Forgotten One and sent him to attack Olympia and kill Makkari so that he could have revenge; Ajak nearly doomed the Earth by upsetting the Dreaming Celestial, but Sersi restored Makkari to life.",

      "biography": "Pharaoh during Egypt's 18th Dynasty, Amenhotep established a monotheistic religion worshipping the sun god Aten, alleged creator of the universe.  Some historians regard this as a predecessor of current monotheisms. Changing his name to Akhenaten, he established Aten-devoted cities in Egypt, Nubia, and Syria, attempting to obliterate all worship of the Egyptian Gods Helopolitans and Ennead. He moved Egypt's capital city from Thebes to the newly built Akhenaten. His priests secretly continued their polytheistic worship. At one point the mutant Apocalypse posed as Aten during a meeting with Akhenaten.In 1334 B.C., after a 17 year reign, Akhenaten was abducted by the alien Cosmic Order, who had two millennia before discovered and accessed the vast power of the Heart of the Infinite. The Cosmic Order used their ultimate might to force peace onto the universe. They sought local humans to guide each space sector through this transition, and Akhenaten's ruthless leadership history and vision for the future made him an ideal candidate. For nearly two millennia, Akhenaten danced with insanity. His son succeeded him as Pharaoh, only to be murdered by General Horemheb, who eradicated all traces of Akhenaten and restored worship of the gods of old. Eventually acclimating to his cosmic role, Akhenaten earned the Cosmic Order's full trust and mastered the Heart's power over two millennia more.Plotting to betray and conquer the Cosmic Order, Akhenaten returned to Earth in recent years, proclaiming himself its ruler and slaying opposition, including many superheroes and Godheads of Earthly pantheons. Even the cosmic Eternity and Infinity were blinded to Akhenaten's existence. Dr. Doom learned Akhenaten's origins, and traveled back in time to slay him before he gained power, but Akhenaten anticipated this and foiled him. The mad Titan Thanos, seeking the Heart of the Infinite's power for his own ends, teamed with the Defenders (Doctor Strange, Hulk, Namor the Sub-Mariner, and Silver Surfer) and Captain Marvel (Genis-Vell) to infiltrate the Cosmic Order's space station. Their secret revealed by the Hulk's rampage, they nonetheless located the Heart and severed the Order's instrumentation. Accessing and becoming one with the Heart of the Infinite, Thanos easily overpowered Akhenaten, leaving him to a vengeful Doom. Thanos then eradicated the Celestial Order's race in a past time period before they first accessed the Heart and pronounced him God, effectively preventing Akhenaten's assault on Earth and erasing his actions since encountering the Order. Thanos ultimately relinquished his new power to repair a terminal defect in the fabric of reality.Note: Akhenaten is distinguished from the earlier Amenhotep, later a vampire in the Legion of the Unliving.",

      "biography": "A pair of androids built in the Reavers' Australian Outback base by Donald Pierce to destroy Wolverine, Albert and Elsie-Dee form a most unusual partnership. Albert impersonated Wolverine to draw him out, while the explosive-packed Elsie-Dee was given the form of a five-year-old girl to get Wolverine close enough to blow him up. Pierce intended Elsie-Dee to have a child-like intellect, thus preventing her from trying to save herself by disarming her explosives.  However, Bone-Breaker botched this part of the programming, giving Elsie a genius I.Q. Unable to override her own programming, she instead increased the intellect of her partner (whom she named Albert, after Einstein), hoping this would help him defeat Wolverine and negate her drive to explode. Albert ambushed his prey beneath an L.A. pier, but lost the fight and was badly damaged. Elsie-Dee set a fire, and then posed as a trapped child to draw Wolverine in. Wolverine rescued her, but Elsie-Dee decided she could not kill someone who truly cared for her.  She confessed her true nature to Wolverine, using all her willpower to override the detonation program. Wolverine refused to leave her to her fate; she hacked into the N.S.A. computer network, seeking to decode the arming sequence. Albert, who had slipped away during the fire to repair himself, hijacked a Radio Hut store to acquire more computing power, and cracked the code. Forge examined Elsie-Dee, but could not remove the explosives. Albert stole a Stealth jet to rejoin Elsie-Dee, but was shot down over Manhattan by the U.S. Air Force, and crashed into the waters below. Both androids moved into the sewer system, where Elsie-Dee encountered Cable and Sabretooth; with her head detached, she remotely exploded her body, destroying the pump room to save them from drowning. As S.H.I.E.L.D. removed them from the area, Sabretooth broke free and attacked Wolverine; Elsie bit Sabretooth, causing him to leap from the copter. Albert retrieved her head, and swiftly built Elsie a new form. Albert also repaired the jet and the androids departed alongside the \"Hunter in Darkness,\" a vaguely humanoid lupine from Canada which Elsie befriended and renamed Puppy. Traveling to Canada, they found a burial mound containing a clawed Adamantium skeleton. Bargaining with Spiral to be sent back in time, the trio arrived in the middle of a battle between rival factions of the Siksika tribe. Elsie-Dee and Albert encountered a temporally displaced Forge and Wolverine from a decade ahead of their own era, who had traveled back to combat the Adversary. Forge and Wolverine vanished through time again; with no access to time travel, Albert and Elsie-Dee stayed with the Siksika until their batteries ran down. They were found in the modern era by Bloodscream, who recharged them. Albert located their modified Stealth jet, and the pair resumed their travels together.",

As Albion, Hunter became a great British hero during World War I. His powers faded after the war, though he remained remarkably vital for a man his age. In the modern era, one of Peter's pupils at Gatton, Cam McClellan, was possessed by the Pendragon power. The youth was unable to handle it and fell prey to the Green Knight's enemies, the Bane. Hunter and fellow Pendragons Ben Gallagher, Union Jack, and Cam's mother, Kate, went to Joselito, Spain, where they encountered the Bane's pawn, Francesca Grace. Hunter convinced Cam to return the Pendragon power to him, allowing him to become Albion. Taking an extended leave of absence from school, Albion became a leader of the new Knights of Pendragon, and investigated the return of the Bane's leader, the Red Lord. Captured and killed by Grace, Albion was resurrected by the Green Knight to take part in the final defense of the Green Chapel in the realm of Avalon. Victorious, the Knights used the Chapel as their base for months. Albion officially became the group's leader, overseeing battles against Mys-Tech, Magpie, Baron Blood, and Shadow Wing, and began romancing his former enemy turned team mate, Grace. The Knights also teamed with Spider-Man to prevent the devastation of the planet Arakne. Unknown to the Pendragons, their actions had cataclysmic effects on Earth-313. The Lemurians of that Earth sought revenge by sending the assassin Death's Head after the Pendragons.  In the end, Albion and his team mates Breeze and Gawain agreed to remain on the ravaged world to help rebuild it.Later recruited into the Time Guardian's Dark Guard - alongside Dark Angel, Motormouth, Killpower, Death's Head, and others - and charged with protecting the galaxy from Mys-Tech, Albion and his allies defeated the evil Collapsar, who threatened the balance of power on the planet Eopia.

Her mother married her father's partner, the man who would eventually become the Puppet Master. After her mother died, Phillip Masters raised Alicia alone.When her stepfather used his abilities to control the Fantastic Four's Thing and bring him to his apartment for revenge, Alicia sensed the presence of the Invisible Girl, allowing the Puppet Master to trap her by flooding the room with ether. With the Invisible Girl captured, her stepfather dressed Alicia up to look like her and sent her with the Thing to the Baxter Building. But when the Thing attacked his teammates, the rest of the Fantastic Four lured him into a serum that Mister Fantastic had designed to return him to his human self, which broke the Puppet Master’s control. Alicia ran to Ben, and felt his face, but though it radiated the same strength and kindness he did as the Thing, she was relieved when he quickly transformed back into his, tragic and sensitive, rocky self.Alicia was left alone in their apartment after the Fantastic Four defeated her stepfather; afraid that he would return and force her to do things she didn’t want to. He did return, and revealed to her a puppet of himself in a king’s crown and robe. He announced that he would control the world with his puppets. But she resisted him, and in a struggle she tipped over his puppet, pushing him out of a window, seemingly to his death. Her stepfather’s apparent death was short-lived, however, and soon he returned to plague the Fantastic Four, and Alicia, for many years. Alicia quickly befriended the Thing, and they soon began a romantic relationship that also lasted many years.When the Silver Surfer first led Galactus to Earth, the Surfer was struck temporarily unconscious by blow from the Thing. Alicia took care of the Surfer, who was touched by her compassion. This meeting with Alicia led the Surfer to realize the worth of the human race, and to betray Galactus in their defense. He later returned to her but their friendship didn't last long, as the Thing grew jealous and fought with him, believing the Surfer would win Alicia away from him.Alicia was later kidnapped by the Enclave in order to use her blindness and skills as a sculptress to sculpt a bust of their creation, Him, as he initially gave off too much light for a sighted person to withstand. Alicia followed Dr. Hamilton into Warlock's cell, but Warlock sensed her goodness and allowed her in while he imprisoned Hamilton in living vines. She was the first person to see Warlock emerge from the cocoon which his body had surrounded him in, and was forced to stand by while he killed Hamilton and tore apart the Beehive. But the Fantastic Four soon saved her and teleported her out with them before Warlock could transport himself, as well, destroying the Beehive and killing his creators.Over time, Alicia and Ben's relationship grew stronger, and the two considered marriage several times. However, Ben's membership in the Fantastic Four continued to put Alicia at risk and she was occasionally kidnapped or used against Ben, most notably when she mutated into a spider-monster at the hands of Hydra and she was transformed into the Egyptian bride of Nephrus. When Alicia was hospitalized after a brutal attack by Annihilus, their relationship grew troubled. Each came to the conclusion that their courtship should end, but before they could act on it, Ben was taken to the Beyonder's Battleworld and Alicia was kidnapped by Skrulls. One of the Skulls, Lyja the Lazerfirst, took Alicia's place and masqueraded as her for a long period time, starting a romance with and eventually marrying the Human Torch. When the Fantastic Four eventually rescued the real Alicia, she and Ben officially and amicably ended their romance, though they remain good friends. Her father has twice tried to manipulate their minds to reunite the pair, in Liddleville and Sunshine City, but both efforts failed.\nRecently, Alicia traveled into space with the Silver Surfer, and was given an interstellar body-suit by the alien robot Cy-phyrr 4. The suit gave her quantum sight, and the ability to see the universe’s energy patterns. She could manipulate those patterns to fly, an activate pre-existing dimensional gates. During this time along with the Surfer, she was intertwined in an elaborate plan to absorb the life essence from the Earth. The plan was set in place by the alien race known as the Mergence. Alicia was manipulated and harassed by Coroner and Tenebrae agents of the Mergence. She was eventually rescued by the Silver Surfer. She later permanently sacrificed her armor to save the lives of Mantis and several bystanders when Galactus attempted to devour the Shi'ar homeworld. During this time, Alicia and the Surfer conducted a romantic relationship, which ended when Alicia decided to remain on Earth while Surfer wanted to return to the stars. Alicia has since returned to her career as a successful sculptor.",

      "biography": "Failing at creating a robotic bride when Jocasta rejected him, the mad robot Ultron tried again. Ultron abducted Avengers member Mockingbird, his own creator Henry Pym, and Adamantium inventor Dr. Myron MacLain, hypnotizing Pym and MacLain into creating a robot bride using Mockingbird's brain patterns.  Ultron named this robot Alkhema, nicknamed War Toy. Though Alkhema lacked Mockingbird's memories, she retained aspects of her personality, including a flippant sense of humor which greatly annoyed Ultron. The couple attacked California's Sun Lakes Weapon Center, a storehouse for nuclear, chemical, and biological weaponry. The Avengers defeated the pair by magnetically attaching them to a rocket and launching them into orbit. Alkhema and Ultron soon returned, and Ultron attempted to create a catastrophic winter on Earth through simultaneous activation of volcanoes in Mexico, Washington State, and Alaska. Alkhema dissented, preferring the \"pleasure\" of killing humanity one at a time, and anonymously warned the Avengers. Alongside the mutate Raptor, the Avengers attacked the robots.  Alkhema betrayed Ultron, ensuring his defeat.Alkhema observed Ultron's plot to invade Slorenia, and created her own servants, an army of \"War Toys.\" Alkhema invaded the Quinjet-manufacturing Wakandan Design Group Plant on Long Island and battled the Avengers; captured, she informed the Avengers of Ultron's plans, though too late to save Slorenia. Freed by her War Toys, she followed the Avengers to Slorenia, where, after Ultron's defeat, she stole the engrams he had created from the Avengers' and Grim Reaper's minds. Alkhema used these to design her own civilization of robots, abandoning the first flawed generation in New York. Constructing a city beneath Egypt's Thebes, Alkhema created thousands of second-generation \"Robos\" using her collection of engrams. Alkhema also created a third generation, several thousand \"Bio-Synthezoids\" similar to Ultron's android creation the Vision. When the Avengers found the first generation, Alkhema's plans were exposed and the Avengers located her city. Unwilling to destroy an entire civilization, the Avengers were at a standoff against Alkhema until the Bio-Synthezoids began recreating Ultron.  Ultron claimed that Alkhema's plan to build a civilization had been implanted in her programming by him to ensure his rebirth. To stop Ultron, Alkhema convinced the Avenger Hawkeye (husband of the late Mockingbird) to destroy her with metal-melting Vibranium. Her apparent destruction triggered a violent self-destruct in her creations, including Ultron. At least one Bio-Synthezoid survived as Antigone, following Ultron until her deactivation; but Jocasta's consciousness later took over Antigone's body.",

After Kraven's suicide Alyosha came to New York to understand the father he barely knew. Dressed as Kraven, Alyosha confronted his Uncle Dmitri (the Chameleon). Believing his abusive half-brother had returned from the dead, the Chameleon revealed to Alyosha much about the dysfunctional Kravinoff family. Kraven's former lover, Calypso Ezili, did actually return from the dead, and she mistook Alyosha for Kraven. She seduced Alyosha, but afterwards he spurned her affections. Later, riding a bull elephant atop Manhattan's rooftops, Alyosha attacked Spider-Man, poisoning him with an hallucinogenic dart, but then set him free. While at the Kravinoff's estate, Alyosha was learning about his father from Spider-Man when Calypso returned with Kraven's tribesmen, setting the home ablaze and killing all but one animal, Gulyadkin the lion. Calypso poisoned Alyosha and Spider-Man and used her hypnotic powers to force the two to fight to the death. Spider-Man resisted and injured Calypso, while Alyosha subdued her with his lion. Despite asking for her forgiveness, Alyosha savagely killed Calypso and all the tribesmen.He was later contracted to by the Fantastic Four to help capture the enigmatic enormous canid Puppy. Next, he was hired by White Wolf, head of the, deposed Wakandan secret police, to capture the Black Panther. The Black Panther turned the battle around, nearly killing Alyosha. The Sandman later invited Alyosha to join the Sinister Six to hunt Doctor Octopus and Senator Steward Ward, host body for the alien Z'Nox. Venom (Eddie Brock), slighted at his lack of inclusion in the Sinister Six, hunted each of the team members. Refusing to be \"the hunted\", Alyosha managed to trap Venom with fire, but Venom still managed to injure Alyosha seriously before escaping.Alyosha then adopted a more relaxed personality - suave, witty, and a ladies' man. As \"Al\", he began dating a waitress and aspiring actress named Timber Hughes from an all-villain bar. Al sought to help Timber's career in Hollywood by becoming a director. Despite connections to celebrities, Al's efforts were stonewalled, facing arrogance, greed and corruption within the Hollywood elite. Being forced out of Hollywood by the powerful Rothstein brothers. Al was beaten while Timber was brutally raped. Both Al and Timber enacted vengeance, defeated another half-brother, Ned, and left Hollywood to pursue heroics in New York City. Considering his family history, and personality swings, his mental stability remains in question. After the global event called M-Day that caused most of the mutants to lose their abilities Alyosha was among the few who retained his powers.",

There he was bested by the Hulk (sent by the Leader to obtain the Machine), who tossed him into orbit. Uatu The Watcher transported Qnax back to Xantares, which had descended into chaos during his years-long journey. The Council told Qnax they had hoped the Machine could restore order to their world. When he questioned them, they branded him a heretic, and exiled him from Xantar.Further honing his skills on various worlds, Qnax (now the Amphibion) was recruited by Empress Daydra of the Sagittarians and sent alongside Torgo of Mekka and the Dark-Crawler to stop the Abomination, servant of the world-consuming Galaxy Master. Defeated, the trio were dispatched to Earth as the Hulk-Hunters to recruit the Hulk's aid. Spiteful over his past defeat, Qnax repeatedly goaded the Hulk into combat, but the Hulk bested him again, as did the Abomination. Ultimately, the Hulk defeated both the Galaxy Master and the Abomination.Eventually learning humility, Qnax returned to Earth and recruited the Hulk to obtain the Ultimate Machine, hoping to regain the Council's favor and return to his family.

      "biography": "A former steel worker at the Roxxon Oil Company, Blanche Sitznski was noticed by the executives and chosen to become a special agent in covert operations.  Having been well-adjusted to villainy as a teacher at Taskmaster's Academy, Blanche accepted the offer and was bioengineered to have various serpentine features, such as the ability to elongate her limbs, breathe underwater, and a skeletal structure laced with adamantium.  For her first mission, Roxxon president Hugh Jones sent Anaconda, along with three other snake-themed villains employed by the company called the Serpent Squad, to retrieve the mystical Serpent Crown.  Though Anaconda and her teammates Black Mamba and Death Adder were defeated by the Thing and Triton, the mission proved to be a success when the group found the Serpent Crown and Sidewinder returned it to Hugh Jones.Breaking herself, Black Mamba, and Death Adder out of prison, Anaconda and the Serpent Squad were hired to retrieve a powerful weapon known as the microscanner, which scans and disrupts various human functions.  The mission put the trio in direct conflict with Iron Man, who was able to electrocute Anaconda when she attempted to wrap her arms around his helmet and crush his skull.  However, Sidewinder soon invited Anaconda to join the Serpent Society, a criminal organization featuring snake-themed villains.  Anaconda accepted the offer, and during her initiation test, she ordered Rattler and Cobra to finish the mission while she battled Captain America, who had shown up due to an anonymous tip.  Anaconda proved to be quite an adversary for the hero, but he was eventually able to knock her unconscious with his shield.  Sidewinder immediately teleported Anaconda out of prison, which allowed Anaconda to exact her revenge on Constrictor, whom she knew had called the Avengers hotline during their mission.Anaconda also participated in the mission to assassinate MODOK, but was defeated early on when she was thrown through a glass window with a mindblast.  However, after Cottonmouth and Death Adder were able to slay the target, Anaconda carried his body to A.I.M.  Soon after, Anaconda's close friend Death Adder was murdered by the Scourge of the Underworld, and she vowed to avenge his death.  After Viper's invasion of the Serpent Society, Anaconda quickly turned on her former leader, Sidewinder.  When Diamondback brought Captain America to stop Viper, Anaconda attempted to kill Diamondback for her betrayal, but she was stabbed with an acid-tipped diamond.  Though she doesn't care much for Diamondback, she later agreed to help her on her date with Captain America, though Anaconda did not know who it was at the time.  Upon discovering Steve Roger's identity, Anaconda voted guilty at Diamondback's trial for treason.After Diamondback escaped, Anaconda and two new recruits, Puff Adder and Rock Python were sent to watch over her apartment.  It was then that Anaconda became romantically involved with Puff Adder.  After the majority of the Serpent Society had been taken into custody, Anaconda crashed her Serpent Saucer directly into Diamondback's apartment, severely injuring Black Mamba and Asp.  During the kidnap attempt, they were ambushed by MODAM, who invited Anaconda, Diamondback, Black Mamba, and Asp to join the Femizons.  They all agreed, simply because of the large amount of money they were promised.  While on the cruise ship, Anaconda stirred up trouble with the villainess Quicksand.After Superia's defeat, Anaconda returned to the Serpent Society.  She briefly fought Mister Hyde when he infiltrated the Society's base, and also Jack Flag, a double agent who feigned desire to join the organization and become King Cobra's successor.  Much later, Anaconda joined the Bloodsport competition, where she battled Forearm in the first round and Puma in the second.  During her battle with Puma, he defeated her by slashing her throat.  However, Anaconda's recuperative abilities proved useful, as she survived the encounter and joined the Serpent Society once more as they tried to prosecute Diamondback for her betrayal.  She was eventually hired by S.H.I.E.L.D. to join the new Six Pack group.  With the team, she briefly battled Cable, but turned on SHIELD when Cable promised her, Solo, and Constrictor more money than S.H.I.E.L.D. was offering.  Working with Cable, Anaconda fought the X-Men until Silver Surfer interrupted the battle.  The Six Pack later returned to find Cable, but they were absorbed into his mind.  Fortunately, they were saved by Deadpool and the Fixer. Recently, Anaconda was recruited back to Six Pack by U.S. government. They were given assignment to undermine Cable's leadership in Rumenistan. They planted several bombs under Rumenistan's capital while teams new member Deadpool, replacing Constrictor, took care of Cable. They managed to cut all power from the city, but Cable recovered and intervened using his powers to repair the relays and restored power. Six Pack was then quickly arrested and Anaconda was deported with rest of the team.",

As he matured and his mutant powers manifested, Tike's obsessive-compulsive disorder got worse, but he was able to hide it from most people. Joining the new, media-friendly X-Force as the Anarchist after the death of the popular Sluk, the abrasive Tike quickly became a fan-favorite. One of the few members to survive the Boyz R Us massacre, Anarchist sought to lead X-Force, but new member the Orphan got the job instead. After losing several members on a mission to rescue Paco Perez from Bastrona, X-Force recruited the Spike, who questioned Tike's African-American roots. Around the same time, less popular team members Phat and Vivisector began a public feud with the Anarchist, hoping the added press would boost their popularity. As the animosity between Spike and Anarchist grew, X-Force was hired by the U.S. government to throw a battle in space against a group of convicts mutated into the Bush Rangers.  The C.I.A. hoped to jump in and make the save, but the mission went wrong, resulting in the deaths of Spike and U-Go Girl, X-Force's most popular member. With her dying breath, U-Go Girl offered a new team name: X-Statix.Shortly after the Bush Rangers fiasco, Tike and new team mate Dead Girl, a mutant zombie, began a controversial relationship.  They briefly left the team to tour together as the Death &amp; Anarchy Roadshow. While out with Dead Girl, Tike was arrested, but his celebrity made him nearly untouchable by the authorities. Following the Arnie Lundberg and Bad Guy scandals, the Anarchist was finally named team leader of X-Statix, replacing the Orphan, who stepped down willingly. Tike's leadership was cut short when undead media sensation Henrietta Hunter took over the team.  After X-Force helped Henrietta find peace by killing her murderers, she died again, and Tike resumed leadership. When X-Statix fought the Avengers over ownership of Doop, Anarchist held his own against Captain America.  The two teams later joined forces to fight off the Asgardian Fatal Sisters, ultimately proving that Doop belonged with X-Statix. Despite the team's success, Tike began considering a solo career, and X-Statix decided to disband after one final mission. Overpowered by what seemed like a small army, the members of X-Statix all died, save the Orphan and Tike, who made a final stand. Taking off his visor, Tike charged at the enemy gunmen, who shot him down.",

Emerging, Angel was shocked to discover she had grown fly-like wings. She was found by the U-Men, a group of humans who harvested mutant body parts to graft onto themselves.  Before they could make Angel their next unwilling donor, she was rescued by Wolverine and taken to the Xavier Institute. Angel reluctantly enrolled as a student, and was soon forced to help the Stepford Cuckoos and Beak oppose an assault by the alien Shi'ar Imperial Guard. Angel was subsequently placed in the Special Class taught by the mutant healer Xorn. Later, during a flight class, Angel accepted a dare to kiss Beak, unintentionally causing him to fall in love with her. To her own surprise, Angel began to fall for him as well, and on a school camping trip they snuck away to have an intimate encounter before they were attacked by U-Men. With Xorn's help, the U-Men were defeated, and the Class returned to the Institute in time to help quell a riot fomented by Quentin Quire. Angel subsequently told Beak she was pregnant, and laid eggs on the ceiling of a shack on the school's grounds. She was implicated in an attempt on the life of teacher Emma Frost just before her eggs hatched, but it was ultimately revealed that she had been mentally controlled by rogue Stepford Cuckoo Esme. Soon after, Xorn was coerced by an unknown party into believing he was the X-Men's nemesis Magneto, and the Special Class were convinced by Esme, one of the Stepford Cuckoos, to serve as his Brotherhood until his defeat by the X-Men. Later, Beak became unhinged from time and joined the reality-hopping Exiles team, leaving Angel and the children to believe he had abandoned them. During the Scarlet Witch's House of M|reality warp, Angel lived a life as a successful and childless plus-sized model with no memory of Beak. She was briefly possessed by the reality-altering mutant Proteus before he was forced out of her body during an encounter with the Exiles. Near death, Angel was healed by a regenerative serum the Exiles had obtained. After reality was restored, both Angel and Beak discovered they and all of their children, excepting Tito, had lost their mutant powers.",

      "biography": "Born into an extremely wealthy family, young Warren attended a prestigious East Coast boarding school where he roomed with Cameron Hodge. Warren's life changed forever the day he began sprouting wings from his shoulder blades, and he hid them under his clothes. Later, when fire struck his dormitory, Warren discovered while escaping that his wings enabled him to fly. Donning a blond wig and long nightshirt to disguise himself as an anonymous \"angel,\" Warren saved the other students. Warren soon became the costumed crime-fighting Avenging Angel and attracted the attention of Professor Xavier, who recruited him as a founding member of the heroic, mutant X-Men team. After the young telepath Jean Grey joined the X-Men, Warren was instantly attracted to her. Eventually realizing that Jean loved their teammate Cyclops, Warren stopped pursuing her. Soon after, Warren rekindled his old college flame Candy Southern and the pair became inseparable. After his father was killed by agents of the criminal Dazzler, Warren investigated and was shocked to learn that the Dazzler was his uncle Burt, who had been using his brother's company as a cover for his crimes. In the ensuing battle, Warren dropped the Dazzler from a great height and presumed him dead; but Burt survived, and plotted to marry Warren's mother Kathryn in an effort to secure the family fortune. Furthermore, Burt had arranged for Kathryn to be secretly, gradually poisoned. Warren and the X-Men foiled Burt's plan, though too late to save Kathryn.When the sentient island Krakoa captured the X-Men, Professor X assembled a new squad of X-Men to rescue them. After this, most of the original students -  including Warren - left the team. Warren inherited his family fortune and used a portion of it to fund a Los Angeles-based super-team, the Champions. Warren revealed to the general public that he was the Angel, though his connection to Xavier's school remained secret. After the Champions disbanded, Warren eventually rejoined the X-Men, but his constant clashes with Wolverine soon led him to quit. After declining the first of two invitations to join the Avengers, Angel teamed with Spider-Man, Ka-Zar and the X-Men to defeat Sauron and the Savage Land Mutates; helped the Avengers battle his rampaging ex-Champions teammate Ghost Rider (John Blaze); defeated his French counterpart Le Peregrine during the Grandmaster's Contest of Champions; and befriended the new Dazzler, mutant singer Alison Blaire, whom he romantically pursued for a time. Later, Angel joined the Defenders when that group reorganized as a more formal team under the guidance of his fellow X-Men graduate Beast. Angel served as financier of the new group, which was managed for a time by his girlfriend Candy, but they disbanded after most of its members seemingly died in battle with the Dragon of the Moon. Angel then reunited with the other original X-Men in forming X-Factor, an organization that posed as mutant hunters but secretly helped fellow mutants. Warren's old friend Hodge was employed as X-Factor's public relations manager, but he had come to hate mutants, and he secretly used X-Factor's resources to fuel anti-mutant sentiment. Soon after, Warren's status as X-Factor's secret financial backer was leaked to the media, causing great controversy. During the Marauders' massacre of the subterranean Morlocks, Warren's wings were damaged by the Marauder Harpoon. Warren was hospitalized, and Hodge tricked the doctors into needlessly amputating his wings. Unaware of his friend's manipulation, Warren named Hodge beneficiary of his assets. With Warren deeply depressed after the loss of his wings, his break-up with Candy, and the controversy surrounding X-Factor, Hodge sabotaged Warren's plane in an attempt to kill him and create the appearance of suicide. Though the world believed him dead, Warren was rescued by the eternal mutant Apocalypse, who offered to restore his wings. Desperate, Warren agreed, and through technological and genetic manipulation, which turned his skin blue, he was given razor-sharp metal wings. Warren became Apocalypse's Horseman Death, but after being tricked into believing he had killed Iceman, he was eventually able to break Apocalypse's programming. Warren then hunted down Hodge, who had kidnapped Candy. In the ensuing clash, Hodge killed Candy and Warren decapitated Hodge. Warren subsequently rejoined X-Factor as Archangel, and soon saved the life of policewoman Charlotte Jones. The two became romantically involved, helping Warren reclaim his humanity.Following an attack on the various heroic mutant teams by agents of the island nation Genosha, Warren learned that Hodge had survived, having bargained with a demon that granted him eternal life, but Hodge was ultimately defeated by the heroes. After X-Factor's members rejoined the X-Men, a mutual attraction developed between Warren and his teammate Psylocke. During this period, Warren teamed with Spider-Man, the New Warriors, the Avengers and other heroes to battle Darkling, whose Darkforce temporarily corrupted and controlled Archangel and other morally conflicted heroes before Darkling's defeat; and the mystic Doctor Druid tricked Archangel and Iceman into participating in a Secret Defenders mission that pitted them against old Champions foe Swarm, who was driven off before the duo ever learned who had manipulated them. Having inherited Hellfire Club membership from his father, Warren declined an offer from the Club's then-Black King Shinobi Shaw to join its Inner Circle as the White King. Following a savage attack by the feral mutant Sabretooth, Warren and Psylocke, who had since become lovers, left the X-Men for a short time to recuperate. During this time, Warren's metallic wings molted, revealing that his original, feathered wings had grown back underneath. Later, when Professor X disbanded the X-Men in an attempt to ferret out an alien impostor, Warren joined an ad-hoc team of X-Men to help the young mutant Mannites battle Apocalypse's latest Horseman Death. Warren then returned to the X-Men as a reservist, his responsibilities as head of Worthington Industries taking precedence. Ending his relationship with Psylocke, Warren later committed himself to the X-Men full-time, becoming team leader.After Professor X was publicly exposed as a mutant, Warren took a more public role in his business activities, speaking to the G8 summit about mutants in the world economy. When the X-Men were captured by the plant-like mutant Black Tom Cassidy, Warren's skin reverted to normal after Tom drained some of his life-force. Subsequently recovering from his injuries, Warren underwent a secondary mutation that gave his blood healing properties. When Xavier Institute student Husk uncovered corruption within Worthington Industries, she and Warren encountered the mutant werewolves the Dominant Species, whose leader, Maximus Lobo, claimed to have been the one who killed Warren's father. When Husk was severely injured by the werewolves, Warren used his newfound power to save her life, and the pair soon became romantically involved. After Cyclops became co-headmaster of the Institute, he asked Warren to establish a high-profile charity to improve mutantkind's image. Inspired by Robert A. Heinlein's story, \"The Menace from Earth,\" Warren established \"Wings over the World,\" a recreation center wherein visitors don artificial wings and fly by means of anti-gravity. Warren later also established \"Mutantes Sans Frontières,\" a global outreach organization that sends trained mutant volunteers to places where the X-Men have no official presence. Setting up office in Zanzibar, Warren and Husk became involved in an attempt by the Hellfire Club's White Queen Courtney Ross to destabilize the country by employing the mercenary Viper and the Weaponeers. Alongside the country's President - who was secretly the superhero Askari - and Genoshan reinforcements, the heroes managed to repel the invaders.Following the events of \"M-Day,\" when many of the world's mutants lost their powers, a mutant named the Ghoul began murdering fellow mutants. To help lure him into the open, Warren faked losing his powers and was interviewed by journalist Sally Floyd. When the Ghoul appeared and captured Floyd, he was opposed and defeated by the X-Men. Recently, the powers of Warren come back and during the Civil War, he returned to the X-Men.\n\nCheck out others who have used the name \"Angel\" at the Disambiguation Page.",

      "biography": "Untold millennia ago, the Tyannans, a technologically-advanced semi-humanoid/leonine species of the anti-matter universe the Negative Zone, seeded barren worlds with life spores. A freak meteor collision hurled one of their ships into the volcanic planet Arthros, where the crew released their spores before starving to death. Many generations later, one of those spores evolved into a weak insectoid creature. Significantly intelligent due to a mutation, the creature found the Tyannan starship wreckage and used a knowledge transference helmet to master the advanced Tyannan technology. This enhanced his intelligence and strength, creating a \"Cosmic Control Rod\" and body armaments. Obsessed with survival, the paranoid creature, who came to be known as Annihilus, set out to destroy any other living being he viewed as a possible threat to his existence. Annihilus used his newly acquired power to dominate other lifeforms that had arisen from the spores on Arthros, and plotted to either conquer or destroy the neighboring worlds in the Negative Zone. He transformed many prisoners via the Tyannans' Gene Transmuter into his servile Scavengers.\n\nAnnihilus first encountered the Fantastic Four&nbsp;when&nbsp;Reed,&nbsp;Thing, and&nbsp;Johnny&nbsp;entered the Negative Zone seeking anti-particles needed to treat&nbsp;Sue's cosmic ray-related pregnancy complications. Annihilus' minions captured the heroes, but they escaped, stealing his Control Rod. They returned it after siphoning off the needed anti-particles and returned to Earth. Annihilus next invaded the microverse, a dimension accessed via the energies of shrinking, sending his Insectivorid drones to conquer worlds in his name.&nbsp;Psycho-Man&nbsp;tried to control the dimensional interface leading to the microverse, but the Insectovorids, emotionless and immune to his power, overran the entire Sub-Atomica System and forced him to retreat to his worldship. Psycho-Man captured the&nbsp;Silver Surfer&nbsp;and&nbsp;Spider-Man&nbsp;to power his weapons and drive off the invaders, but the heroes escaped, leaving Annihilus and Psycho-Man to battle for control of the worldship. Annihilus' microverse invasion was presumably repelled.\n\nShortly thereafter, Dr. Doom stole Annihilus' Rod in a complex scheme to steal&nbsp;Galactus's cosmic power. Almost immediately, Annihilus captured the human&nbsp;Rick Jones, who was often stranded in the Negative Zone through a bond he shared with Kree soldier&nbsp;Captain Mar-Vell. Annihilus released Jones when the Fantastic Four retrieved his Control Rod from Dr. Doom. Later, Annihilus was challenged by Janus the Nega-Man, a research scientist and contemporary of Reed who developed a module capable of harnessing anti-matter energy, within the Negative Zone. Annihilus defeated Janus, forcing the Nega-Man to lead him to Earth, but Janus was instead seemingly killed in the exploding atmosphere where matter meets anti-matter. When Mar-Vell used Reed's technology to free Rick Jones from the Negative Zone, Annihilus nearly crossed over to Earth along with Jones, but was driven back by the&nbsp;Avengers. Jones later returned to the Negative Zone, but his ability to access the Destiny Force--a near-infinite power source inherent in all humanity--protected him from Annihilus. Sensing great power within&nbsp;Franklin Richards, Annihilus once abducted him, amplifying his powers out of control. The Four defeated Annihilus and escaped back to Earth, but Reed was forced to temporarily shut down Franklin's mind to protect Earth's solar system.\n\nWhen the&nbsp;Mad Thinker&nbsp;regained control of his \"most powerful android\", which Annihilus had previously transmuted into one of his Scavenger servants, it stole Annihilus' Control Rod, morphing into monster form. Annihilus was forced to team up with Reed, who had been stranded in the Negative Zone by the Brute (Reed Richards of the&nbsp;High Evolutionary's Counter-Earth), to foil the Mad Thinker's plan to conquer both the Negative Zone and Earth. The monster android was ultimately defeated, and Annihilus regained his Rod. Annihilus next forged the first of many uneasy alliances with&nbsp;Blastaar, another Negative Zone warlord who ruled the planet Baluur. When his monarchy was overthrown, Blastaar offered to serve Annihilus in exchange for assistance in regaining control of Baluur. Although Annihilus viewed Blastaar as emotional and weak, he agreed to Blastaar's proposal, secretly planning to betray his newfound ally.\n\nAnnihilus showed Blastaar his new weapon, the&nbsp;Super-Adaptoid-a powerful Advanced Idea Mechanics android which Annihilus \"found\" and reprogrammed, but when Nyglar, Blastaar's mate, grew suspicious of Annihilus and sent out a distress signal, the Thing and Avengers responded and defeated the villains. Annihilus slew Nyglar, after which Blastaar stole the Control Rod and left Annihilus to weaken and deteriorate rapidly. Dying and desperate, Annihilus slipped through the portal to Earth while the Fantastic Four were in the Negative Zone. Taking Franklin and&nbsp;Alicia Masters&nbsp;hostage, he attempted to merge the Earth universe with the Negative Zone, nearly destroying both in the process. Narrowly surviving the ensuing conflict, Annihilus eventually regained his Control Rod with the unwitting aid of Blastaar.\n\nAnnihilus next attacked the dimension of Asgard, home of the&nbsp;Norse Gods, which had partially drifted into the Negative Zone for a time after the Rainbow Bridge was shattered. Annihilus slew several of Asgard's elite guard, the Crimson Hawks, and even defeated the mighty&nbsp;Thorbefore finally falling in battle to&nbsp;Odin, King of Asgard. Later, when Odin entered a week-long \"Odinsleep\" to renew his godly energies, Annihilus kidnapped his dormant body and transported it to the Negative Zone. Annihilus was soon located by the god&nbsp;Heimdall&nbsp;and defeated by Thor, who returned Odin to Asgard. Shortly thereafter, the extra-dimensional energy vampire&nbsp;Rune&nbsp;was defeated and cast into the Negative Zone. The weakened Rune attempted to steal the Control Rod, but was defeated by Annihilus and held prisoner within a cosmic singularity until eventually escaping through a portal. After investigating a strong energy pulse within the Negative Zone, Annihilus and Blastaar were imprisoned alongside the Fantastic Four by the Brute, who had enslaved the Tyannans as his personal army. Annihilus and his fellow captives eventually escaped and defeated the Brute, but Reed helped the Tyannans seal themselves off from the rest of the Negative Zone before a vengeful Annihilus and Blastaar were able to conquer them. Soon after, Annihilus and Blastaar joined forces with fellow Negative Zone warlord&nbsp;Syphonn, who created the Conqueror Wheel to access the Earth universe. During a confrontation with Adam Warlock, Annihilus and Blastaar realized that Syphonn planned to betray them-so they betrayed him first, forcing Syphonn to retreat as his Conqueror Wheel was destroyed by Warlock's allies.\n\nStranded on the Negative Zone world of Argor by a glitch in Reed's Fold Space Transceptor prototype, the Fantastic Four stowed aboard Annihilus' monstrous spacecraft, but were soon detected and fought a heated battle with Annihilus inside a cargo hold. Seizing the Control Rod, Reed combined its technology with his Fold Space Transceptor and opened an access portal that allowed the Fantastic Four to escape Annihilus' spacecraft. Later, Annihilus faced a major setback when the N-Explorers, a team funded by the Gideon Trust to explore and loot the Negative Zone, stole his Control Rod. While fighting the N-Explorers for possession of his Rod, Annihilus was decapitated and slain by Hellscout, a descendant of 17th-century Puritan setters who had been stranded in the Negative Zone for centuries. Upon Annihilus' death, his body released a pod containing a nymph-like clone possessing his memories. After his new body's maturation, Annihilus awoke from his rebirth, but found the Control Rod missing and his empire in ruins.\n\nWhen Reed planned a new superhuman prison in the Negative Zone, the Fantastic Four were assaulted by Annihilus, who believed they had stolen his Control Rod. After a brief skirmish, the Fantastic Four subdued him, only to be attacked by a second Annihilus who had apparently also been spawned upon the death of his predecessor. Each believing himself to be the true Annihilus and the other the thief, the two Annihilus fought each other, allowing the Fantastic Four to escape.\n\nMost recently, Annihilus learned that our positive-matter universe was gradually expanding into his anti-matter Negative Zone. Seeking to take back what he believed was rightfully his, Annihilus led a majority of his Annihilation Wave fleet through the Crunch, the energy surge that separates the positive-matter universe from its anti-matter counterpart, leaving behind only a small number of units to maintain control of his Negative Zone empire. As his armada laid waste to the Skrull Empire, Annihilus himself seemingly killed the hero&nbsp;Quasar&nbsp;and acquired his Quantum Bands while searching for a way to harness the Power Cosmic.",

      "biography": "The life of the youth who became the Anti-Cap changed forever at age 13, when his girlfriend was killed in an attack on the U.S., instilling in him a deep hatred of terrorism. Five years later, his application to the navy was rejected.  He was instead selected by Admiral Jimmy Westbrook for an Office of Naval Intelligence (O.N.I.) program to create an enhanced operative. After six months of failure, he underwent Protocol Six, whereby a device grafted to his spine regulated his reflexes and reactions, stimulating his muscles and accelerating his recovery from injury.  The device further controlled a \"super-steroid,\" acetovaxidol (AVX), which enabled his body to adjust to the changes. As an O.N.I. operative, the youth spent the next year and a half performing covert operations in the Middle East.  He eventually went rogue for reasons unrevealed.At O.N.I.'s request, S.H.I.E.L.D. leaked word of O.N.I.'s involvement with the Rivas drug cartel in a bio-weapons project. Reporter Leila Taylor investigated the rumor and attempted to smuggle out a sample of O.N.I.'s research, a virus based on the DNA of the telepathic madman MODOK, only to be arrested by U.S. forces in Cuba. Taylor's friend, the vigilante Falcon (Sam Wilson), broke her out of prison, prompting O.N.I.'s rogue operative to emerge from hiding to pursue them.  This was just as S.H.I.E.L.D. had intended. The operative, dressed in Captain America's uniform and dubbed \"the Anti-Cap,\" confronted the hero at the Rivas estate and killed druglord Manuel Rivas.  He then flew with both Falcon and Taylor to the U.S., only for them to escape when the plane crashed. The Anti-Cap tracked them again but was captured by the true Captain America after an excruciating battle.Concerned that O.N.I. might execute its wayward operative, Captain America kept the Anti-Cap in hiding, only for him to apparently die from AVX withdrawal. Buried at sea, he was in fact only comatose thanks to a paralytic enzyme smuggled to him by the Falcon, who rescued the Anti-Cap and put him to work on private agendas. However, both men were attacked by MODOK himself, in possession of Rivas's brother Damocles Rivas.  When the conflict was over, the Anti-Cap escaped to pursue his own demons, murdering the royal family of Baud Olan for their nation's aid to terrorists. Pursuing him to France, Captain America again fought his imitator. Preferring death to capture, the defeated Anti-Cap let himself get hit by a train.",

      "biography": "The woman named \"Rosa\" by the Mexicans was the daughter of a white woman captured by Apaches during a raid in the American southwest of the 1860s. Her mother died shortly after her birth, and her father and his band were killed by pony soldiers when she was six. Rosa was sent to live with a white family, but knew in her heart that she was Apache; she eventually escaped and returned to her people. Although she was accepted by the Apache, she felt the need to prove herself, and would dress as a man to steal ponies. Rosa once tried to steal ponies under the protection of Dazii, a.k.a. the Apache Kid. Dazii was also half-white, half-Apache, and had adopted the white name of Aloysius Kare, a scout for Fort Madison. Dazii foiled Rosa's theft and let her go, but she stole the ponies on a later attempt. Dazii tracked her down, and the two fell in love in the course of the encounter. They were married and given a blessing at their union by Goyathlay (Mexican name: Geronimo).However, the Apaches were in danger of losing their lifestyle as white settlers continued to take their lands. Rosa chose to fight back alongside Goyathlay, while Dazii did not, believing that whites and Natives had to learn how to coexist peacefully. Dazii  fought alongside the Rawhide Kid on behalf of the Colorado and Texas Line against the Santa Fe &amp; Pacific railroads in the \"railroad wars.\" When Goyathlay was due to surrender to American authorities in 1886, Dazii learned that Billy Tyler, son of the Santa Fe &amp; Pacific railroad owner William Tyler, intended to have Goyathlay killed. Dazii sent Rosa to warn Goyathlay, and Billy Tyler was imprisoned.Upon his release, Billy had Dazii killed. Rosa, who had not surrendered with Goyathlay, assumed the Apache Kid alias to hunt the killers. The Rawhide Kid heard of Dazii's death and aided Rosa against Billy, whom she killed. The elder Tyler hired Colonel Richard Trask to hunt Rosa and the Rawhide Kid, but the two evaded capture. Rosa eventually met up with Lozen, one of Goyathlay's surrendered warriors, and she requested that Rosa prevent a number of Apache children from being taken away by train to be reeducated by the whites. Rosa and the Rawhide Kid had the children brought to a train under their control, and when Trask pursued them in another train, the Rawhide Kid left Rosa to halt Trask's pursuit. He directed Rosa to bring the children to the town of Wonderment, Montana, which was populated mainly by ex-slaves. and was friendly to Natives.",

When En Sabah Nur was an adult, he was captured with his nomadic clan and forced into slave labor under the Grand Vizier Ozymandias. He quickly became a rebel and was even killed by agents of Ozymandias, only to be revived soon after due to his mutant powers. Believing himself \"strong\" and blessed, En Sabah Nur discovered Rama Tut’s technology underneath Egypt, and soon destroyed the Egyptian rulers around him and twisted Ozymandias into the being he is today.Apparently, Apocalypse would use Rama Tut’s technology to \"regenerate\" for long periods of time, becoming more and more powerful when awakening. He was also known to have traveled around the world during these ancient years, appearing to various primitive cultures as their death god. At some point, when traveling through Mongolia, Apocalypse encountered a spaceship abandoned by the planet-judging aliens, the Celestials. His travels then became fueled by a single-minded purpose-- to find the key that would unlock the secrets to this alien technology. He found it in the person of Nathan Summers, then wandering various eras as the Traveler. The two fought, and although Apocalypse was nearly killed, he was saved by Ozymandias and taken to the Celestial ship. Apocalypse’s blood had become infected with Summers’ techno-organic virus during the battle, and the infection allowed Apocalypse to not only transform into an even more powerful being, but to also interface with the Celestial ship, claiming it as his own.Another reawakening occurred during the 12th century Crusades. Apocalypse's regeneration chamber was thought to be a temple of great power, and was sought out by the Black Knight and his friend Bennet du Paris, whom Apocalypse recognized as a mutant, and created him into the being known as Exodus.Later, Apocalypse surfaced in late 19th-century England, about the same time Darwin was proposing his \"survival of the fittest\" theories. Apocalypse, searching for underlings, met the scientist Nathaniel Essex, whose own desire for scientific knowledge led him to foresee the abundance of mutants that would occur in modern times. Apocalypse earned the allegiance of Essex, turning him into the being now known as Mister Sinister, but was soon defeated by the time-lost mutants, Cyclops and Phoenix.In recent years, Apocalypse was somehow awakened by the arrival of Cyclops’ son from the future, Cable. Apocalypse made another move against Cyclops and his team, X-Factor, by pitting them against a team of his own creation, the Alliance of Evil. Although he never used his Alliance again, Apocalypse soon formed the Horsemen of Apocalypse to plague humankind, when his ideas to \"cull\" humanity in order for the rise of mutant supremacy were beginning. He fought X-Factor again, and even captured their member Angel to turn into his Horseman of Death, although he defected, to be later replaced by X-Factor's ally, Caliban. Later, Apocalypse infected Cyclops' son, Nathan (who would become Cable) with the techno-organic virus (which would also inadvertently create Cable’s counterpart, Stryfe, as well as ensure his own infection when he met Cable as the Traveler) but was defeated by X-Factor in final battle.Apocalypse abandoned his Horsemen in favor of his Riders of the Storm (a.k.a. the Dark Riders) and later became the target of time-traveling Stryfe, who, as a clone of Nathan, was raised by Apocalypse in a horrific alternate future in which Apocalypse had risen to power. Eventually, Stryfe left Apocalypse withered and dying on the surface of the moon, where he was confronted by his Dark Riders and left for dead.Later, Apocalypse tried to revive his team of Horseman, transforming the Hulk into War, until Hulk broke free and went his own way. Over time, Apocalypse managed to re-create his Horsemen, transforming recognized heroes and villains into versions of War, Pestilence, Famine, and Death, (specifically Deathbird, Caliban, the X-Men’s associate, Rory Campbell, and Wolverine.)About the same time, Apocalypse apparently encountered and agreed to lead a faction of the Skrulls, who were investigating their own race's mutations. Apocalypse led these Skrulls in finally assembling what Apocalypse called \"the Twelve,\" mutants who Apocalypse would absorb powers from, giving him god-like abilities to re-create the world in Apocalypse's image. Many of the Twelve were members of the X-Men, and the team assembled to stop Apocalyspe. In the process of absorbing all of the Twelve’s powers into himself, Cyclops was merged with Apocalypse instead of Nate Grey, whom Apocalypse preferred. Unable to cope with the influx of power due to Cyclops' involvement, Apocalypse rejected the power, escaping and abandoning his mission, although Cyclops' body was seeming killed in the process.Soon, Phoenix and Cable left the X-Men in order to focus their attention on a search for Summers, whom they believed to still be alive. They tracked Apocalypse to his birth place in Egypt, where Summers, now an amalgamation of himself and Apocalypse, fought them. Ultimately, Jean was able to physically rip Apocalypse from Summers' body using her mental powers, and Cable destroyed Apocalypse's essence with his own telepathic powers.However, Apocalypse did not die, but managed to regenerate in a tomb in Akkaba. He immediately set about creating more Horsemen, this time recruiting Gazer, Sunfire, and Polaris. Gambit had also sought Apocalypse, hoping to be a mole for the X-Men but becoming twisted by Apocalypse instead. When Apocalypse’s power once again was at his peak, he confronted the X-Men at their mansion headquarters, which had since become a camp of refugees from the events of House of M|M-Day. Despite recruiting several refugees to his cause, Apocalypse was forced to retreat by the X-Men and the Avengers. Ultimately, it was revealed that Apocalypse had never been able to use the Celestials' technology without their notice, and Apocalypse believed that they would soon exact their retribution. Apocalypse sought death as an escape route, but the Celestials appeared, resurrecting him in order to spirit him away for their judgement.",

      "biography": "During the thirteenth century, Abdul Qamar's desert nomad ancestor was chosen by Eastern magicians to fight Gog and Magog, demons summoned by Egyptian sorcerer Nephut-Sha circa 1211 B.C. After a prolonged battle, the nomad sealed the demons within a mountain tomb, losing his magical weapons there.In modern times, Qamar, while guiding archaeologist Hassan Kareem to the tomb, met the stranded Dr. Bruce Banner. Qamar and his family restored Banner's health, but Kareem, an anti-Israel fanatic, unleashed the demons. While Banner fought the demons as the Hulk, Qamar discovered his ancestor's weapons and joined the battle as the Arabian Knight, ultimately burying Gog and Magog in the tomb's rubble. When Qamar began fighting crime throughout the Middle East, crimelord Sheik Abdul Hurani had the Water Wizard pit animated crude oil warriors against Qamar. However, Water Wizard's nemesis, the Ghost Rider (John Blaze), followed Hurani, and helped Qamar defeat both the Wizard and Hurani's organization. Later, Qamar and many other superheroes were forced to participate in a contest of champions waged by the cosmic Grandmaster against Death itself. As pawns of Death, Qamar, Iron Man (Tony Stark), and the Israeli heroine Sabra were pitted against She-Hulk (Jen Walters), Captain Britain (Brian Braddock), and Defensor.  Though Qamar and Sabra disliked each other, he nonetheless aided her during combat, ultimately winning the match when he seized the prize while other players were defeated or distracted. Earth's heroes were freed at the game's conclusion. Months later, Qamar joined heroes across the world in repelling an all-out invasion by the extraterrestrial Dire Wraiths. Qamar used his magical weapons sparingly thereafter, devoting more time to his family and business. However, when a demon beset his village, he fought past a messenger from the Desert Gods, the supposed creators of his implements, to rescue his newborn son from possession and drive the demon away. Qamar became an operative of the mysterious Pantheon and infiltrated the mercenary Desert Sword, fighting U.S. operatives Freedom Force. Soon afterward, he encountered the mutated U.S. soldier Sandstorm, who abandoned his anti-Arab crusade after Qamar defeated him and protected him from hostile locals. However, Qamar clashed with his superior Achilles over Pantheon non-intervention in Eastern Europe, possibly leaving the organization. When vastly powerful mutant Humus Sapien fought the Redeemers, he inadvertently drained the life-force of 2400 people worldwide, including Qamar, who fell to his apparent death.",

      "biography": "An athletic young single mother, Julia Carpenter was drawn into a covert double life by an old college friend, federal agent Valerie Cooper, who believed Julia would be an ideal test subject for a secret government super-agent program. Reuniting with Carpenter seemingly by chance, Cooper promised her cash-strapped friend lucrative employment and manipulated Julia into undergoing a series of experimental treatments, including injections of a formula incorporating rare Amazon jungle plants and various types of spider venom, which gave Julia superhuman powers. She became an operative of the Commission on Superhuman Activities (CSA) as Spider-Woman. The CSA was based in Washington, but Julia initially moonlighted as a seemingly independent super hero in Denver. When the near-omnipotent Beyonder abducted an entire Denver suburb (including the Carpenter home) into space as part of his Secret Wars, Julia fought the Beyonder's army of villains alongside heroes such as the Avengers, the Fantastic Four, the X-Men and Spider-Man (who was so impressed by Julia that he adopted a new costume based on her outfit for a time). Arrogant, greedy and self-absorbed, Julia's ex-husband Larry had lost custody of their daughter Rachel after Julia divorced him for cheating on her; but when Julia's secret Spider-Woman career led to frequent unexplained absences on her part, Larry sued for custody of Rachel and won. Meanwhile, Julia served reluctantly with the ruthless CSA-sponsored super-team Freedom Force until they were arrested by the Avengers on false treason charges. A sympathetic Julia freed them and became a fugitive herself, though the Avengers were soon exonerated. Cooper later gave Carpenter a second chance, employing her as a solo operative supervised by unscrupulous CSA agent Mike Clemson; but after aiding the Avengers against the Pacific Overlords, Julia joined the superhero team and cut ties with the CSA. As a member of the government sponsored West Coast Avengers, Julia's criminal record was expunged and it was as an Avenger that Julia fought the criminal trio Deathweb; their powers, like hers, came from the formula of the CSA's Dr. Carter Napier. Deathweb and their employer, the Manipulator, fought Julia several times, killing her exhusband and Napier, threatening Rachel, and menacing Julia's parents, the Cornwalls, who as Amazon jungle guides had helped locate the ingredients for Napier's formula; but Julia ultimately defeated the villains, saving her daughter and parents. It was later revealed that all three members of Deathweb had been involved in the development of the Spider-Woman formula and all had been employed by Val Cooper.When the Avengers decided to close their West Coast base, Julia resigned in protest and joined several other ex-western Avengers in founding the new Force Works super-team, though it soon disbanded and Julia renewed her ties with the Avengers on an inactive basis. She was later forced to retire from superheroics after a crippling attack by a rival criminal Spider-Woman, Charlotte Witter, who drained away Carpenter's superhuman powers, as well as those of the original Spider-Woman, Charlotte Witter. In a battle with the young new Spider-Woman, Mattie Franklin, Witter lost possession of the stolen powers.Shortly after the Superhuman Registration Act was passed, Julia (who now called herself, 'Arachne') was persuaded by Tony Stark (Iron Man) to join his team. Alongside Ms.Marvel and , her mission was to train other registered super heroes to perform government-authorized security activities. As well as the standard apprehension of unregistered super heroes.Arachne was soon sent to go after the Shroud (Max Coleridge),an unregistered superhero and Julia's new boyfriend (and former paramour to the original Spider-Woman). Julia helped Coleridge escape from government soldiers and once again became a fugitive.  After sending three squads to the hospital, stealing clothes and a car, they headed to Colorado to pick up Rachel on their way to Canada.  After an ambush by Ms. Marvel and Wonder Man, Shroud was captured, but Arachne evaded the attack and went to her parents' home, where young Rachel was staying.  Following another ambush by Ms. Marvel (this time including newly registered superheroine, Araña), Arachne was captured and ripped from the arms of her daughter. Julia was incarcerated and held in chains, before being sent to the Negative Zone.  However, Julia escaped captivity during the Negative Zone prison break, and returned to Colorado in search of Rachel. A S.H.I.E.L.D. Psy-Ops team telepathically traced her to Brooklyn, where she furiously confronted Araña, demanding to know where her daughter had been taken. Due to the guilt Ms. Marvel, Wonder Man, and Araña all felt during their encounter with Arachne in Colorado, they agreed to help Julia find her parents and daughter, who by now, had gone into hiding. Going against her mother and father's wishes, CJulia took Rachel and agreed to become a member of Canada's super-team, Omega Flight, and received a full pardon for her previous crimes, thanks to the efforts of Ms. Marvel. Despite Ms. Marvel's aid in the end, Arachne made a promise that the animosity between the two women was not forgotten.",

      "biography": "The assassin-for-hire known only as Arcade has given numerous differing accounts of his past life, and as yet there is no evidence to substantiate any of these accounts.  Apparently Arcade will tell falsehoods about his past to mislead and confuse for his own amusement.  At any rate, one such account states that he was the spoiled and lazy son of a millionaire living in Beverly Hills, California.  When Arcade turned 21, his father cut off his allowance, saying that Arcade did not deserve it. In retaliation, Arcade killed his father in an explosion, and as a result inherited his father's vast wealth.In killing his father, Arcade discovered that he had both a talent and a liking for murder, and set out to become an assassin-for-hire.  Within a year, in his own view at least he became the best assassin in the United States.  However, Arcade became bored with killing by ordinary means, and so he used his inheritance to construct his first \"Murderworld\", a hidden complex of high-tech death traps designed in the style of an amusement park.Whatever the truth may be about his life up to that point, the story of his life after he began using Murderworld is clear. Arcade now kills victims for large sums of money by trapping them within Murderworld. He designs and constructs special traps within Murderworld for individual victims after studying their strengths and weaknesses.  Arcade's customary fee is one million dollars per victim, which is a token fee as his expenses incurred are often higher. To Arcade, the game itself is more important than the expense, or even the winning.Seeking new challenges, Arcade set his sights on various superhuman beings and set out to attempt to kill them. His first encounter with costumed adventurers was when he captured the arachnid hero Spider-Man and the British champion Captain Britain.  Since then, Arcade has attempted to kill the superhuman mutants known as the X-Men, the British super-team Excalibur, the diminutive Puck (Eugene Judd) of the Canadian super-team Alpha Flight, the formerly demonically-possessed John Blaze, and the X-Force strike team with his Murderworlds.Arcade originally employed two assistants, known only as Miss Locke and Mister Chambers. However, after she horribly scarred his face, Arcade killed Miss Locke.  Seeking to frame the feral X-Man Wolverine for the murder, Arcade was defeated by Wolverine, the mutant thief Gambit, and his own former ally Mastermind (Martinique Jason), the daughter of the original bearer of that name, who left Arcade in a state of delusion.This impaired state of mind was short-lived, however, and after plastic surgery to repair his scarred visage, Arcade has since returned to plague costumed adventurers such as Spider-Man and the Black Cat. Arcade was then contacted by the mercenary known as Agent X, to restore Alpine Park, which Agent X acquired from Paul Steinen as payment for his services against the Four Winds crime cartel. Recently he has developed a romantic relationship with White Rabbit.",

After the rise of Christianity in the Roman Empire, Zeus allowed the worship of the Olympians to die out, and Ares was no longer allowed to act as patron god of warriors. As a result over the ensuing centuries Ares grew increasingly dissatisfied with Zeus' rule. He has tried to conquer Olympus on several occasions sometimes in league with his uncle Pluto, god of the Olympian underworld. His half-brother Hercules has opposed his attempts at conquest almost every time sometimes with the help of his allies including Thor the Asgardian god of thunder, and the Avengers. Ares has hated Hercules since Hercules killed Ares' monstrous Stymphalian birds during Hercules' original twelve labors.Ares has fought the Avengers on numerous occasions, as well as his half-brother Hercules. Ares has also fought the Champions, the Eternal Ikaris and a variety of other denizens of Earth. Recently warriors from the East have attacked Olympus and the Olympians have sought the assistance of Ares. Ares who had retired from warfare and the life of the gods has only recently joined the battle due to the kidnapping of his son.Wanting his son to live the life of a mortal instead of under the rule of his father, Ares decided to raise his son on Earth instead of Olympus. While at work Ares was confronted by Ms. Marvel and Iron Man to register under the Civil War|Superhuman Registration Act and offered a job as an Avenger.

The Overseers were pleased with the final result, but his parents were shocked at how cold their adult son had become. Arides overheard Murius pleading with Falzon to teach their son better values in exile, but Arides betrayed them instead. The scientists got as far as the spaceport before Shatterstar slew his fleeing mother and turned his horrified father over for \"rehabilitation.\"Nine years later, Falzon objected when the Kree Science Council ordered Shatterstar to gather Earth's Inhumans for use in the upcoming War of Three Galaxies; he was ordered to be silent or die. Falzon aided the Inhuman Royal Family (Black Bolt, Medusa, Gorgon, Karnak, and Triton) in capturing Shatterstar, but soon found Shatterstar's ally Maximus in control of Attilan. When Falzon tried to convince his son of the wrongness of his actions, he was shot and seriously injured. Before Shatterstar could leave with the most powerful Inhumans, he was tricked into chasing Triton and firing into the Mirror of Eternity, which disintegrated him. The Royal Family later travelled with Falzon to find a new homeworld, but soon returned after learning of another Kree plot against them. Falzon aided the Inhumans against other Kree plots before leaving for parts unknown.Years later, Shatterstar reintegrated as an energy being and resumed his mission.

      "image": "https://terrigen-cdn-dev.marvel.com/content/prod/1x/zola.jpg",
      "biography": "The frail, dwarfish Arnim Zola was born in 1930’s Switzerland where he became the world’s leading biochemist. In his ancestral castle, Zola happened upon mysterious papers brought by his ancestors in the Crusades. These documents originated from Deviants and contained secrets of genetic engineering that far surpassed even today’s level of technology. Zola used the secrets to become the world’s first public genetic engineer, perhaps preceded only by Nathaniel Essex, Mister Sinister.  Needing funds to continue his research, Zola presented his first invention, the creation of device that would transfer someone’s essence to a cloned body, to Adolf Hitler, who agreed to become his patron. This device and partnership allowed Hitler to survive World War II as the Hate-Monger. Zola also used it on himself, not only allowing him to survive into modern times but to also replace his normally frail body with a stronger, android one.   Zola also found a patron in the Red Skull, but otherwise he kept his existence a secret, performing experiments in a hidden fortress in the jungles of Central America. Captain America, on the trail of the Red Skull, managed to find Zola’s hidden laboratories, only to be captured by the first of Zola’s intelligent creations, Primus and Doughboy. Captain America escaped, but Zola later used Doughboy and Primus to capture Captain America and the woman Donna Maria Puentes, who he wished to use for genetic experimentation. He was overthrown, however, by Primus, who fell in love with Donna Maria. Captain America used the distraction to battle Zola, a fight that destroyed Zola's castle and forced them all to flee. Zola’s continued partnership with the Red Skull led to a the creation of a Cosmic Cube, although it merely served as a containment vessel and the essence of the Hate-Monger became trapped inside at the same time S.H.I.E.L.D. stormed the site and destroyed the villain’s lair. At one point, Zola created a cloned body of Captain America for the Red Skull, which the Skull used to rejuvenate himself after his body died of old age. At some point, however, Zola severed ties with the Skull to embark on his own agenda of experimentation and villainy. Although he prefers to work alone and in secret, Zola has been known to take on others as assistants, such as he did with Edward Whelan (although Whelan would object to Zola’s use of human test subjects and became a victim himself, becoming Vermin). When working on his own, it is usually for the pure fascination of genetic research, no matter how cruel or unusual his means. One time, Zola assembled several wolf-related heroes and villains, which included John Jameson’s reversion to his Man-Wolf identity. When Captain America tracked Jameson, he was briefly captured by Zola and transformed into a wolfman himself, although he escaped and managed to destroy Zola’s schemes and rescue Jameson and the other victims. Another time, Zola purchased refugees of the city-wide rampage caused by Onslaught from the Rat Pack, and he subjected them to hideous experiments. One of his victims, Jolt, escaped to find the Thunderbolts, who returned to defeat Zola.Zola is also not above working with new patrons, such as the Secret Empire. During that alliance, the Empire used Zola to find individuals with a genetic makeup that could be transformed and made into an army of dissidents with which to take over the world. Such an individual was Charcoal, although the Empire was stumbled onto by the Thunderbolts who managed to bring down the subversive Empire.More recently, Captain America and his ally Thor (actually, Erik Masterson in the guise of Thor) tried to infiltrate one of the Red Skull's safehouses, and Zola used Doughboy to try to capture the two. Masterson used his hammer to destroy Doughboy, and Zola escaped. However, Zola re-created Doughboy to be used as his vehicle of transportation when capturing the then-ruler of Madripoor, the Viper, which brought Zola into conflict with Wolverine and Cable. The heroes battled Primus and others of Zola's creation until they were unceremoniously dropped from Doughboy and Zola, the Viper, and his creations escaped. Zola continued working with Hydra until he was in a position to kill Madame Hydra, and replace most of Hydra with his clones. He went after Stark Industries technology to improve his own, using a computer virus to trap Tony Stark's mind on the internet, and waging war against Stark Industries and S.H.I.E.L.D. Zola's clones, mostly of Happy Hogan, and 8 of Madame Hydra were eventually suppressed shortly after the S.H.I.E.L.D. Strike team destroyed Zola's Facility and his reserve bodies. Zola himself was taken into the upper atmosphere and suffocated at the hands of Iron Man, but digital copies of Zola existed after, and possibly more reserve bodies.",

One of his first tasks involved hiring the Enforcers to organize the Kingpin's Brooklyn extortion operations. Spider-Man and the Sandman tackled the gang, and left the Arranger webbed for the police. Despite this failure, he soon became the Kingpin's right hand man, handling Fisk's public relations while organizing his daily criminal activities. When the Beyonder turned an entire skyscraper into gold, the Kingpin secured millions in gold typewriters in exchange for the discreet removal of the building in order to prevent the world economy from crashing. Meanwhile, Silkworth arranged to seize the government transport ships that were dumping the building into the Puerto Rican trench, but Spider-Man foiled this operation. The Arranger returned to face increasing tension from rogue criminals the Rose and Hobgoblin. After Daredevil defeated the Kingpin, Fisk went into hiding, leaving the Arranger in charge of the organization. A massive gang war erupted. The Arranger allied himself with the Rose (Richard Fisk), Hobgoblin (Ned Leeds), and Jack O'Lantern (Jason Macendale) against the forces of Hammerhead, Silvermane, and the Blue Boys. Saved from the Punisher by Spider-Man's interference, the Arranger worked with the authorities to allow the Kingpin to return to power, ending the war while using Spider-Man as their pawn.Seeking new talent, the Arranger hired Philadelphia mobster Tombstone and the mutant Roland Rayburn, the Persuader. Silkworth had Tombstone lure the Punisher out of hiding. The Arranger and the Persuader captured the Punisher, though Tombstone was ultimately defeated by Spider-Man. The Arranger's foothold in the Kingpin's empire began to slip when he botched an assassination attempt using the Persuader-controlled Punisher against South Texan gang leaders, the werewolf Lobo Brothers, inspiring a bloody Lobo campaign against Fisk. Nearly killed by Carlos Lobo, the Arranger played on Spider-Man's sense of responsibility to enlist the hero's secret aid against the Lobos. The Lobos were defeated, but the Kingpin was not pleased with his losses.The Arranger later recruited assassin Richard von Burian (the Sniper), and arranged the reconstruction of the assassin Damage into a cyborg to stop the Punisher's interference in the Kingpin's operations. The Punisher and Wolverine finished both agents. After the Lobo war, the loss of mob territory to Hammerhead and the Chameleon, and failing to trick the Beetle into killing Spider-Man, the Arranger realized the Kingpin would not tolerate his incompetence. Desperate, he begged Spider-Man for help. The Kingpin hired British super-powered assassins Knight and Fogg to kill the Arranger. Spider-Man was too late to save Silkworth, but sought justice against his killers.",

      "biography": "During the Cold War, the U.S. government commissioned Tony Stark's father Howard to build a fail-safe weapon to be used if the communists won. Stark created Project Tomorrow, which included two highly-equipped robots, Alpha and Beta units, and a computer guidance system dubbed Mistress (based on the brain patterns of his wife, Maria.) Once the Cold War wound down, the Arsenal units were deemed too dangerous, and were stored away under what would become Avengers Mansion. Years later, the Beta unit was awakened by accident when the Titanium Man (Boris Bullski) sent a radio transmission to his ally the Unicorn (Milos Masaryk), who was being held in the Mansion at the time. Without any updated programming, this Arsenal robot believed the Avengers to be communists who had taken over New York. Defeating the heroes and the Unicorn, Arsenal was only stopped when Iron Man damaged the robot's circuitry. The Beta unit Arsenal retreated to its hidden chamber below the Mansion, biding its time for another assault.  Mistress sent the repaired Beta Unit back to the surface to ascertain the time period. Arsenal battled and captured the Beast (Hank McCoy) and Hawkeye (Clint Barton), then overpowered the rest of the Avengers. Before Arsenal could kill any of the heroes, Iron Man convinced Mistress that the Cold War was over. With her mission obsolete, Mistress shut down. The Arsenal Beta unit apparently destroyed itself as well, but, in actuality, it had gone back into hiding. Months later, a confused and damaged Beta unit re-emerged and sought to re-establish its connection to Mistress. The robot fought the She-Hulk (Jen Walters) and her cousin, the visiting Hulk (Bruce Banner), who shattered it.Eventually, Senator Zimmer informed Iron Man that there was another Arsenal robot, the Alpha unit, held in stasis below the Mansion. Iron Man was sent to find and dismantle it, but his fellow Avengers unwittingly activated it by interrupting a radio decoding transmission from Zimmer to Iron Man. As with the other unit, the Alpha Arsenal easily withstood the heroes' assault. Iron Man called in Warbird and a team of Homeland Security officers, but they were still no match for the robot. Iron Man finally realized that the Arsenal Alpha unit had only reawakened when his radio frequency was disrupted. The armored Avenger kept Arsenal preoccupied while Warbird found and destroyed the radio jammer that caused its revival. Once again receiving the programmed signal, Arsenal shut down. Homeland Security took command of the situation and dismantled the robot.",

      "biography": "Victoria Murdock was the sister of “Killer” Murdock, a racketeer, and used her brother’s connections to begin a career as a criminal scientist.  She provided herself and her accomplices with asbestos-lined clothing to protect them from fire, then set fires to hold back the police while they robbed banks. Wanting to exploit her asbestos gimmick even further, the Asbestos Lady looked up Fred and Nora Raymond, a pair of leading asbestos scientists, intending to force them into assisting her. The android hero of the ‘40s, the Human Torch, came to the couple’s rescue, and rounded up the Asbestos Lady’s gang while she escaped.Determined to make the Raymonds pay, the Asbestos Lady spied on them, and when the couple left town on a train, she placed a tree trunk ahead on the tracks, derailing the train and killing them both. However, the Raymonds’ son Thomas survived, and joined a circus where he became Toro, the Fire-Eating Boy. Hearing of his act on the news, the Asbestos Lady decided to kidnap him. Expecting the Human Torch to appear again, she and her gang drove a truck full of water towards the circus and pretended to spin out of control when they saw the Torch. When the hero came to assist them, they hosed him with water and threw him in the tank. However, the Torch generated so much heat within the tank that the steam burst the truck open, and he melted the Asbestos Lady’s feet to the asphalt road to keep her from escaping.The Asbestos Lady continued in her career, and in the midst of one crime was captured by the Black Marvel. She eventually was approached by a collection of businessmen who feared the coming of superheroes, and they funded her to continue on as the Human Torch’s chief adversary. When her brother was captured by the Torch and Toro and was ultimately executed, she attempted to take his place in racketeering, taking control of his gang and assuming possession of a disintegrator gun he had found in Germany. She tried to kill the Torch and Toro with the gun, but the Torch melted it, and she barely escaped them. In her next plot, she had her gang trap the fiery duo and throw them into a lake, then supplied one of her men with a costume which could simulate the Human Torch’s powers, sending him on a crime spree to make the authorities think that the Torch had turned against them. However, the Torch and Toro escaped the trap at the lake, and the Torch pretended to be the Asbestos Lady’s own underling until he returned her, then knocked out his imposter.The Asbestos Lady was again imprisoned, but learned in the years that followed that she had contracted  due to her constant exposure to asbestos. Her final fate is unknown, but she is believed to have succumbed to the disease.",

      "biography": "The son  of abusive research scientist Fritz Woolcot, Alex attracted the attention of child welfare agent-turned-teacher Steven Estevez, who filed a child abuse report based on Alex’s injuries. Not long after, Alex unwittingly touched his father’s experimental incineration device, causing an energy dicharge that destroyed the equipment, compounding Fritz’s anger while secretly empowering Alex. When Estevez invited Daily Bugle reporter Joy Mercado to confront the Woolcots, Fritz punched Estevez out, and the distraught Alex’s power welled to the surface. The imminent danger attracted Spider-Man (who, as Peter Parker, had been on his way to meet Joy), but the situation defused itself when Fritz ejected the unwanted visitors. The Woolcot family moved into a new school district, on their lawyer’s advice, to escape the abuse investigation, but when a drunken Fritz attempted to take his frustrations out on his son, Alex inadvertently disintegrated his father. Alex ran away from home while his deliberately oblivious mother vacuumed up Fritz’s ashes. Defending himself from various parties with his powers, Alex was pursued by police and even agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., under rogue agent Frederick Miluv. Estevez alerted Spider-Man to Alex’s peril, but Spider-Man initially spooked Alex into attacking him. After Spider-Man protected Alex from S.H.I.E.L.D. Mandroids, the two teamed up to finish off the assault squad, but Alex was then shot and apparently killed by Miluv. Miluv had actually arranged a calculated assault on Alex, using tranquilizers combined with a few strategically placed non-lethal bullets. With Alex believed dead, S.H.I.E.L.D. collected him, and Nick Fury took him under his wing; however, Alex was left highly neurotic by his experiences, and it was decided to submerge his memories. Alex - codenamed Ashcan - was relocated to Boulder, Colorado and placed under the care of semi-retired S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Dylan Pattinson, whom  he believed to be his real father. In search of missing Gamma Bombs, renegade S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Clay Quartermain tried to hack into S.H.I.E.L.D. Central’s database through Pattinson’s relatively unguarded home. Clay’s allies, the Hulk and Rick Jones, easily overpowered Pattinson, but the Hulk’s appearance terrified Alex into unleashing his forgotten power, frying the Hulk’s face. The Hulk’s rage quickly faded upon learning about Alex’s abusive father, and his similar experiences led the two to become fast friends. His memory and power restored, Alex was left under Pattinson’s care, though he quickly told his “dad” that it was time to renegotiate his allowance.",

      "biography": "Originally an angel who joined Lucifer's rebellion against God during his war in Heaven, Asmodeus was cast out like Lucifer and others, Asmodeus degenerated into a demon and came to rule a subsection of the nether realm Hell. He also mated with fellow outcast Lilith, parenting many demonic offspring, though most were slain by agents of Heaven.In recent years, seeking to restore his waning power over humanity, Asmodeus used his Netherflame to identify the Ghost Rider as a powerful demon he could use to terrorize Earth. Asmodeus dispatched the she-witch Tabicantra to destroy the humanity within the  Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze) so Asmodeus could enslave him, but Tabicantra fell in love with Blaze and used her own life force to save him from V'Zarr-Than and Asmodeus' other demons. Asmodeus later had another demon, Rhz'arr, abducts Blaze and brings him to Asmodeus' realm where he attempted a ritual to eradicate Ghost Riders last vestiges of humanity, but Ghost Rider Broke free and attacked with hellfire, forcing Asmodeus to send Ghost Rider back to Earth. Asmodeus next gambled with fellowed Hell-Lord Mephisto for control of the Ghost Rider. The Ghost Rider demon self, Zarathos, was split from Blaze and the two ran a gauntlet of Asmodeus design to return to Earth. When Asmodeus lost the contest by failing to prevent their escape from Hell, Mephisto imposed a \"small penalty\" by incinerating Asmodeus.Years later possibly after Franklin Richards had temporarily dispersed Mephisto; Asmodeus regained power and retook his realm of Hell, awakening his minions from their slumber. To initiate his campaign of terror, Asmodeus facilitated Dracula's resurrection with the aid of human pawn Professor Gregor Smirnoff. Asmodeus aided Smirnoff in granting Dracula vast power via sacrifice of Smirnoff's cult, the Belonging.Note: Asmodeus' name and variations thereof have been used by many demons and other beings over the years, it is believed that Asmodiar, a Hell-ruling demon who sent his son, Beliar, to assault 6th century Camelot, was actually Asmodeus himself. Merlin decapitated Asmodiar using Beliar's sword, though this was a temporary setback. An extradimensional amorphous demon named Asmodeus marked twins, Angela and Joshua Farkas, children of the Enclave cult members it had saved from Nazis years before. The Enclave last summoned that Asmodeus to earth to mate with Angela, after which Joshua (now the Dimensional Man) drove Asmodeus back to its realm. The long-legged bird demon Azmodeus served as adviser and familiar to Mephistos' pawn Master Pandemonium; Mephisto may have restored the true Asmodeus and consigned him to his lowly position. This may have been Asmodeus' first step towards regaining his power and his realm.Check out others who have used the name \"Asmodeus\" at the Disambiguation Page",

      "biography": "Henrique \"Henry\" Gallante was a drug-addicted youth left abused and abandoned from his home and whose burgeoning mutant powers were driving him insane. He was placed in the Smythers drug rehabilitation clinic, but the doctors held little hope for him. Unknown to the doctors, Gallante's mutant powers allowed him access to the dimension of Darkforce, an extradimensional energy resembling tar. Although the energy possessed no true sentience, Gallante displaced his feelings of darkness and despair to it and allowed it to mimic an empathic sentience that fed off and perpetuated Gallante's dark feelings.Through Gallante, the Darkforce was able to access his dimensional plane, as its natural tendency was to fill the relative vacuum of darkness such a dimension of light created. Soon, the Darkforce began to use Gallante to allow it to seep into his world, kidnapping those who could access Darkforce, such as Cloak, Shroud, and Quagmire, and trapping them within its dimension. It also began to flood New York City and envelope those with dark or violent tendencies, unleashing that side of them. Gallante grew mad as the power of the darkness increased, and he succumbed wholeheartedly to the Darkforce, desiring to destroy the world.With an army of Darkforce-controlled individuals, Gallante, calling himself Darkling, was confronted by an assemblage of Earth's heroes, including the New Warriors, Spider-Man, and Doctor Strange. The New Warriors' Firestar and Dagger were able to use their powers to disrupt Gallante's access to the Darkforce, and the heroes were ultimately able to convince Gallante of the error of his ways. Deciding that to understand himself meant to live with his darkness, Gallante disappeared into the Darkforce dimension, taking its residual energies with him.Gallante was able to return to Earth by way of a mask once used by the villain Asylum. A gang member found the mask and donned it, overwhelmed by the perception it gave him into the darkness within the psyche of those around him. As the Darkforce exuded from the mask and consumed him, Gallante had taken his place. Taking the identity of Asylum for himself, Gallante sought out the former Asylum’s teammates, Psionex, and took on the role of their new leader. The team was determined to use their abilities to clean up New York City as their newest superhuman champions. Unfortunately, Asylum led Psionex to attack a group of supposed gang members that merely turned out to be youth playing with toy guns. Before realizing this mistake, Asylum forced a child into the Darkforce Dimension to face the darkness within him, and the boy emerged dead. Distraught that his powers would accidentally cause the death of an innocent, Gallante fled and was pursued by this teammates, who were determined to make Gallante face justice (although most were pursuing him so that they themselves would not be implicated in the charges). During their conflict, they were confronted by the New Warriors, who managed to disrupt Gallante’s connection to the Darkforce Dimension in order to capture him. They convinced him that vigilantes shouldn’t be above the law, and he needed to be accountable even for an accidental death. Asylum was remanded to the police, and Psionex was given over to its creators, the company Genetech, for custody.  Months later, Baron Zemo sought out Gallante in his mental ward, sending members of the Thunderbolts to recruit Asylum so that they could use his access to the Darkforce Dimension to rescue the Smuggler. Since the Thunderbolts support of the Civil War|Superhuman Registration Act, Asylum remained with the team.",

      "biography": "A career criminal turned wavering, would-be hero, Erik Josten has lived much of his life as a smalltime loser trying to be a big man. Growing up on his family's farm outside the small town of Madison, Wisconsin, Erik became a troubled teen that ran with a bad crowd. His kid sister Lindy idolized him, and was killed in an auto accident one night while trying to follow Erik into town on her bicycle. Blaming himself, Erik ran away from home and joined the army. He was caught smuggling and ran again, becoming a mercenary. Desperate and directionless, Erik joined the private army of infamous super-criminal Baron Zemo, whose brutal discipline restored a sense of purpose and order to Josten's life. Josten was intensely grateful, and became fiercely loyal to the Baron. When Zemo died in battle with Captain America, Josten fled to the South American jungle surrounding Zemo's headquarters, hoping to evade capture.\n\nZemo's ally, Amora the Enchantress, soon seduced Josten into serving her. Using Zemo's ionic ray machines (which had previously transformed Simon Williams into Wonder Man), she gave Josten superhuman strength and durability, dubbing him Power Man. They conspired together to destroy the Avengers, but their plot failed, and the Enchantress abandoned Josten. The embittered Power Man turned to crime, forming a long-running partnership with fellow super-mercenary the Swordsman (Jacques Duquesne). Battling the Avengers as agents of the Black Widow (Natasha Romanova), then a brainwashed communist pawn), they were defeated by Swordsman's old protégé Hawkeye. Later serving the Red Skull, the duo was defeated by Captain America. After that, Power Man and Swordsman began working in larger groups. They fought an early incarnation of Alpha Flight as members of Egghead's Emissaries of Evil, and battled the Avengers twice more as agents of the Mandarin and as founding members of the Lethal Legion, but they were defeated repeatedly. The increasingly weary and disillusioned Swordsman abandoned their partnership and eventually reformed, dying in action as a member of the Avengers. Josten, meanwhile, sank into obscurity. His powers seemed to be gradually fading, possibly because Zemo's machines had been tailored to the physiology of Simon Williams (who was far more consistently powerful as Wonder Man than Josten was as Power Man.) The public had already mostly forgotten Josten when superhuman hero-for-hire Luke Cage began using the costumed alias Power Man. Enraged by this unwitting slight, Josten challenged Cage to a grudge match for the rights to the Power Man name. Cage beat him soundly. Retreating into anonymity as a dock worker, Josten was recruited into crime lord Count Nefaria's new Lethal Legion, all of whom had their powers boosted by Nefaria's scientist Kenneth Sturdy. The boost proved temporary, and Nefaria siphoned away their energies to empower himself, resulting in the enfeebled Legion's swift defeat by the Avengers.\n\nReduced to a tiny fraction of his former power, Josten returned to his old smuggling profession, adopting a less flamboyant (and less imaginative) identity as the Smuggler. Joining the Maggia crime syndicate, the Smuggler soon headed his own small gang, but he was defeated and captured by Spider-Man. Agreeing to testify against the Maggia, he was kidnapped by Maggia enforcers but escaped with the aid of Spider-Man, who delivered a seriously injured Josten to the police. Desperate to regain his former might, Josten later sought out criminal scientist Karl Malus, who restored Josten's superhuman strength and durability while infusing Josten with Pym particles that gave him the power to grow to gigantic size. Dubbing himself Goliath, Josten set out to become a major super-criminal, promptly abandoning Malus, since he no longer wanted to be anyone's minion. During skirmishes with the new western Avengers roster, Goliath pushed his new powers beyond their limits and fell comatose.\n\nRecovering somewhat (though his mind and body remained unstable), Josten was defeated repeatedly by the Avengers, once while serving with a new Lethal Legion. Joining the Masters of Evil assembled by the new Baron Zemo (Heinrich's son Helmut), Goliath participated in their occupation of Avengers Mansion, during which he and several other Masters nearly beat Hercules to death. When the Avengers retook the Mansion, Goliath escaped, but subsequently lost several battles with Spider-Man. Imprisoned in the Vault, Josten participated in a mass escape attempt foiled by the Avengers and Freedom Force. By this time, Josten's ionic-powered counterpart Wonder Man was a successful celebrity as both an Avengers member and a Hollywood actor. Growing obsessively jealous of Williams, Josten attacked Wonder Man and was defeated. Later, acting as an agent of size-changing criminal Doctor Nemesis (Michael Stockton), Goliath was defeated by the new Giant-Man (Bill Foster). Goliath also lost a battle with the new Ant-Man (Scott Lang). When adventurer Clint Barton (best known as the archer Hawkeye) briefly resumed his own use of the Goliath identity and its growth powers, Josten fought him for the rights to the name. Barton defeated him with the aid of his wife, Mockingbird. An electrical discharge during this fight exacerbated Josten's growing mental and physical instability, attracting the attention of the extra dimensional Kosmosians, whose realm was the source of most human size-changers' powers. After battling Wonder Man again during a baffling deception staged by the demon Mephisto, Josten was abducted by criminal Kosmosians and used as an unwilling pawn in their invasion of Earth. The invasion was thwarted and Josten rescued by the original Giant-Man (Hank Pym), but Josten was left in a coma. Josten was later abducted by the Kosmosian authorities, who tortured the \"Intruder from Beyond\" for his supposed crimes until he was rescued by Helmut Zemo's latest Masters, earning Zemo Josten's fanatical loyalty.\n\nWhen the Avengers apparently died in battle with Onslaught, Zemo's new Masters filled this hero void by masquerading as a new super-team called the Thunderbolts whilst plotting world domination. His physical appearance altered by his team mate Techno (Norbert Ebersol), Josten began enjoying his new guise as the superhero Atlas, romancing the team's mayoral liaison Dallas Riordan, as well as befriending the innocent teen adventurer Jolt, whom the Thunderbolts had recruited as part of their pose. When Zemo enacted his world conquest scheme, exposing the Thunderbolts' true identities in the process, Atlas was heartbroken at losing Dallas and his new life. Josten initially remained loyal to Zemo, helping Zemo and Techno subdue the dissenting Thunderbolts. After the Baron threatened to kill Jolt, Atlas finally turned against Zemo, helping the Thunderbolts and other heroes thwart Zemo's plot. However, Atlas also secretly helped the defeated Zemo escape, trying to settle the debt he owed the Zemo family.\n\nThe remaining Thunderbolts continued operating as a heroic team in hopes of winning back public approval. Atlas, demoralized by his betrayals of Dallas and Zemo, decided he was no good to anyone and fled back to Madison, Wisconsin. Once there, Atlas learned that his super-criminal reputation had all but destroyed the Josten family; other townsfolk spurned the Jostens and refused to do business with them, driving their farm into bankruptcy. Erik's parents had died penniless and broken-hearted, his brother Carl had become a pathetic drunk, and their other brother Conrad had moved away and changed his name. Guilt-stricken, Atlas tried to protect Carl from a local loan shark, but Carl was shot and killed. Vowing never to run away from his problems and responsibilities again, Atlas rejoined the Thunderbolts, staying with them even after his old foe Hawkeye joined as the group's new leader. Atlas was suspicious and scornful of Hawkeye at first, but the archer won his respect by protecting him from a vengeful Hercules. With a good friend in Jolt and a strong leader in Hawkeye, Atlas found new purpose as a mainstay of the Thunderbolts.\n\nUnfortunately, Erik still nursed doubts about his own worthiness and about the team's chances of success, doubts that intensified after Jolt was apparently murdered by Scourge (Jack Monroe). These doubts grew even stronger after Atlas was betrayed by Man-Killer, a fellow Masters of Evil veteran whom he had befriended in hopes that she might reform. When Count Nefaria mind-controlled Wonder Man into attacking Atlas, Man-Killer abandoned Josten during the battle and fled, mocking Erik's naiveté. Defeated and abducted by Wonder Man, Atlas fell under Nefaria's mental control as well, and his ionic powers were augmented in the process. As Nefaria's pawns, Atlas and Wonder Man battled the Avengers and the Thunderbolts until they were freed from his control. Wonder Man and Atlas absorbed the energy of an ionic bomb with which Nefaria had hoped to mutate the entire world. Nefaria's plan was thwarted, but Erik's body was critically overcharged by the surplus ionic energy. Atlas lay in stasis while the Thunderbolts tried to cure his condition. During an attack on their Mount Charteris headquarters by Scourge, a feverish Atlas burst out of his bio chamber, growing to impossibly huge size and experiencing incredible physical agony. Unable to contain his bodily energies or control his growth spurts, Atlas realized he was a danger to the populace of nearby Burton Canyon, and decided to die rather than threaten innocents. He allowed himself to explode despite the protests of his newly resurrected \"little sister\" Jolt.\n\nDallas Riordan, politically disgraced by the revelation of the Thunderbolts' true identities, had lost her job in the mayor's office and become the latest Citizen V, chief field operative of the V-Battalion covert organization. As Citizen V, Riordan encountered the Thunderbolts as both an adversary and an ally until she was fired by the V-Battalion and crippled during a battle with the Crimson Cowl (Justine Hammer). Confined to a wheelchair, Riordan returned to civilian life only to find she was seemingly haunted by the ghost of Erik Josten. In reality, Josten had survived as disembodied energy and was trying to return to the physical world, drawn to Dallas because of his love for her. Riordan sought aid from the Avengers, who advised her regarding Josten's condition, but they could not fully resurrect Atlas. Instead, Erik's energies and consciousness soon inhabited the body of Dallas Riordan herself, restoring her mobility and endowing her with superhuman power whenever Erik's consciousness took over their shared form.\n\nThis new Riordan-Josten incarnation of Atlas helped the Thunderbolts oppose would-be world-conqueror Graviton, who had already slaughtered most of the government-sponsored, Thunderbolts-inspired Redeemers super-team. This included Erik's long-lost brother Conrad, trying to redeem the Josten family name as the new Smuggler. In the end, Graviton was apparently killed and the Thunderbolts, including the Riordan-Josten Atlas, were hurled to the Franklin Richards-created Counter-Earth. Since that world had been devastated by a series of disasters, the Thunderbolts began rebuilding Counter-Earth, becoming its leading heroes. In the process, Erik and Dallas grew comfortable with their new shared existence as Atlas, enjoying this unique form of intimacy. Erik became more confident and optimistic than before, buoyed by Dallas' spirit and her faith in him. Eventually, while saving Counter-Earth from an all-consuming void, the Thunderbolts were hurled back to their native Earth. During these events, Erik and Dallas were split back into two separate beings. Ironically, Erik was now a normal human, while Dallas - who had regained her full mobility - found her physical abilities enhanced to superhuman levels. Erik soon regained his growth power after their team mate, the Fixer (Ebersol), infused him with Pym particles.\n\nRenewing their old romance, Atlas and Dallas remained with the Thunderbolts after the team reorganized under the leadership of a supposedly reformed Baron Helmut Zemo. Dallas (using the costumed alias Vantage) stayed on largely to monitor the Baron. Zemo's new Thunderbolts became increasingly successful and respected, but when they created the \"Liberator\" device to impose world peace by draining \"transnormal\" energies on a global scale, the Avengers attacked them, fearing the Thunderbolts would abuse their new power. The battle sparked a good deal of in-fighting among the Thunderbolts themselves, and a crazed Moonstone injured Vantage. Atlas flew into an insane rage, beating Moonstone savagely until Hawkeye (back with the Avengers) restrained him. Once the fight was over, the Thunderbolts disbanded and Atlas asked the Avengers' Hank Pym to purge the size-changing Pym particles from his system, fearing they were feeding his emotional instability. Pym agreed, and Josten was left a seemingly ordinary man again.\n\nDallas became an agent of Homeland Security, and she and Erik broke up. Lonely and seeking purpose, Josten joined MACH-IV's new Thunderbolts, serving as the team's one-man support staff. However, when the alien Captain Marvel (Genis-Vell) aided them against Fathom's Five, an overprotective Erik was irritated by Marvel's obnoxious attitude and his obvious romantic interest in MACH-IV's girlfriend, Songbird. Unobserved by his teammates and acting on instinct, a furious Josten assumed gigantic size and beat Marvel senseless, tossing him in the ocean to cover up his crime. His powers restored, Erik rejoined the Thunderbolts as Atlas; but his teammates worried about his growing emotional instability, notably a capacity for violent rage which increased dramatically when he used his powers. Investigating, Songbird discovered that Dallas was wheelchair-bound again, and that Erik had unwittingly and possibly irreversibly drawn the ionic energy out of her and back into himself. Songbird also learned of Erik's attack on Genis, who had since recovered and joined the Thunderbolts as the semi-amnesiac Photon. Later, during an extended conflict with the mind-controlling Purple Man, the Thunderbolts battled the Purple Man's pawn, a mysterious new Swordsman who sliced Atlas open, causing Josten to explode. Atlas was reduced to disembodied energy for ten days, during which the Scarlet Witch created a House of M|temporary, mutant-dominated alternate reality in which Josten was reborn as a heroic military man. This alternate reality and its version of Josten soon vanished, but Erik's memories of the experience helped give him new confidence once he finally managed to reintegrate his dispersed bodily energies. He regained physical form in time to rescue Songbird from the Purple Man's pawns and help the Thunderbolts defeat the Purple Man himself.\n\nSongbird, now team leader, told Erik what she knew about the Genis incident, but she assumed the Purple Man had mind-controlled Erik into doing it, and asked only that Erik apologize to Genis. Erik soon did so, but Genis pointed out that the Purple Man's powers are ineffective against ionic beings, and that Erik must have attacked Genis on his own. Josten admitted this was true, but Genis still forgave him and agreed to keep Erik's secret. This was partly because his own history of madness made him sympathetic to Erik's instability, and partly because he found it useful to have Erik in his debt. In the meantime, Atlas continues to serve with the Thunderbolts, who have begun working more closely with government officials. As a result, Erik has gotten amicably, albeit awkwardly, reacquainted with Dallas. She belatedly informed him of his brother Conrad's fate after learning of it through government records.",

      "biography": "For millions (if not billions) of years, a succession of beings have secured Earth-616's reality's proper place within the cosmic vortex, or Infinity Abyss. Members of various races have served this thankless, solitary task, existing in a realm outside space and time. As each reality-anchor approached death he or she transferred knowledge to his or her successor before dying. The successor assumed the mantle, taking a seat surrounded by his or her predecessors' coffins. Atlez served this role for over 2000 years, but the recent \"Destiny War\" — the conflict between the Time-Keepers, Kang, Immortus, and the Avengers —created a rift in time, resulting in Atlez approaching death just as his successor, the human girl Atleza Langunn, was born. Knowing Atleza could not be prepared using normal methods, Atlez summoned Adam Warlock, holder of the Soul Gem and a being of cosmic significance, and transmitted a tutorial that Warlock could pass on to Atleza. However, even Warlock's mind was driven mad by Atlez's message, and Warlock retreated within a cocoon in an insane asylum on the planet Degaitor, located in the Herculean spire.Running out of time, Atlez acted to restore Warlock. Atlez added a single-line, \"Adam Warlock is the key to oblivion,\" to the data stream of the nihilistic Thanosi, self-variants of the mad Titan Thanos created using a combination of sorcery, cloning, and technology designed to combat specific beings. Depleting his power reserves, Atlez caused a meteor to crash into Thanos' then-abandoned base to free one of the Thanosi. Instead, several Thanosi were freed — Armour, Mystic, Warrior, X, and Omega; designed as counterparts to Iron Man, Doctor Strange, the Imperial Guardsman Gladiator, Professor X, and Galactus — and Atlez's plans spiralled out of control as they plotted to slay Atlez and Atleza and to destroy all reality. The Thanosi caused pockets of non-existence to engulf portions of the universe, but Atleza subconsciously protected her household from this effect. The Thanosi did recover Warlock, who joined with Thanos, Pip the Troll, deadly warrior-woman Gamora, the Silver Surfer, Captain Marvel (Genis-Vell), Dr. Strange, Moondragon, and Spider-Man to protect Atleza and destroy the Thanosi. Warlock transferred Atlez's tutorial to Atleza, who accepted her cosmic role. Warlock and Gamora joined the two year old Atleza in her new realm to ease her transition and act as foster parents.",

      "biography": "Jeanne-Marie Beaubier’s parents died in a car crash when she was an infant. Separated from her twin brother Jean-Paul after he was adopted by the Martins, she was sent to Madame DuPont’s School for Girls in LaVelle, Quebec. Unhappy there, the introverted Beaubier attempted suicide at age thirteen by throwing herself off a roof; however, instead of falling to her death, she began to fly. Unaware of her true mutant nature, the deeply religious Beaubier believed that her flying was a divine miracle. The School’s headmistress, Soeur Anne, considered it blasphemy and had Beaubier severely disciplined. The resulting corporal punishment triggered a dissociative identity disorder in Beaubier, and a second, extroverted persona emerged. Beaubier secretly left the school that night, returning three days later with no memory of where she had been or what she had done. Subsequent discipline forced Beaubier to repress her second personality, and eventually she became a teacher at the school. Her second personality later returned, and while partying in Montreal she faced a pair of muggers. She super-swiftly subdued one while the other was defeated by the feral mutant Wolverine. He invited Beaubier to meet James MacDonald Hudson, who was forming a team of superhuman agents for the Canadian government’s Department H. Hudson accepted her as a recruit under the codename Aurora, and soon tracked down her brother, inviting him to join as Northstar. The siblings’ reunion surprised everyone: when the twins shook hands, they released a flash of intense light. \nAs a member of Alpha Flight, Aurora fought such opponents as the X-Men, Machine Man, the Great Beast Tundra and the ancient mystic Ranark the Ravager. Beaubier’s dual personality persisted, with each persona regarding the other as an entirely different person. As the prim and proper Jeanne-Marie, Beaubier had little memory of her activities while under the control of the uninhibited Aurora persona. Later, Aurora accompanied Northstar to visit his old mentor Belmonde, but the reunion turned to tragedy after Belmonde was killed by Ernest St. Ives (Deadly Ernest). Mistakenly believing Aurora to be Belmonde’s daughter, St. Ives kidnapped her. With the help of the enigmatic Nemesis, Northstar managed to rescue his sister and St. Ives was seemingly killed. The siblings later argued over Northstar’s mistaken assumption that Aurora had romanced St. Ives to prevent him from harming her. Shocked at her brother’s arrogance and insolence, Aurora angrily told him she never wanted to see him again. She ultimately sought to break her ties with Northstar completely, by having her teammate and then-lover Sasquatch (Walter Langkowski) alter her cellular structure to change her superhuman powers to be different from her brother’s. She could now generate brilliant light on her own, no longer requiring contact with Northstar. The experiment also rendered her mutant nature undetectable. Aurora then teamed with Sasquatch against ancient alchemist Gilded Lily, and with Northstar against terrorist Pink Pearl. Alongside Alpha Flight, Aurora battled the Great Beasts, the robotic Macro System, and Omega Flight. Ultimately reconciling their differences following the apparent death of Langkowski, the twins helped Alpha Flight oppose the rampaging Hulk in Vancouver. During the battle, they discovered that Aurora’s altered powers prevented them from touching without temporarily negating their powers. After facing the return of Deadly Ernest, Aurora battled Pestilence alongside Alpha Flight, teamed up with the Avengers to oppose Attuma’s Atlantean army, and battled Scramble, the Mixed-Up Man. During this time, she briefly flirted with her teammate Box (Roger Bochs) before cruelly rejecting him. Shortly thereafter, Northstar grew severely ill, and while Alpha Flight sought a cure, the Norse trickster god Loki appeared to Aurora and Northstar, convincing them that they were not mutants but rather the offspring of an Asgardian elf, and that Northstar was dying because he could not exist without the light that the twins had once shared. Aurora willingly expended her power to bathe Northstar in her light, curing him. She was then captured by demons and became trapped in the Asgardian netherworld, while Northstar was welcomed into Asgard by his supposed brethren. Loki was summoned before the higher gods They Who Sit Above in Shadow and berated for his actions. In attempted atonement, he transported Aurora from the netherworld to the Sainte-Anne de Beaupré monastery in Quebec, but was sent to the netherworld himself as punishment. Aurora became a nun and avoided contacting Alpha Flight until summoned by the mystic Talisman (Elizabeth Twoyoungmen) to rescue Northstar from Asgard. After returning to Earth, the twins rejoined Alpha Flight in time to oppose Llan the Sorcerer. During the battle, Northstar restored Aurora’s light, and the twins proved instrumental in Llan’s defeat. After encountering the telepathic Headlok, Aurora realized that the alteration of her cellular structure had begun to alter her powers further, and that her evolved abilities allowed her to transform into a being of pure light.Becoming a more pacifistic adventurer devoted to spiritual healing, Aurora resigned from active duty with Alpha Flight and joined the Gamma Flight support team in the psychiatric counseling unit to work on rehabilitating Alpha Flight’s incarcerated prisoners. She was later captured by Headlok, who mentally tortured her for weeks. Ultimately, Headlok’s mental tampering restored her original dual personality, allowing the Jeanne-Marie persona to resurface and defeat Headlok by expending the last of Aurora’s healing powers. During the “Infinity Crusade,” Jeanne-Marie’s religious beliefs made her a pawn of the Goddess, and her trip to the Goddess’ Paradise Omega Base revealed its existence to the heroes. Aurora regained her free will following the Goddess’ defeat. Aurora continued with Alpha Flight, battling foes such as the Hand, Wyre, the Wrecking Crew, the Hardliners and a new Omega Flight until Alpha disbanded once more. Aurora briefly romanced her former teammate Wild Child, who had joined the government-sponsored X-Factor team. When a new, more militaristic Department H arose, they deemed Aurora a threat and had her committed to a psychiatric ward. She was released by the terrorist organization the Brotherhood, led by Havok (Alex Summers), and remained with them until the group was dissolved. Aurora later reunited with the other Alpha Flight founders to investigate a new Department H, assisting its new Alpha Flight team against the latest Weapon X, carrier of the virulent bacterium Thetagen-24.Rejoining Alpha Flight, Aurora was injured in battle by the cannibalistic sorcerer Mauvais, who forced her Jeanne-Marie personality to assume control. She was subsequently admitted to the Manitoba Psychiatric Hospital for Women, but was soon liberated by Wild Child, then an agent for the subversive Weapon X Project. The Project’s Director had her damaged mind repaired and her superhuman abilities altered in exchange for her services as an agent. She rejected Wild Child’s romantic advances before embarking with him on her first mission to recapture rogue Weapon X agent Sabretooth. During the encounter, Sabretooth savagely attacked her, severely scarring her face. As her wounds healed, Aurora romanced the Project’s Director; however, his anti-mutant sentiments eventually came to the fore, and he brutally beat her. When a rogue faction took control of the Project, the Director and Madison Jeffries were forced to flee, so the Director coerced Aurora into making good their escape.",

      "biography": "Tito kept a blind eye to his drug lord father's activities, not wishing to risk losing his father's love. His father kept him shielded as well, bribing federal government officials to get him a job that would keep Tito at a distance. Tito became a government assassin; the killing didn't bother him as long he knew nothing about his victims. One Father's Day he followed orders and planted a car bomb, unwittingly killing his father for his employers. Even worse, his wife revealed herself as a government agent as well, and Tito was forced to kill her in self-defense. His eyes opened at last to the perils of ignorance, Tito used his inheritance to endow the Authority, a formidable think tank for his personal use. Learning of the world, superhumans and dark forces, Tito designed body armor and became the Authority to protect himself.The Authority continued to amass knowledge, selling intelligence to the likes of the Silver Sable.  He eventually learned of the Globe of Ultimate Knowledge, a conduit to the Ultimate Machine, containing the accumulated knowledge of the universe. The Globe had been obtained from Watcherworld (home to the cosmic Watchers) by the Hulk for the Leader, whose mind was shut down by the massive data influx. Uatu the Watcher had reclaimed the Globe, but it ended up back in the Leader's Italian base, worn by one of the Leader's formerly mindless Humanoids. The Authority tested Spider-Man's suitability for retrieving the Globe using messages that led him across the world to oppose threats such as Major Love, Doctor Zeus, ULTIMATUM, and the Asgardian Norn Stones. Convincing Spider-Man of the threat of omniscient but savage Humanoids, the Authority tricked him into retrieving the Globe. Donning it, the Authority began to escalate rapidly in knowledge and power, but knowledge spread to those around him as well, and after seeing a vision of Earth-98151, where the Authority became the master of the universe, Spider-Man tore the Globe from the Authority. Uatu, who could only reclaim the Globe if it was willingly given to him, then erased knowledge of the Globe from the minds of all involved.  Wiping the Authority's mind of all knowledge, leaving him an incoherent wreck, Uatu returned the Globe to Watcherworld.",

      "biography": "The past of the mutant known as Avalanche before he was recruited by the shape-shifting mutant terrorist Mystique into the team of superhuman operatives known as the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants is almost entirely unknown, except for the fact that he is a naturalized American citizen after having immigrated to the U.S. from Greece.  He first publicly appeared with the Brotherhood when they attempted to assassinate Senator Robert Kelly during his hearings on the alleged menace that mutants posed to humanity.  The attempt failed thanks to the intervention of the mutant team of costumed adventurers known as the X-Men.Avalanche briefly left the Brotherhood to attempt to blackmail the state of California into paying him a large sum of money to prevent him from using his mutant power to trigger a major earthquake.  Avalanche encountered the gamma-spawned behemoth known as the Hulk, and suffered serious injury when he attempted to use his power on the beast, resulting in him shattering every bone in both his arms.  He returned to the Brotherhood to recuperate, and eventually both his arms were fully healed.Mystique soon became aware of the United States government's increasing anti-mutant activity, and, tired of being hunted as outlaws, offered the services of herself and the Brotherhood to the United States government in exchange for a pardon for their crimes.  Thus the Brotherhood was renamed Freedom Force, and Avalanche and Freedom Force's other members became superhuman operatives of the United States government.  On their first official mission, they were dispatched to capture the self-styled master of magnetism, the mutant named Magneto.As a member of Freedom Force, Avalanche was involved in missions that continued to bring him into conflict with super-heroes, most notably the X-Men, X-Factor, and the Avengers.  However, after a disastrous mission in the Middle East against the Arabic super-team named Desert Sword, the government disbanded Freedom Force, and Avalanche became a free agent.Avalanche later found himself in the employ of the government once again, this time as a super-powered operative for the government-sponsored Project: Wideawake.  Working alongside his former Freedom Force teammate the Crimson Commando, Avalanche was dispatched to investigate the island home of renowned author Jonathan Chambers.  Avalanche and Commando discovered that Chambers' island was actually a \"leper colony\" for mutants suffering from Legacy Virus infection, and that Chambers himself was a mutant who was able to absorb the powers of those mutants who had come into his care to bring them comfort as the disease ravaged their bodies.  Discovering their former teammates Pyro and Blob were residents on the island as members of a new incarnation of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, led by the acrobatic mutant known as the Toad, Avalanche and Commando chose to remain with them.Avalanche was later seen with an ad-hoc band of mutants suffering from the effects of the deadly Legacy Virus.  Avalanche's former Brotherhood and Freedom Force teammate, Pyro, was amongst those infected, and Avalanche sought to help his friend find a cure.  The team sought to obtain the powerful mutagenic compound known as Isotope-E from its creator, the enigmatic scientist known as the High Evolutionary, as they mistakenly believed it to be a possible cure.  This brought the team into conflict with the mutant speedster known as Quicksilver and the team of superhumans known as the Heroes For Hire.After the Toad's Brotherhood collapsed, Mystique returned to lead the team.  Avalanche remained loyal to Mystique, helping her in an attempted second assassination of Senator Kelly.  This time, however, the Brotherhood were stopped by their former teammate Pyro, whose last act before the Legacy Virus killed him was to save Kelly's life, forcing the Senator to rethink his anti-mutant stance.Avalanche was later forcibly recruited into the paramilitary group known as the X-Corps, headed up by the former X-Man named Banshee.  Following the infiltration and subsequent betrayal of the group by Mystique, Avalanche assisted in an attack on the French capital city of Paris, himself destroying the Eiffel Tower. Recently, Exodus recruited Avalanche into a new incarnation of the Brotherhood which was defeated in an attack on the Xavier Institute, and the Brotherhood was sucked into the black hole of Shen Xorn.",

His loot bought his parents a house in Hempstead, Long Island. After a string of highly publicized defeats, the Battler was definitively beaten by Spider-Man, receiving a severe left eye injury in the process. Charged with a laundry list of criminal offenses, Broughton sold the Hempstead house to pay for a legal team who cut his prison sentence down to 3 years. While imprisoned, Broughton changed his surname to \"Axum\" to reflect his African heritage. The outside world did not stand still while Daniel was locked away: his father died and his estranged girlfriend, Gina, gave birth to their son, Benny. Even after his release, Axum's life was still miserable. Renting a modest apartment in Hoboken, New Jersey, where he lived with his mother, Axum was hired as a construction worker by Griswold Construction through an early release program. Axum was granted unsupervised visits with Benny, but with little money to his name, he had difficulty making timely rent and child support payments. In addition, Axum's parole officer, Mr. Eales, constantly threatened to report him for minor parole violations. As such, Axum reluctantly accepted an offer from shady sports promoter Rey Trueno to join his fledgling superhuman fighting federation, the Ultimate Brawling League. In his first match, Axum defeated Armadillo (Antonio Rodriguez), and was crowned New Jersey Regional Champion. With the money he earned fighting, Axum regained his self-respect, paid his bills, and rekindled his relationship with Gina. Trained by the similarly super-powered Coach Cady, Axum embarked on a winning streak, but was constantly pressured by Treuno to quit his day job and become a full-time fighter. Axum complied and eventually fought his way to the World Champion title bout against Slag, a giant brawler from Vladivostok, Russia. After a marathon battle, Axum defeated Slag and was crowned the Ultimate Brawling World Champion.Man-Killer (Katrina van Horne), another former super-villain in the Ultimate Brawling League, soon invited Axum to join her, the assassin Delilah, and Scorpion (Mac Gargan) in attacking Spider-Man, whom Axum still blamed for scarring his face and ruining his life. Axum nearly joined their \"Spider-Man Revenge League\", but later decided not to participate after talking to Armadillo-who had been living in an alley since his defeat-and realizing that holding grudges and getting revenge wouldn't improve his life. However, Axum had a major falling out with Trueno shortly after winning the World Championship, so his future with the Ultimate Brawling League remains uncertain.",

      "biography": "Ireland's storied Cassidy clan is an ancient and noble lineage steeped in heroism, secrets, adventure, feuds and tragedy, all of which Sean Cassidy would inherit in some measure. The family's ancestral home is Cassidy Keep, a fortress-like castle in a remote, sparsely populated coastal area of County Mayo, overlooking the Atlantic Ocean from high atop the granite cliff Cassidy Crag. The Cassidy presence there predates historical records, and Cassidy Keep itself was built by Liam Cassidy over a thousand years ago to defend the Irish coast against Viking raiders. The Keep also covertly sheltered the \"Families\" (diminutive enchanted leprechauns or elves). In recent decades, the castle's Seneschal (steward), Eamon O'Donnell, has served as both caretaker of Cassidy Keep and guardian of the \"Families\". Born and raised in Cassidy Keep, Sean Cassidy had a happy boyhood there, fantasizing about fighting dragons and rescuing damsels. During adolescence, Sean discovered his mutant sonic powers but concealed them - partly because his wail spooked the superstitious elders of the community, who likened it to the ghostly banshees of Irish lore. Sean's cousin, \"Black Tom\" Cassidy, became his lifelong rival. Like Sean, Tom was secretly a mutant; Tom was a gambling man who loved to live dangerously. Tom was next in line to inherit the Cassidy estate and its modest wealth, but gambled away these rights to his cousin Sean in an ill-advised wager. Despite this setback, Tom remained a suave, charming, Oxford-educated ladies' man, often making the less cultured Sean feel like a hapless country bumpkin by comparison. As young adults, the cousins competed for the affections of Maeve Rourke, whom Sean met in Northern Ireland.  He had been hitchhiking home from a concert when he was harassed by corrupt policeman Sergeant McLanahan, who seemed keen on arresting Sean as a supposed terrorist, despite lacking evidence. A passing motorcyclist (Maeve) rescued Sean, but McLanahan chased them across the Irish border and sent their motorcycle off a cliff, forcing Sean to use his sonic scream to fly him and Maeve to safety. Sean took Maeve back to Cassidy Keep, where she adapted surprisingly quickly to her discovery of Sean's bizarre powers. She just as quickly grew fond of both Sean and his charming cousin Tom, each of whom was quite smitten with her. Maeve dated both cousins for months, apparently genuinely torn between the two, but chose Sean as her escort for the university ball. Badly injured when a vengeful McLanahan ran him off the road en route to the university, Sean sent Tom to escort Maeve in his place. Tom initially offered no explanation for Sean's absence, and the disappointed and puzzled Maeve accompanied Tom to the dance; but Tom, unable to lie to her, eventually confessed Sean's true circumstances. Touched by the gesture, Maeve called Tom her dearest friend, though her heart clearly belonged to Sean. Stepping aside gracefully, Tom later served as best man at their wedding; but losing Maeve to Sean accelerated Tom's gradual, secret descent into immoral, dangerous and increasingly criminal acts as he dabbled in mercenary work and various illegal ventures. Sean, meanwhile, graduated college with a science degree and went into law enforcement. Well over two decades ago, he became an agent of the international police organization Interpol. As a rookie agent, Cassidy failed to prevent the terrorist organization Hydra's enslavement of weapons specialist Patrick Lipton, whom Cassidy subsequently believed dead. Later, Cassidy hunted down the Russian mutant serial killer Arkady Rossovich (the future Omega Red) with the aid of Magneto and Interpol colleague Magrite Deveraux (who was slain by Rossovich).  He also teamed with fellow agent Daniel Peyer to infiltrate the offices of mob boss Almadavor until the mercenary Deadpool interfered, saving Sean's life but ruining the operation by killing Almadavor. While Sean was on a long-term deep cover assignment that kept him away from home with no contact for many months, Maeve gave birth to their baby daughter Theresa; but mother and child were soon caught in a terrorist bombing and apparently killed. Sean had not known Maeve was pregnant, and the few who knew about the newborn baby decided it was better to conceal her existence from Sean, lest it cause him further pain. Theresa secretly survived, rescued and adopted by her \"uncle\" Tom. When Sean finally returned and learned of Maeve's death, Tom considered telling his cousin the truth about Theresa; but a grief-crazed Sean lashed out at Tom, blaming him for not protecting Maeve in his absence, and accidentally gave Tom a crippling leg injury. Further embittered, Tom decided to raise Theresa himself in secret. Sean became an obsessive workaholic and, perhaps hoping distance would help ease the pain, he briefly transferred to the NYPD in New York City, where he once aided young mutant telepath Emma Frost (though she mind-wiped his memory of the incident). He soon rejoined Interpol, and encountered the mutant brawler Logan (later Wolverine) while apprehending criminals in Calgary, Alberta. After years of international assignments, Sean came home and led an undercover operation targeting his cousin, Black Tom, by now a major criminal. Tom was soon sentenced to life in prison, but Theresa remained unaware of her true parentage since Tom had long since sent her to a distant private school to shield her from his darker dealings. Apparently by now aware of Sean's mutant powers (perhaps due to an investigation of Cassidy's exploits by the Weird Happenings Organization), Interpol sent Sean back to America to infiltrate the rising mutant subversive organization Factor Three. The increasingly disenchanted Sean, still mourning Maeve, quit Interpol for good and became a freelancer, secretly dabbling in minor crimes. Ironically, this attracted the attention of Factor Three (mostly mutant criminals themselves), and their deputy leader Changeling tried to recruit Cassidy. When Sean refused, they forced him to wear a remote-controlled explosive headband which would detonate if tampered with. Thus enslaved, Cassidy (code-named Banshee) performed criminal missions for Factor Three under the supervision of their loyal agent Ogre, a gifted human machinesmith. In a bitter twist, Cassidy soon found himself on Interpol's wanted list. Banshee and Ogre were ultimately defeated by the X-Men, who freed a grateful Banshee from Factor Three's service. Cassidy later helped the X-Men bring down Factor Three and exposed its \"Mutant Master\" leader as an extraterrestrial, prompting the defeated villain to kill himself. Banshee kept a low profile thereafter, apart from escaping the anti-mutant Sentinel robots with the aid of the X-Men, and skirmishing with Captain America and the Falcon while fleeing the mutant-hunting Secret Empire. A diehard country music fan, Cassidy was in Nashville, Tennessee when Charles Xavier recruited Sean and several other mutants to form a new squad of X-Men to rescue the previous X-Men from the living island Krakoa. After the successful completion of this mission, Banshee considered leaving, since he felt too old for the mostly-youthful group, but Xavier and team leader Cyclops convinced him to stay. During an early mission, Sean saw his reckless teammate Thunderbird killed in action; though haunted by this loss, Sean soon settled comfortably into life with the X-Men. Being of similar age, he sometimes served as a confidant of sorts to Xavier; and being one of the new team's more experienced and stable members, he occasionally assumed an informal leadership role in the absence of Xavier and Cyclops. The team's foremost foe, Sean's former ally Magneto, once referred to the formidable Banshee as the only worthy opponent among the new X-Men. Sean also began a long-running romance with Xavier's silent partner, geneticist Moira MacTaggert. When Sean finally inherited his family's estate, he and the X-Men were ambushed at Cassidy Keep by a vengeful Black Tom and his new ally Juggernaut, both of whom had been paid to destroy the X-Men by Shi'ar agent Eric the Red. The X-Men defeated the villains with the aid of Cassidy Keep's leprechauns. After many more adventures with the X-Men, Banshee burned out his sonic powers while saving Japan from destruction by Moses Magnum. He continued to assist the X-Men as best he could, notably aiding them against Moira's murderous mutant son, Proteus. Realizing his injuries might be permanent and knowing Moira needed him, Sean retired from the X-Men and moved into Moira's Muir Island research complex, where he convinced a grieving Moira to abandon plans to resurrect her monstrous son. Cassidy lived a mostly quiet life for the next several years, though his lack of super-powers did not stop him from joining a successful mission to rescue Moira and other X-Men associates from Murderworld. He continued to assist the X-Men on occasion in various support capacities; through them, he finally met his daughter Theresa, now the young adventurer Siryn. Her true parentage was belatedly revealed to both Sean and Theresa by Black Tom. It was a joyful discovery for both, though Sean's complete absence from Theresa's early life has occasionally made their relationship an uneasy one. A new Thunderbird, brother of the original, mistakenly blamed the X-Men for his sibling's death and kidnapped Sean to lure the X-Men into a trap. He ultimately found himself incapable of killing and relented, parting with the X-Men on civil terms. Ironically, Proudstar and Siryn would later become close friends while serving together in X-Force. When the robotic Master Mold mind-controlled Moira into creating the mutant-killing Retribution Virus, Sean was afflicted by it; however, an antidote created by Moira not only saved his life, but also restored his powers to some extent, and he helped Cyclops defeat Master Mold. Later, when Sean was shot during the cyborg Reavers' assault on Muir Island, the Morlock Healer healed Sean's wound, also restoring his powers to their peak. After helping repel the Reavers alongside a makeshift roster of substitute X-Men, Banshee teamed with Forge to search the world for the core X-Men roster, which were missing and mistakenly presumed dead. During this period, the Irish government's new super-agents, the Kinsmen, came to Cassidy Keep to recruit Banshee into their ranks and force him to submit to a long-overdue debriefing; but Siryn single-handedly sent the unfriendly visitors packing. Thanks in part to Forge and Banshee, the X-Men gradually reassembled. Sean rejoined the group, notably helping liberate Muir Island and its inhabitants from the Shadow King. Sidelined by a broken jaw, Banshee sought out a distraught Moira, who was coping with guilt over her long-ago genetic alterations of Magneto. After a healed Sean rejoined the team, becoming concerned about the welfare of largely unsupervised junior member Jubilee, he helped secure treatment for a mutating Black Tom, aided Deadpool in dodging the vendetta of vindictive Interpol agent Daniel Peyer, and learned of Patrick Lipton's survival just in time to attend Lipton's deathbed. Banshee soon teamed with Jubilee, Emma Frost and a reluctant Sabretooth to rescue a group of mutant teens from the extraterrestrial Phalanx. One of the teens, Blink, sacrificed herself to make the victory possible. The survivors, Jubilee and various other young mutants all enrolled in Xavier's new youth education program at the Massachusetts Academy, with Sean and a newly reformed Emma as co-headmasters. Cassidy and Frost worked together uneasily at first, and experienced several severe fallings-out, but gradually forged a mutually respectful working relationship and a strong bond with their students, Generation X. Family troubles would continue to haunt Sean, though - Generation X once rescued Cassidy Keep from displacement in another dimension, and Black Tom attacked the group several times over.  Banshee's lover Moira placed herself in quarantine after contracting the Legacy Virus, and she eventually died when Mystique bombed Muir Island. Sean took the news hard and began drinking heavily. This alcoholic downslide, combined with Emma's wavering morality, funding troubles, and other factors, led to the disbanding of the Generation X program. Sean retreated back to Ireland, quit drinking and channeled his grief into an obsessive new mission: creating and leading the international paramilitary mutant police force known as the X-Corps. Using funds from a forgotten Factor Three account and various criminal accounts frozen by Interpol, and basing the group in an abandoned A.I.M. (Advanced Idea Mechanics) facility stocked with highly advanced equipment, Banshee recruited various volunteer mutant adventurers (including former Generation X students) and pressed criminal mutants into X-Corps service through the mental powers of captive criminal mutant mentalist Mastermind. Designed to self-police the mutant community, the X-Corps rapidly became a respected and feared presence in Europe sanctioned by various authorities, but the X-Men voiced concerns regarding the group's sometimes questionable methods and Banshee's uncharacteristically ruthless attitude (possibly influenced by Mastermind, who was secretly undermining the group on behalf of Mystique). The X-Men's fears proved well-founded when Mystique infiltrated the group, freeing the criminal members from Banshee's control, slitting Banshee's throat, and trying to take over the Corps. The X-Men and the benevolent members of X-Corps soon halted the freed criminals' rampage, and a wounded Banshee managed to defeat Mystique with the aid of Abyss.  Unfortunately, several X-Corps members were apparently slain, the city of Paris was devastated, and Banshee was again stripped of his sonic power by his injuries. After a lengthy hospital stay, Sean went into seclusion and the remnants of his X-Corps were taken over by Xavier to form the search-and-rescue X-Corporation. Sean had barely begun to heal, both emotionally and physically, when he uncovered vital information regarding the recent disappearance of Charles Xavier. Unwilling to entrust this information to electronic communication, he flew back to America via commercial aircraft, but the X-Men's mysterious new foe Vulcan seized control of the X-Men's Blackbird jet and set it on a collision course with Sean's plane. Healed enough to fly short distances under his own power, Banshee exited the plane and could have flown to safety, but instead tried to save his fellow passengers by sonically deflecting the Blackbird. However, the injured Banshee lacked the power to accomplish this feat, and was caught between the two planes in a fiery mid-air explosion, sacrificing himself to protect innocent human lives. Recently, Banshee was revived with an alien techno organic virus.",

      "biography": "BARON MORDO\n\nBaron Karl Amadeus Mordo is an accomplished master of the mystic arts, particularly the dark arts, having trained under German mystic Viscount Krowler and the Ancient One, Earth’s Sorcerer Supreme. Despite being one of the most powerful sorcerers in the realm, the Ancient One picks another sorcerer as his chosen disciple, Doctor Stephen Strange, AKA Doctor Strange. Mordo remains as Strange’s fellow student, but his ego takes hold, and he eventually leaves to amass more power and slay both Strange and the Ancient One. Mordo works with the sorcerer-tyrant Dormammu and employees several mystics to support his feud with Strange, which continues into the modern era.\n\nDark Beginnings\n\nIn the wake of World War One, Nikolai, the first Baron of Mordo in the Transylvanian village of Varf Mandra, ordered Miarka, Queen of the Gypsies, to teach him enough magic so that he could restore his homeland to its former glory. Looking to do the same for Germany, Viscount Heinrich Krowler knew he needed more spells on his side, so he ordered his daughter, Sara, to marry Nikolai. She succeeded in her mission and gave birth to a baby by the name of Karl Amadeus Mordo shortly after. The Viscount had cast a spell of transference on the boy that would allow the grandfather to learn all of the magical secrets the boy absorbed.\n\nKarl grew up a lonely child in an old castle where his mother didn't care for him, and his father was too wrapped up in his pursuit of the dark arts. When Nikolai got too close to his own goals, Sara killed him. She took more of an interest in her son and decided to move back in with her father. Under the Viscount's tutelage, Young Karl became fascinated with the dark arts and took to them quite well. However, upon secretly hearing that they'd had his father killed, Karl swore vengeance against his mother and grandfather.\n\nJust as World War II erupted—thanks to the Viscount and his friends throwing their money and power behind Adolf Hitler—Krowler sent Karl to find the Ancient One and learn all he could from him. Incorrectly thinking he'd fooled the teacher, Mordo still worked towards killing his mother and grandfather, which he did, dedicating their suffering to the Dread One, AKA Dormammu.\n\nStrange New Worlds\n\nMordo had already begun his studies with the Ancient One when the American Doctor Stephen Strange appeared seeking a cure for his severely damaged hands. However, even before that, upon hearing that he was not the actual Chosen One, Mordo began haunting Stephen in an attempt to keep him away from the Ancient One's path.\n\nThough initially not interested in learning the ways of magic, Strange stayed on because of a storm created by the Master. Mordo did not care at first, as he had thrown himself into his studies. However, Karl considered his teacher more of a threat than anything and allied himself with Dormommu to kill the Ancient One. When Strange stumbled upon these plans, Mordo used his powers to make it so the newcomer could neither speak nor act against him. The plan backfired when Stephen decided to dedicate himself to studying magic to keep the Baron from killing their teacher, inadvertently creating his own mystical foe in the process.\n\nEventually fed up with Strange's superior grasp of the mystic arts, Mordo left the Ancient One's Himalayan refuge, an act that restarted the aging process which had been suspended during his studies. He eventually returned to Varf Mandra and became a feared ruler. While researching his family history, he discovered his father's affair with Miarka and the secret daughter she bore him, Lilia. Now a woman, Lilia had become the new Queen of the Gypsies and inherited the Book of Cagliostro, which her own daughter, also named Lilia, kept hidden.\n\nFeigning romantic interest in the second Lilia, Mordo found and stole the book. He thought he killed her in the attack and fled. Lilia would eventually return to torment him, but this pursuit gave Mordo even more dark knowledge to use against his foes.\n\nObsessed With Strange\n\nWhile Strange still studied under the Ancient One, Mordo appeared and offered him a healing elixir that would fix his hands once and for all. However, Stephen refused, solidifying him on his path to becoming the Sorcerer Supreme.\n\nIn his effort to become the most powerful black magician, he intended to kill the Ancient One by using astral projection to trick his own servant into poisoning the master. The teacher refused to convey his dark secrets to the wayward student, but Doctor Strange appeared and wound up tricking Karl’s astral form into returning to his physical body.\n\nOther schemes included trapping Strange in London and enchanting the Ancient One in the Crimson Circle of Cyttorak. However, Strange proved the better thinker and magician time after time, though Mordo always exhibited a great deal of magical power.\n\nHe crossed a line when he made a deal with Dormammu. With Dormammu’s support he managed to knock the Ancient One out, but Strange escaped with their master. To find him, Karl put out a call to his fellow evil sorcerers to track Strange down. On the run, Strange eventually faced Mordo and Dormammu—with an incredible power upgrade thanks to the Dread One—nearly succeeded in killing their shared enemy. However, Stephen teleported himself to another dimension with the last of his power.\n\nBacked by Dormammu, Mordo fought Strange to a standstill until, fed up with the Baron's inability to defeat his opponent, the Dread one cast a spell that brought all three Earthlings to him in another dimension where Dormammu fought Strange. When it looked like the human would win, Mordo blasted him in the back with a spell!\n\nInstead of pleasing his ally, though, Mordo only managed to shift Dormammu's wrath from Strange to himself. In a rage, Dormammu banished Mordo to the Dimension of Demons. While he was gone, Mordo's minions still troubled Doctor Strange. However, Strange brought Baron Mordo back to his home dimension after rescuing other victims of Dormammu. Though freed from the demon dimension, Mordo found himself jailed by The Ancient One.\n\nUpon escaping, Mordo continued to watch for his nemesis through his various agents out in the world. He found out about Strange's quest to find Eternity and attempted to stop him more than once, failing every time. However, while Strange communed with Eternity, Mordo kidnapped The Ancient One and held him captive.\n\nMenacing Partners &amp; Minions\n\nBaron Mordo led several mystics in his employ and had them stationed across the Earth. Although each of his followers possessed some affinity for magic, none was as adept as Mordo himself. Mordo’s minions included Sir Anthony Baskerville, an old ally of his grandfather who had come to Mordo in the hope of having his severed right hand restored to his body. The ranks of his followers increased after allying with Dormammu, Lord of the Dark Dimension, and include the sorcerer Demon, AKA Demonicus, his chief disciple Kaecilius, and Adria who becomes his deputy leader. Mordo often employs his minions to distract or capture his foe Doctor Strange. But even his partners against Strange, like Dormammu, prove unreliable.\n\nSchemes Throughout The Eons\n\nNot long after, Doctor Strange defeated Zom, accidentally awakening dark powers in the minds of many mystics—which allowed Mordo's escape from his prison. Enraged at his rival's recent acquisition of The Ancient One's powers, Karl attacked, ignoring Strange's pleas for help to stop the coming of The Living Tribunal. With a great deal of prodding from Strange, Mordo agreed to allow his foe to exorcise all of the evil occult energy and place it inside himself.\n\nWith all that power coursing through him, Mordo rashly attacked Strange instead of aiding him further to stop the Living Tribunal's arrival. Though Karl amassed more power by the time Doctor Strange returned, he could not stand up to his foe's power and soon found himself banished once again.\n\nBaron Mordo eventually found a way to return and even took over Doctor Strange's identity when the hero wore a mask. However, the real deal returned and bested his foe, re-dedicating himself to mastering the mystic arts once again. Mordo then jumped through time, first to Paris in the 18th century to claim the Book of Cogliostro and then to the beginning of time itself with Doctor Strange and Sise-Neg, but Karl soon had a breakdown after seeing the face of God that put him in Strange's care for a year. He remained in the Sanctum Sanctorum in silence. While Stephen met with Eternity, Mordo ran from his room and escaped, eventually arriving at the home of the Aged Genghis.\n\nMordo kept a relatively low profile for a while, but eventually returned to send Strange's one-time friend Lord Julian Phyffe against him, followed soon by Man-Thing who he had manipulated for his own purpose. Using Man-Thing ended up throwing him into interdimensional exile, but he returned in the 1940s to torment Strange with some help from Dormammu. At that point, Strange used Mordo's power to stop a Dormammu-possessed Viscount Krowler.\n\nAfter that defeat, Mordo spent years planning his next attack on Strange, which came as a complete shock to the Master of the Mystic Arts. He had gained increased power because he sold his soul to both Satannish and Mephisto. The Baron knew that they would both come to collect and that a mighty battle would ensue, so he trapped himself in a contained space with Strange's ally Sara Wolfe, essentially forcing Stephen to help him fend off the two debt collectors. Mordo hoped that, after facing both demons, he could step in and quickly finish Strange off.\n\nStrange did his best, but Satannish came for his debt, taking both Mordo and Wolfe back to his dimension. Eventually, Mephisto also appeared, and the demonic duo fell into a battle that wreaked havoc across dimensions. Ultimately, Mordo felt some humanity bubble up inside him and sent Sara Wolfe away from the danger just before Strange figured out a way to get both demons to take away from his soul.\n\nBetter To Rule In Hell\n\nSince extradimensional exile had proven so unreliable, Strange imprisoned Mordo in his Sanctum instead, but over the weeks following, Mordo slowly won the sympathy of Strange’s associate Wolfe. Not long after, during a time when Strange struggled with Dormammu, who had been deposed by Strange’s disciple Clea, Mordo managed to trick Wolfe into releasing him. He immediately imprisoned her and took control of the Sanctum Sanctorum. When the Dread One attacked the Earthly plane, Mordo fought against him, even refusing the demon's offer of working for him. The pair fought again, but when Mordo lost, he decided to take Dormammu's offer anyway, thus making him the ruler of the Earth-dimension albeit as his vassal. Secretly, however, he joined forces with Dormammu’s twin sister Umar the Unrelenting. Umar offered Dormammu a piece of the Dark Dimension to rule and then claimed the rest for herself and Mordo, who would be her consort.\n\nAfter Clea later dethroned Umar and Mordo, the Baron eventually made his way back to Earth, where he realized that he was dying. He revealed not only this truth to his longtime enemy, but also how he'd sent demons after him in the past and blocked his memories. When the two connected mentally, Mordo passed his terminal cancer on to Stephen. Around this same time, Karl's daughter Astrid took over Mordo Castle and used the dark arts to bring Strange there. While both captive, Karl wanted to atone for all the terrible things he did before dying, and does so by taking the cancer back into himself.\n\nThough he did not think he could take out his child, Mordo instead severed her soul from her body. He then died, his soul taken to the next plane by none other than the Ancient One.\n\nA Time And A Place For Everything\n\nFurther down the line, Grandmaster and The Collector decided to set up another one of their contests. Grandmaster's champion Hulk chose to fight alongside Silver Surfer, Namor and Doctor Strange while Collector selected the original Red Hulk, Baron Mordo, Terrax and Tiger Shark, all from various points in history. Strange and Mordo fought on Silver Surfer's homeworld of Zenn-La before Galactus attacked, but was returned to his own time when Red Hulk ruined their game.\n\nThe Baron returned to the present thanks to \"temporal shenanigans\" and began tormenting X-Factor's Monet St. Croix, AKA M. He managed to drain her energy bit-by-bit to fight back the cancer that still raged through his body. Powered-up, we went to fight M's associate Guido Carosella, AKA Strong Guy, but they were ambushed by Mutant Response Division soldiers who shot Karl. Guido got them both to safety where he and Monet eventually made a deal wherein she would let him feed off of her until he cured his cancer as long as he got them out of the bunker they were in since it was about to be bombed. Mordo passed out after doing exactly that and, instead of healing him, M made him think she cured him before sending the villain on his way.\n\nHe suffered another setback when Ulik broke into his castle and stole an artifact that amplified his powers, which he used while working with Diablo, High Evolutionary and Crimson Dynamo against Thor and Iron Man. Though Mordo later appeared dead in a Brazilian temple with Thor's axe lodged in him, he showed up at the Bar With No Doors. He exhibited a great deal of magical ability even though everyone else's powers had diminished when the Empirikul attacked.\n\nSoon after, he took over a family's apartment in Tribeca and showed up at the Sanctum to attack the far-less-powerful Strange. He was winning the battle but found himself without an opponent when Nightmare snatched Strange away. The whole while, he argued with Dormammu, who he had once again pledged himself to after the Dread One saved him from the Empirikul, preserving his control over magic.\n\nWhen Dormammu grew impatient, he attacked Doctor Strange directly and burned Mordo when he tried claiming Stephen's life for himself. Angered, Karl added his power to Strange's so they could send the Dread One to his enemy Shuma-Gorath. When he then tried to destroy the significantly weakened Strange, though, Mordo wound up on the wrong end of a magical rope, the other of which was attached to the Phantom Eagle's ghost plane.\n\nDuring the Secret Empire, in which a bastardized version of Captain America, Hydra Supreme, took over most of the world for Hydra, part of the villain's plan included putting a Darkforce dome around Manhattan. Mordo and HydraCap made a deal that placed the Baron in charge of the captives and set up shop in the Sanctum Sanctorum. In addition to keeping an eye on Strange, Spider-Woman, Ben Urich, and Kingpin as they amassed a magical cache, Mordo also trapped Daredevil and then went up against Luke Cage, Cloak and Iron Fist.\n\nIn the ensuing battle, Mordo became overconfident once again and, even though he had captured his opponents, he traveled too far away from the Sanctum Sanctorum. Using some classic illusionary trickery, Strange reclaimed his house and the others quickly put an end to Mordo's attempts at taking Manhattan. \n\nSometime after that, Mordo was freed and began working as an enforcer for Dormammu's race. In that capacity, he destroyed the demon Baroshtok, freed Strange's one-time apprentice Casey Kinmont, powered her up and sent her after the real Doctor Strange. Banished by Casey after Stephen helped her regain her soul, Mordo remains in the ether waiting to attack once more!",

      "biography": "Born in the late 19th century to a noble Prussian family who had relocated to Bavaria following the Franco-Prussian War, Wolfgang von Strucker became a Heidelberg fencing champion, and was disfigured by facial scars. Strucker fought for Germany during World War I, during which he first encountered the jewel \"Momentary Princess,\" which was fated to appear and disappear at regular intervals of time.  Wolfgang pursued the jewel in the decades that followed. When Adolf Hitler rose to power in Germany in 1933, Baron Strucker joined the Nazi Party, becoming infamous in the following years. In 1936 he and Geist, one of Hitler's top men, allied themselves with the Egyptian mentalist Amahl Farouk-secretly the Shadow King-in an attempt to dispute the lineage of England's royal family and install a new king who would be sympathetic to the Nazis. Their plot was thwarted by the Canadian adventurer Logan and the time-traveling members of Excalibur, Kitty Pryde and Phoenix (Rachel Summers). In 1937, Strucker was sent to the United States to assassinate Senator Fulton, but he was foiled by brigand-for-hire Dominic Fortune.As World War II began, Strucker was appointed wing commander of the Death's Head Squadron by Hitler, and, in 1941, he was sent to Madripoor to help the Hand ninja cult transform young Natasha Romanova into their master assassin, only to be defeated by Wolverine, Captain America, and Ivan Petrovitch. Later in 1941, Strucker invaded Latveria, seeking to use the Sturm-Fånger (\"Storm-Catcher\") to control cosmic energies; the device was wrecked by time-traveling members of X-Force.After the United States entered the war, the First Attack Squad of Able Company (the Howling Commandos (WWII)) became a constant thorn in the Nazis' side, and Hitler turned to Strucker, ordering him to publicly humiliate the Howlers' leader Nick Fury. Strucker challenged Fury to a duel on the island of Norsehaven, and Fury violated direct orders to meet Strucker and satisfy his pride. Before their duel with plywood swords, Strucker offered Fury a toast, and secretly drugged Fury's drink. As they fought, Strucker was surprised to find that despite his superior swordsmanship and the effects of the drug, Fury was a tenacious foe, but Fury finally succumbed to the drug's effects. Strucker had the event recorded and sent back to Germany as propaganda material to destroy Fury's reputation. Soon after, Fury encountered Strucker again while on another mission, and was determined to regain his honor. Strucker tried to drug Fury again, but Howler Dino Manelli warned Fury, who then bested Strucker in combat. Howler Dum-Dum Dugan photographed Strucker's defeat and circulated pictures, ruining the Nazis' earlier propaganda victory.Hitler demanded that Strucker capture the Howlers so they could be executed in Berlin. Strucker assembled the Blitzkrieg Squad, who could match each of the Howlers skill for skill, but the Howlers defeated them at every turn. Strucker also led the Blitzkreig Squad to England to assassinate Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery, but they were foiled by the Invaders. Strucker finally abandoned the Blitzkrieg Squad, who were later led by Colonel Klaue. While vacationing in Berlin, Strucker witnessed the Asgardian Thor's attack on the Chancellery, after which Strucker followed a bandaged man through a portal in space. Realizing he had traveled decades into the future, Strucker stole some history books about the end of World War II. He encountered the time machine's creator, Dr. Doom, who allowed him to return to the past, not believing that Strucker could win the war even with the knowledge he had obtained.Tiring of Strucker's failures, Hitler assigned him to topple the resistance in the French town of Cherbeaux, or else destroy the town. Strucker rounded up the resistance to send them to camps to avoid having to destroy the town, but the Howling Commandos derailed his train, freeing the captives. Hitler demanded that Strucker destroy the town, and Strucker set the explosives, but then came face-to-face with Fury, who had rigged an explosive powerful enough to kill Strucker. Caught in a stalemate, Strucker agreed to let the people of Cherbeaux evacuate so that he and Fury could battle again. When the evacuation was complete, Strucker and Fury fought while Cherbeaux was destroyed around them, and Fury lost Strucker in the upheaval. For allowing the evacuation of Cherbeaux, Hitler had Strucker marked for death by the Gestapo.Strucker escaped Germany because of the Red Skull, Hitler's right hand man, who foresaw Hitler's fall, and wanted an alternative power base. The Red Skull sent Strucker to Japan to form this organization, but Strucker intended to run it for himself. In Japan, Strucker joined forces with the Hand and an underground subversive movement which later became Hydra. Strucker was instrumental in Hydra's earliest raids on war plants to supply their troops, and finally confronted the Supreme Hydra, claiming that as the organization's true mastermind, he should be Hydra's leader. The Supreme Hydra refused and shot him, but Strucker had worn a bulletproof vest, and slew the Supreme Hydra, claiming his title. Strucker also slew the jonin (leader) of the Hand in single combat, severing ties with the Hand to prevent Hydra agents from being seduced by promises of the dark power of the demonic Beast of the Hand.Strucker moved Hydra's operations to a private island in the pacific, named Hydra Island. After he used an undetectable \"phantom\" submarine to assault allied and Japanese ships, Hydra Island was investigated by the allies' Captain Simon Savage and his Leatherneck Raiders, and the Japanese Samurai Squad. Captain Savage and the others managed to overcome Hydra's forces, and Strucker was forced to detonate the island. With Hydra's plans temporarily waylaid, Strucker was forced to return to Germany.To regain Hitler's favor, Strucker subjected Fury to a hallucinogenic drug in Africa, offering the formula to Hitler if it proved successful in the field. Fury was overcome by the hallucinations, but the Howlers rescued him, enabling his recovery. Ever more uncomfortable with the progress of the war, Strucker continued to operate Hydra from the shadows while pretending to be a loyal Nazi, secretly funneling Hitler's resources into his own operation. He also obtained the Dragon of Death, a powerful Japanese submarine, and made it Hydra's new mobile headquarters. Using his knowledge of the future, Strucker attempted to complete the atom bomb before the allies, sending Hydra agents to obtain the materials. Learning of this plot, the Invaders ultimately scuttled the Dragon, again delaying Strucker's plans, and during the clash Strucker lost the books he had brought from the future.In 1944, Strucker encountered the Gnobians, a benevolent race of empathic extraterrestrials who had crashed near Gruenstadt. Realizing what their technology could do for Hydra, Strucker befriended the naïve creatures and killed the population of Gruenstadt to cover his tracks. The Howlers arrived, too late to prevent the tragedy, but fatally wounded Strucker. The Gnobians healed Strucker with their powers, but they went insane from absorbing some of his hate-filled psyche in the process. Strucker fled their crashed ship, taking discs of their information to his scientists. As Germany fell in 1945, Strucker had the Nazis' two greatest superhumans Master Man and Warrior Woman placed into suspended animation in opposite sides of Berlin to await later revival. Strucker also gave the Red Skull the gas used to preserve them, and it also preserved the Skull when he was buried alive in his bunker during a battle with Captain America.Avoiding prosecution for war crimes, Baron Strucker had his scientists provide him with age-retarding serum so he could personally oversee Hydra's progress for decades to come. He and the Baroness Adelicia Von Krupp once captured the CIA's Agent Ten, who proved to be Strucker's old enemy Logan, but Logan was rescued by CIA agents Richard and Mary Parker. Needing more finances for Hydra, Strucker abducted Gabrielle Haller, who had a map leading to a fortune in lost Nazi gold hidden within her mind, but Haller was defended by her friends, the mutants Charles Xavier and Magnus, and Magnus took the gold for his own purposes.Strucker married more than once in the years that followed, resulting in a son, Werner, who resisted his father's influence, and two twins, Andrea and Andreas, mutants whose powers were altered by Hydra scientists. Strucker rebuilt Hydra Island, but concealed his role in the organization by using a front called \"THEM,\" in which he was Grand Imperator. In this role, he assigned Arnold Brown to be his Imperial Hydra, supposedly the true master of Hydra. Brown's rule of Hydra ended when he was overcome by S.H.I.E.L.D., an espionage organization led by Nick Fury and designed to thwart Hydra, and the unmasked Brown was mistakenly shot by his own men as Hydra crumbled about him. THEM also found and revived the long-lost Red Skull, but Strucker finally abandoned THEM when the scientific research arm of Hydra and another branch splintered away to become A.I.M. and the Secret Empire, respectively.Strucker continued to conceal his identity, acting as Don Antonio Caballero, Emir Ali Bey, and S.H.I.E.L.D agent John Bronson. He finally revealed himself as Hydra's true leader when he prepared to unleash the Death Spore bomb from Hydra Island.  Fury invaded the island and disguised himself as Strucker, then put a mask of his own face on Strucker's, tricking Strucker's own men into shooting him. Strucker fell into the Death Spore bomb, and was apparently destroyed.In the ensuing years, the roboticist Machinesmith built a robot duplicate of Strucker, using it to test the abilities and morality of Captain America. The robot fooled even S.H.I.E.L.D into thinking they had captured the real Strucker. Strucker also lived on in the form of several different android LMDs (Life Model Decoy) based on his mind; one was activated on Hydra Island after Strucker's death and believed itself to be the true Strucker, finally meeting its doom battling Captain America, Fury, and the one-time Howling Commandos. Another tricked Canada's Department H into selling Hydra the battlesuit worn by their hero Guardian.  The most destructive was the Deltite, an LMD Strucker had planted within S.H.I.E.L.D to tear the organization apart, and ultimately wound up running S.H.I.E.L.D and Hydra simultaneously, playing the two against each other. By the time the Deltite was finally revealed and destroyed, it had managed to sow distrust throughout S.H.I.E.L.D, and killed many agents, leading Fury to disband the organization.Hydra suffered without Strucker's leadership, and the Red Skull championed an effort to bring the Baron back, providing a distraction to occupy Fury's newly-rebuilt S.H.I.E.L.D while Hydra scientists found Strucker's body and sacrificed their lives to revive him with the Death Spore bonded to his form. Strucker was appalled at what his once-feared organization had become, and began eliminating Hydra's weak, taking notice of one Cassandra Romulus along the way and making her his lover and lieutenant. To prove themselves to the world, Strucker had an LMD explode S.H.I.E.L.D Central, killing 1,500 graduating agents.Determined to bring down Hydra, Fury was unaware of Strucker's resurrection. Strucker next allowed genetically-altered experiments Sathan, Guillotine and Lt. Romulus to escape, and sent the Hydra bounty hunters Ron Takimoto, Dakini and Carl Striklan to capture them. Fury, Daredevil, the Punisher, and Captain America became involved in the hunt, and ultimately Sathan, Takimoto, Dakini were killed, Striklan went rogue, and only Guillotine &amp; Romulus returned to Hydra. Strucker had achieved his true goal: to analyze U.S. superhuman resources.Strucker won another impressive victory when he secretly began to purchase control over WFET, a television station owned by the Kingpin (Wilson Fisk). When S.H.I.E.L.D became aware of Hydra's involvement, they tipped off Daredevil, who then let word reach the streets. Fisk thought Hydra was his enemy and turned on them, only to have Hydra steal nearly all of his money, destroy his businesses, and help to end his reign as the Kingpin. When the Kingpin's assets were divided amongst criminal factions-including Werner, Andrea, and Andreas, Baron Strucker re-linked with the Hand, who sent their magical warrior Izanami to thin the competition. Strucker also posed as Snakeskin, bodyguard to Werner (who posed as the mastermind of the new Hydra) before slaying Werner for being an unworthy successor.Strucker faced rivalries within Hydra itself, including splinter groups like the Genesis Coalition, and hired the mercenary Next Wave to bring them down; they were assisted by Silver Sable's Wild Pack. Strucker masterminded an attack on the United Nations, but by then, Fury had found proof that Strucker was Hydra's leader.  He tracked him to his base in Iceland, where Strucker killed Fury's lover Kate Neville before his very eyes. Fury and Strucker fought each other on the side of a mountain, and the fight ended with Fury cutting off Strucker's right hand to make him fall towards apparent death.Surviving, Strucker gained a bionic replacement \"Satan Claw\" for his lost hand. He then employed the techno-junkies of System Crash to strengthen Hydra through controlling the information highway, though Daredevil defeated his agents. When the Earth was enthralled by the powers of the Goddess, the \"good\" counterpart of Adam Warlock, Strucker was unaffected, and took the opportunity to attempt revenge upon Striklan-now the Wild Pack mercenary Crippler. Wild Pack and S.H.I.E.L.D saved Crippler. Strucker met with a group of American neo-Nazis to assassinate Slovenian president Wassily Kurov to usurp rule of his nation. Kurov was saved by the Skrull Kill Krew and Captain America, but was also exposed as a Skrull imposter. Strucker also briefly joined with Baron Helmut Zemo in a world-conquering plot foiled by the Avengers and Thunderbolts, though Stucker and Zemo parted as foes.Strucker eventually launched an ambitious plan where he infested key people such as Henry Gyrich of the Commission on Superhuman Activities with nannites, allowing him to control them. Under Strucker's influence, Gyrich nearly killed every superhuman on Earth with the nannites. Strucker's involvement was finally discovered by the V-Battalion, who thwarted his attempt to control everyone on Earth with nannites.Strucker married again to a woman named Elsbeth, but she had little regard for him, and was taken instead by his mutant bodyguard the Gorgon. Elsbeth and the Gorgon conspired to overthrow Strucker by creating a genetically engineered clone of him, who then conspired with the Hand to have Wolverine placed under their control to prepare for an army of similarly controlled superhumans. The real Strucker had placed the hero Abe Jenkins of the Thunderbolts into his debt by funding his team, and pit the team against threats he had helped fund, including the Wrecking Crew, Fathom Five, and the Great Game, unaware of Elsbeth's actions until Elsbeth and the Gorgon sent Wolverine to assassinate Strucker. Strucker was saved by the Swordsman (secretly Strucker's own son Andreas), and he prepared to reclaim control of Hydra by setting off nuclear bombs in New York. The Thunderbolts opposed him, and he had to abandon the plot in order to deal with Hydra's internal problems. However, he was instead intercepted by Helmut Zemo, who has enlisted Strucker's aid in his own mysterious operations.",

      "biography": "Helmut Zemo was born to greatness-and great darkness. Both legacies began with Harbin Zemo, a minor official in the small town of Zeulniz who single-handedly fought off a band of Slav raiders in 1480. Rewarded with a title as the first Baron Zemo, Harbin became legendary for his bravery, but he also became infamous for his grandiose ego and bloodthirsty temper. In the early 20th Century, scientific genius Heinrich Zemo became the twelfth Baron Zemo. Heinrich and his wife Hilda had a son, Helmut. Born in the 1930s, Helmut spent at least part of his youth in Berlin, developing a fondness for American popular culture imports such as horror films, comic books and movie serials.\n\nMeanwhile, Heinrich became a leading scientist and special agent in Hitler's Nazi regime, inventing an early laser beam (his \"death ray\"), the super-durable Adhesive X, the age-retarding Compound X, and more. While his loving family worshipped him, Heinrich quickly became one of the most despised enemies of the Allied powers, and was also widely disgraced in his own country after a defeat by America's Howling Commandos. Hated and feared both at home and abroad, Heinrich began wearing a hooded disguise almost constantly; he also began going mad, especially after his hood was permanently glued to his head by Adhesive X during a battle with the Allied super-agent Captain America. As Heinrich grew more unstable, he became abusive toward his family. Hilda died helping Captain America thwart Zemo's Medusa Effect scheme, but Helmut remained loyal, helping his father battle the Captain and the hero's young partner Bucky Barnes during that same incident.\n\nIn 1945, Baron Zemo seemingly slew Captain America and Bucky and went into hiding in the Amazon, carving out his own private kingdom with the aid of a mercenary army (including Erik Josten in recent years) and an enslaved native population. In Heinrich's absence, Helmut led a more normal life for decades, studying science and becoming an engineer. Summoned to visit Heinrich's Amazon stronghold, Helmut watched his father ruthlessly crush a native uprising, saw Josten's fanatical devotion to the Baron, and heard Heinrich boast of killing the World War II freedom fighter Citizen V (John Watkins); Helmut was disturbed yet intrigued. Roughly one year later, news of Captain America's survival led to a series of clashes between the Captain (backed by the Avengers) and the Baron (backed by his Masters of Evil). After Heinrich accidentally killed himself during a battle with Captain America, Helmut blamed the Captain for destroying their family. Studying and replicating some of Heinrich's inventions and undergoing combat training, Helmut eventually attacked Captain America in the costumed guise of the Phoenix, also battling the Captain's new partner the Falcon. In the end, Zemo was accidentally knocked into a vat of Adhesive X.\n\nHelmut survived, but with hideous facial scars. As the new Baron Zemo, he targeted Captain America with the aid of his android ally Primus and various mutates created by Zemo's mad geneticist associate Arnim Zola, such as the rat-man Vermin. Zemo also began menacing the Captain's friends, notably Arnie Roth. Barely escaping with his life after Vermin turned on him, Zemo formed an alliance with Nazi mastermind the Red Skull and his daughter Mother Night, allowing them to mentor him in the ways of evil as they launched a series of attacks on Captain America and his friends. Zemo soon wearied of both his subordinate status and his mentors' indiscriminately hateful worldview, so he turned against his allies. Narrowly surviving a psychic assault from Mother Night, the Baron decided to avenge the loss of his family by destroying Captain America's adopted family, the Avengers. Zemo recruited the largest Masters of Evil team yet and led them in occupying Avengers Mansion, capturing and torturing several of the occupants. The Avengers soon retook the Mansion, and Zemo suffered a crippling fall in battle with Captain America.\n\nLater, aided by the mercenary Batroc's Brigade, Zemo battled Captain America and others on a futile quest to resurrect Heinrich with the Bloodstone. Further injured in another fall while escaping, Zemo subsequently tried to press Vermin and the other mutates back into his service, but Spider-Man opposed him, and Vermin ultimately turned on him viciously again. Sometime thereafter, Helmut married the Zemo-inspired terrorist known as the Baroness, who had once claimed to be Heinrich Zemo resurrected in female form. As the Baron and Baroness Zemo, the couple abducted a host of neglected and abused children to create an instant family for themselves, but Captain America freed the children and captured the Zemos with the aid of Diamondback (Rachel Leighton) and Free Spirit.\n\nAfter Heike reportedly died in prison, Zemo had begun to reassemble his Masters when the Avengers (including Captain America) were seemingly slain by Onslaught. Deprived of his greatest foes and his guiding obsession, Zemo finally began to accept the fact that his father had destroyed himself, and that his own obsession with destroying Captain America was ultimately pointless. Shifting his focus from vengeance to power, Zemo led his Masters in masquerading as the Thunderbolts, a new heroic super-team replacing the Avengers, accumulating public trust and resources until they were ready to strike. Zemo himself posed as the new Citizen V in a mockingly ironic nod to Heinrich's old victim. The deception lasted for months, until Zemo used a mind-influencing bio-modem to subjugate much of the planet. Most of the Thunderbolts had grown to like their roles as heroes, though, so they turned against Zemo and foiled his plot, despite his use of the Avengers and the Fantastic Four as mind-controlled pawns. Savagely beaten by his teammate Moonstone (Karla Sofen), who resented Zemo for squandering the potential of their heroic pose, Helmut escaped with the reluctant aid of Thunderbolts member Atlas (Erik Josten), paying his debt to the Zemo family).\n\nPartnered for a time with the robotic Techno, Zemo repeatedly sought revenge on the Thunderbolts. However, he gradually realized that Moonstone was right about his having wasted the group's early potential, and decided it might be better to manipulate the world rather than openly rule it. Stalked by the new Citizen V (Dallas Riordan), who sought to destroy him for tainting the Citizen V legacy, Zemo escaped her but was later killed in his own headquarters by the government assassin Scourge (Jack Monroe).\n\nHowever, Zemo's consciousness survived thanks to a failsafe device engineered by Techno, transplanting Zemo's consciousness into the comatose body of adventurer John Watkins III, the previous Citizen V (true heir to the original). Posing as a revived Citizen V, Zemo reluctantly served the V-Battalion, helping to foil Baron Strucker's mind control conspiracy (of which Scourge had been an unwilling agent). When Strucker's daughter Andrea realized who Citizen V really was, Zemo slew her. For a time, Citizen V led a government-sponsored team of super-agents known as the Redeemers. When Graviton slaughtered the Redeemers, Citizen V teamed with the Thunderbolts to save the world from Graviton, though the battle hurled almost all the Thunderbolts into the Franklin Richards-created Counter-Earth. Zemo's disembodied consciousness went with them, now inhabiting the tech-pack of Fixer (Techno reborn in his original human form), then usurped the body of Counter-Earth's Helmut Zemo with the Fixer's aid.\n\nReborn in an unscarred facsimile of his original body, Zemo at first hoped to conquer Counter-Earth, but reluctantly joined the team's efforts to save the world rather than rule it, slowly coming to regard the business of world-saving as an intriguing and rewarding challenge. Already influenced by his stints with the Thunderbolts and the Redeemers, as well as his time within the brain of John Watkins III, Zemo had begun to show tiny sparks of nobility. He and the other Thunderbolts were soon regarded as beloved heroes by the people of Counter-Earth.\n\nZemo's Thunderbolts were thrown back to their native Earth while saving both worlds from an all-consuming void. They accomplished this with the aid of a new team of Thunderbolts that Hawkeye and Songbird had organized on Earth in their absence, and the two factions of Thunderbolts soon assembled to decide their collective future. Though deeply suspicious of Zemo, Hawkeye was soon convinced that Zemo at least had the desire and potential to reform, and Hawkeye believed he could trust the other Thunderbolts to keep an eye on him. With this in mind, Hawkeye and several others left the group, and the remaining Thunderbolts reorganized under Zemo's leadership. Zemo even began to develop a romantic interest in Moonstone, though whether it was ever mutual is unclear.\n\nZemo's new Thunderbolts soon became internationally celebrated heroes. However, none of the team fully trusted Zemo, and the Avengers regarded him with even greater suspicion, planting Tony Stark in the Cobalt Man suit as a spy within his group. When the Thunderbolts created the global energy-absorbing Liberator project, the Avengers uncovered evidence of a secret failsafe designed to steal its power, and assumed it was Zemo's handiwork. However, when the Avengers interfered in the Liberator's test run, the failsafe turned out to be created by Moonstone. He accidentally absorbed the Liberator energies and went on a power-mad rampage stopped by the combined efforts of both teams, though not before Zemo's face had been horribly scarred again - ironically, while shielding Captain America from Moonstone. In the end, Zemo's Thunderbolts broke up, Moonstone was left comatose, and Zemo absconded with Moonstone's vastly powerful alien gemstones. He has since worked behind the scenes to manipulate the new Thunderbolts without their knowledge, pursuing goals as yet unknown.",

      "biography": "Reports from Nazi soldiers and the Baroness herself state that geneticist Arnim Zola copied the brain patterns of Nazi scientist Heinrich Zemo, just as Zola had done with Adolf Hitler. Whereas Hitler’s mind was transferred into a clone upon death, becoming the Hate-Monger, Zemo’s mind was allegedly transferred into the body of a young woman to disarm others. Regardless, the Baroness’ first recorded activities involve donating money and arms to numerous terrorist states in Eastern Europe. Contracting with the Yakuza, Heike hired the White Ninja to steal the madness-inducing Cassidy Crystals from Osborn Industries. She planned to bombard world capitals with Cassidy Crystals, believing the terror-stricken masses would then welcome a takeover by her Nazi Party. Silver Sable enlisted Spider-Man to stop the Baroness, and the two would be heroes traveled to her Black Forest, Bavaria castle, where they overcame Heike and the White Ninja Their unified efforts allowed them to stop the Crystal-filled missiles. In the process, Heike was exposed to the Crystals and driven temporarily insane. Seeing herself as a monster, she smashed her face into a mirror and tore off her skin. Blinded by blood, she tried to launch the missiles, but inadvertently pressed the self-destruct button. The Baroness fought off Spider-Man’s efforts to rescue her before the castle blew up.Surviving, she later claimed her origins to be false, and she married Baron Zemo (Helmut), Heinrich’s son. Wearing a costume patterned after Helmut’s, with both of them wearing latex masks over their scarred faces, Heike relocated to Castle Zemo in Malpaso, Mexico. They chose 25 children who fit their Aryan profile from Damon Dran’s white slavery ring,, adopting and brainwashing them as their Kinder (named for the Nazi Wunderkinder, or Wonder Kids, a.k.a. the Hitler Youth). Heike met with the radical feminist Superiaa to discuss empowering the children.  When Superia offered Heike a position of power in her organization, Heike expressed interest and her willingness to eliminate Helmut. Overhearing the conversation, Helmut had Heike and Superia gassed and bound, but released Heike after she told him she was only manipulating Superia to gain her process for physical enhancement. However, Captain America (Steve Rogers), Diamondback (Rachel Leighton), and Free Spirit, all having tracked the missing children-overcame the Zemos’s defenses and attacked them. Both Zemos were dove into a molten vat of Adhesive X, protected by their insulated costumes, and escaped down a tunnel, but Captain America recaptured them. Helmut Zemo later heard that Heike died in prison.",

      "biography": "The history and background of Baroness S’Bak was under investigation by the Nova Corps. She is one of several minor warlords currently in control of remnants of the Skrull Empire; she appears to have no current desire to rise to the position of Empress, at least not at this time. She has what appeared to be two short horns on her head. Whether this is just a feature of her headdress, or if it is her head is unknown. The Annihilation Wave’s course of destruction ran directly through her region, it is unknown how many of her worlds have fell victim to the Wave’s genocidal destruction. It has been confirmed that the Super Skrull, Kl’rt came to her seeking aid against the planet-destroying Harvester of Sorrows, which was created by the Negative Zone scientist Hawal.This weapon of mass destruction destroyed the Skrull planet of Aks’lo within the Star System 004. What exactly happened at that meeting is still unclear, but apparently, S’bak refused the Super-Skrulls request to mount an attack against the Harvester of Sorrow. The Baroness was unwilling to leave herself open to an attack from a rival Warlord, by fighting a super weapon that no one knew how to destroy quickly. S’Bak then called the Super Skrull a laughingstock and an embarrassment to the entire Skrull Empire. She described his exploits as cautionary tales of failure. After constantly being, insulted Kl’rt punched the Baroness hard in the mouth, leading her to order her troops to kill him for treason. Kl’rt escaped the Baroness and her soldiers. He continued to search for allies against the Harvester of Sorrows. The Baroness put up a bounty of three million, golden z’lacks for the capture of the Super Skrull dead or alive. Before the Nova Corps destruction by the Annihilation Wave, the Nova Corps received the assignment of monitoring the actions of Baroness S’bak. There were rumors that she may have had ambitions to overthrow the other Skrull Warlords, which have been invading her realm. Her territory borders Kree space, resulting in qualms amongst the Skrulls that she has brokered a peaceful alliance with members of the Kree government. There are even reports of her convincing the Accuser-Prime Ronan into annexing a portion of the Kree Empire.",

      "biography": "Basil Elks was a convicted burglar with an undistinguished criminal career. One of his fellow prison inmates, who was more erudite than the rest, mocked Elks by making a pun on his name and calling him \"Basilisk,\" after the mythological creature which could kill with its glance. Other prisoners seized upon the new nickname as a means of ridiculing Elks, thus ironically contrasting the basilisk's fearsome reputation with Elks' own image of being a loser.After leaving prison, Elks attempted to steal a large gem from a New York City museum. Elks was discovered by a museum guard and reached for his gun, unwilling to return to prison and face further ridicule. The guard fired his own gun, but his bullet struck not Elks but the gem, causing it to explode. Unknown to Elks and the museum authorities, the gem was actually the so-called Alpha-Stone, a power object once possessed by the alien Kree. A Kree starship crewman had stolen both the Alpha-Stone and another such gem, the Omega-Stone, and escaped in a small spaceship, which exploded; somehow the two gems ended up on Earth. The explosion of the Alpha-Stone transformed Elks into a superhuman being, who overpowered the guard and escaped. Elks adopted the name \"Basilisk\" as one that was appropriate to his newfound powers, and sought the Omega-Stone in order to increase them. In the course of his search, Basilisk clashed with both Spider-Man and the Kree Captain Mar-Vell. The Omega-Stone was embedded underground in the Wall Street area of lower Manhattan. Captain Mar-Vell found the gem, but when he touched it, the gem grew to gigantic size and enveloped him.The enlarged Omega-Stone was then teleported to the underground domain of the Mole Man, who intended to use its energies to power the immense laser-cannon he planned to use to attack the surface world. Spider-Man and Mister Fantastic opposed the Mole Man, but Basilisk, arrived at the scene, and Captain Mar-Vell freed himself from the Omega-Stone, which returned to its previous size. The laser cannon malfunctioned, causing magma pits to erupt. When the Basilisk reached for the Omega-Stone, he was covered by molten lava.However, the Omega Stone had grown and encased the Basilisk at his touch, protecting him from the lava. Basilisk was immobile inside the Omega-Stone, which was eventually found by members of the underground race of Molian Subterraneans, one of whom somehow, unintentionally, released Basilisk from the Omega-Stone by touching it. Basilisk now possessed the powers given him by both the Alpha-Stone and Omega-Stone. He caused a volcano to rise in the Savage Land in Antarctica, and fought the Thing within the volcano. Basilisk had used his increased powers to begin volcanic chain reaction with which he intended to destroy civilization, thereby gaining vengeance for the ridicule he had endured in the past. Basilisk teleported himself and the Thing into a volcano he caused to rise just off New York City, in the Hudson River. Basilisk proceeded to wreak havoc in New York City, but was fought by Spider-Man and the Thing, who knocked him towards his own volcano. As Basilisk lost consciousness, his destructive eye-beams went out of control and blew up the volcano. Basilisk found himself trapped underground.Months later, Basilisk finally reached the surface, emerging at the site where the Fantastic Four's new headquarters, Four Freedoms Plaza, was being constructed. However, no sooner had Basilisk appeared than he was ignominiously murdered by the enigmatic vigilante Scourge, who was disguised as a workman.",

      "biography": "Bastion was \"born\" when the giant robotic Sentinel Master Mold-having absorbed the advanced Sentinel prototype Nimrod into its systems-fought the X-Men, who saw no other way to stop the virtually indestructible amalgam except to force it through the Siege Perilous, a pan-dimensional portal which subjects those who pass through to the judgment of the universe's higher powers. Reemerging from the portal as an amnesiac human/Sentinel hybrid with a seemingly immortal essence, Bastion's prime directives were soon reawakened, and he began assembling the international anti-mutant strike force Operation: Zero Tolerance (OZT). Bastion confined the X-Men's founder Professor Charles Xavier in an OZT facility along with the artificially-created mutant Mannites, and then captured young former X-Man Jubilee. Soon after, Bastion put OZT into full effect, utilizing Prime Sentinels - a new breed created from humans unknowingly implanted with nanotechnology - to attack the X-Men, quickly capturing several members. Bastion took control of the Xavier Institute and accessed Xavier's files, despite opposition from Cable and Caliban of X-Force. The five captured X-Men and Jubilee ultimately managed to escape, and OZT was shut down by the U.S. government. Bastion was remanded into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, but he escaped and returned to the former OZT facility. There, he absorbed the energy from the Master Mold unit with which he had created the Prime Sentinels and sought to transform Machine Man into the Sentinel Supreme; he was opposed by Cable, and seemingly destroyed.Bastion survived and was recaptured by S.H.I.E.L.D. An attack by Apocalypse's Horseman Death (actually a brainwashed Wolverine), who was seeking to kill the Mannites, left only Bastion's head still intact; Bastion survived. Later, Bastion's head was recovered by the robotic Gatekeeper servants of the techno-organic being Mainspring. Bastion co-opted one of the Gatekeeper's bodies, and used it to attack the techno-organic hero Warlock and his allies. Defeated, Bastion's head was recovered by Mainspring, who stripped away the layers of his programming to reveal the original Master Mold's source code and, using the alien transmode virus he was infected with, rewrote Bastion's programming, transforming him into Template. The virus soon took complete control of Template and forced him to construct a Babel Spire on Earth to signal the alien Technarchy. To oppose them, Mainspring destroyed himself along with Template, while Warlock managed to destroy the Babel Spire.Bastion's head was later retrieved by U.S. government agents in order to access the information he had stolen from Xavier's files. The information was retrieved by the X-Men, but not before Bastion attempted to sow mistrust among them by confronting them with misleading holographic scenarios. Recently, the Purifiers reformed Bastion.",

      "biography": "Young Jimmy Santini accompanied his father on a trip to investigate possible illegal waste-dumping in Carlsbad Caverns National Park, where his father was killed by polluters, either shot in the back or by falling to his death in a deep cavern (the details in Jimmy's diary were very murky). Jimmy was left alone, lost in the caverns for an unknown amount of time, where to survive he drank chemically polluted water. Eventually, he was rescued, and returned to his mother. However, the chemicals began to take effect, and Jimmy sprouted wings, and his mother proclaimed him a demon. Jimmy ran away, further mutating as he wandered the country, stealing food in order to survive. Eventually, he came to New York and made his home under an old pier. Jimmy began stealing food from people dining on rooftops, scaring people away with his appearance and cries, to avoid hurting anyone. His appearance caused the press to dub him \"Batwing.\"Jimmy swooped down upon New York City Councilman Randolph Cherryh and his girlfriend as they dined on the rooftop of Cherryh's high-rise. Terrified, Cherryh told Batwing \"Take the girl! Not me!\" But Jimmy just stole a few apples from the table. Humiliated, Cherryh decided to put a high bounty on Batwing. Peter Parker, who was having financial problems at the time, decided to go after the little bat creature. He arranged for a large party at Randolph's home, hoping to lure Batwing into the open. It worked, but Spider-Man was horrified when Cherryh's men began shooting at the creature. He webbed their guns up, and then took off after the fleeing creature. Batwing scratched him several times with his claws while trying to escape, and when Spider-Man hit him back, he fled back to his home under the pier.Spider-Man followed him, and discovered that Batwing was only a frightened child, stealing food to survive. He read in Jimmy's diary about his history and offered to help him, but the boy was scared and burst through the pier, right into the hands of Cherryh and his men, who had secretly been following in a helicopter. The Councilman didn't care that Jimmy was just a kid, and was about to kill him when Spider-Man intervened, webbing down his men. Batwing flew off, terrified, despite Spider-Man's offer to get Reed Richards or Henry Pym to help cure him. Cherryh threatened to ruin Spider-Man's life for interfering, but Spider-Man just told him off, webbed his mouth shut, and stuck him in a garbage can. When the police arrived and searched Batwing's lair, Spider-Man hoped that when they found the diary, they might be able to get help for Jimmy.Spider-Man struck a friendship with Batwing, bringing him food and companionship even though he still rejected help since he was still afraid of people like Cherryh.Spider-Man later asked his friend Dr. Curt Connors to use his expertise to help cure Jimmy. However, an accident in the lab caused Connors' villainous alter-ego the Lizard to emerge, and he battled and defeated Spider-Man before fleeing into the sewers. Spider-Man managed to create an antidote and went into the sewers to cure Dr. Connors. After curing Dr. Connors, Connors and Batwing left New York on train to go somewhere where they can find a cure in peace.While attempting to cure Jimmy, Dr. Connors failed and Jimmy reverted to Batwing. He returned to New York and engaged Spider-Man in another battle. Spider-Man was unwilling to hurt Jimmy. Jimmy, with his father dead and his mother rejecting him, just wanted to die. Spider-Man tracked down Jimmy's mother and told her that he was still her son, creature or not, and that she was wrong to reject him. Just as Batwing was about to be shot by the NYPD, Jimmy's mother intervened, telling her son that she loved him. Upon hearing this and knowing that he was loved, Jimmy reverted back into his human form and the police backed off. Jimmy went home with his mother, finally receiving the love that he had needed so badly.",

      "biography": "Barnell Bohusk has lived a difficult life since his mutation first manifested. Always wanting to find a better life, Barnell threw himself into his studies at Xavier's. He also befriended the Beast, finding a common bond with the X-Man with the most severe physical mutation. It was this bond that led him to visit the Beast with a gift, a baseball bat. Horribly, Beak was mentally possessed by a Cassandra Nova-controlled Charles Xavier and forced to beat his mentor brutally. The Beast would eventually recover, but Beak's guilt never went away. Mocked by his peers at the Xavier Institute for his seemingly useless mutation, Beak gravitated towards a group of young mutants known as the special class - mutants with little drive and less ability. Ironically, in this class Beak truly began to realize his worth as a hero. The other special class students began to look up to him as a leader and he filled that role as best he could. This group also included his girlfriend and the mother of his children, Angel. Angel does care for Beak, but their relationship began when other students bet her to kiss him. This group was mentored by Xorn who secretly believed he was truly Magneto. Beak and the rest of his special class followed Xorn, becoming the new Brotherhood in his bid to take over of the world. Beak stood up to Xorn and was cast out of the Brotherhood. He and a small group of X-Men were able to overtake Xorn and free New York City from his grip. Beak returned to the Xavier Institute and moved into a small home on campus with Angel and their children.Soon after, the Exiles arrived at the Xavier Institute and Beak was forced to join their reality-fixing group. He left Angel and his children behind, unable to say goodbye to them. Angel assumed he deserted her.After a number of adventures with the Exiles, Beak was reunited with Angel when they visited the Earth while it was under the sway of the House of M|Scarlet Witch's reality warp. Upon the reversal of this warp Beak lost his mutant powers and is currently living the life of a normal human.",

      "biography": "While working at a nuclear power plant, Norton McCoy was exposed to massive amounts of radiation that affected his genes. As a result, Norton's son, Henry \"Hank\" McCoy, was born a mutant who showed the signs of his being different from birth with his unusually large hands and feet. As a youth, Hank's freakish appearance was the subject of much ridicule from his classmates, earning him the nickname of \"Beast\". However, one classmate named Jennifer came to know the real Hank after he began tutoring her in biology. On the night of the junior prom, Jennifer insisted that Hank accompany her as her date, and stood up for him after he was teased.\n\nIn his senior year, Hank's superhuman agility and athletic prowess earned him recognition as a star football player. During one game, Hank easily stopped a trio of robbers who were attempting to escape across the football field. His efforts were noticed by the villain named the Conquistador who kidnapped Hank's parents in an effort to coerce the young mutant into working for him. The X-Men soon arrived and defeated the villain, and Hank was invited by Professor Charles Xavier&nbsp;to join the team of teenage mutant heroes and enroll in the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters. Unable to resist the temptation of a private institution that could offer him limitless academic opportunities, Hank accepted. Hank's days were rich with differential equations, Proust and workouts in the Danger Room.\n\nA brilliant student, Hank completed his doctoral studies under Xavier's tutelage, and finally graduated from the Xavier School to take a position at the Brand Corporation as a genetic researcher under Doctor Carl Maddicks. During one of his experiments, Hank discovered the hormonal extract that causes genetic mutation and went to inform Maddicks of his findings. However, Maddicks was secretly plotting to steal top secret government documents, and Hank took it upon himself to stop Maddicks. In order to disguise his appearance, Hank took the extract and underwent radical physical changes that enhanced his agility and strength, as well as causing him to grow fangs, pointed ears, and fur all over his body. When he stayed too long in this state, Hank found he could not return to his original form. He was now a beast in fact as well as in name. At first, he tried to hide his mutation with a latex mask and gloves, but later learned to accept his new appearance.\n\nAfter receiving his doctorate in genetics and being considered one of the world's experts on mutations and evolutionary human biology, despite never having earned a Nobel Prize or been invited to join the National Academy of Sciences, Hank left Brand and applied to join the ranks of Earth's Mightiest Heroes, the Avengers. Initially accepted as a probationary member, Hank soon proved his worth and was granted full membership. During his time with the team he revealed his identity to the public in the hope that his status as an Avenger would help ease human/mutant tensions.\n\nFollowing a restructuring of the Avengers, Hank left and became involved with the team of adventurers known as the Defenders which he soon reorganized into a more formal and cohesive unit, bringing in his former X-Men teammates&nbsp;Icemanand Angel. Following the apparent death of several of the Defenders, Hank reunited with the other four original X-Men to form X-Factor, an organization that intended to seek out and aid other mutants under the pretense of hunting them down. Shortly after the formation of X-Factor, Hank was captured by Maddicks who sought to experiment on Hank in an attempt to find a \"cure\" for his&nbsp;son's&nbsp;own mutancy. However, the serum Hank was given caused him to revert to his original human appearance. Soon after, Hank first met television anchorwoman Trish Tilby, who was investigating X-Factor.\n\nDuring an attack on New York by the eternal mutant&nbsp;Apocalypse&nbsp;and his Four Horsemen, Hank was stricken with a virus that sapped his intellect and increased his strength every time he exerted himself physically. The more Hank used his strength, the stronger he got, but the less intelligent he became. Finally, to save his friend Iceman from the deadly kiss of the mutant named Infectia, Hank intervened and was himself affected, the result of which returned him to his blue-furred form and restored his intellect. Soon after, Hank and Trish began seeing each other romantically, however her work often intruded on their relationship and the pair ultimately called it off.\n\nAfter X-Factor disbanded, Hank returned to the ranks of the X-Men and became the team's resident technological and medical genius, working on everything from advanced alien technology to the deadly mutant-killing Legacy Virus. Hank also continued his on/off relationship with Trish until she released information on the Virus to the public, which caused hysteria that culminated in the beating to death of a young mutant. During this tenure with the X-Men, Hank was lured into a trap and replaced in the ranks of the X-Men by the&nbsp;Dark Beast, an alternate-reality version of himself. Sealed behind a brick wall, Hank was nearly about to give up and let fate win when his water tube broke and spurted, revealing the grooves of a trap door in his cell. Energized by hope, Hank broke his restraints and escaped with the aid of the new government-sponsored X-Factor team. Hank returned to the X-Men, and soon after met with Trish to apologize for his previous harsh treatment of her. She forgave him and the pair renewed their relationship.\n\nHank eventually took an extended leave of absence from the X-Men to work on a cure for the Legacy Virus, which he ultimately found thanks to his implementing the work of his former colleague, the late&nbsp;Moira MacTaggert. Soon after, Hank joined&nbsp;Storm's team of X-Treme X-Men in their quest for the diaries of the late mutant seer&nbsp;Destiny. Almost killed in the team's first battle with the villainous&nbsp;Vargas, Hank's life was saved by his teammate&nbsp;Tessa&nbsp;who used a heretofore-unseen power to accelerate the Beast's mutation to a new level. Hank returned to Xavier's mansion to recuperate and mutated further, becoming bulkier, heavier, and taking on a more leonine appearance. Forced to relearn fine motor control over his body, Hank once again served as the team's resident genius, as well as an active teacher of dozens of young mutants at the renamed Xavier Institute of Higher Learning.\n\nUnable to deal with his latest mutation, Trish called Hank and ended their relationship over the phone. Soon after, Hank was beaten into a coma by&nbsp;Beak, who was possessed by Professor Xavier's malevolent twin&nbsp;Cassandra Nova, who herself had possessed Xavier's body. Hank recovered in time to expose her plans and Cassandra was ultimately defeated, but not before she had exposed her brother Charles to the world as a mutant, forever changing life at the Xavier mansion for the X-Men.",

      "biography": "Henry McCoy grew up taunted as “Monkey Boy” and “Joe Bananas” because of his apelike appearance; when he was identified as a mutant, his parents rejected him as well. Henry chose to hide his immense intelligence to avoid further complications. In his late teens he was recruited by Jean Grey (Marvel Girl) and dubbed Beast, becoming a founding member of Charles Xavier‘s X-Men. Beast took on the role of the team's elite engineer, upgrading the X-Men's Blackbird X-Jet and Danger Room sequences. He helped rescue Bobby Drake (Iceman) from Sentinels in Times Square and fell in love with his team mate Storm, though low self esteem prevented him from openly expressing it. When the X-Men battled the Brotherhood of Mutants in Croatia to rescue the U.S. President’s kidnapped daughter, Beast was critically injured. A revolutionary transplant technique that placed kangaroo and gorilla organs in his body saved his life, but a side effect turned his hair blue. In spite of this close call, he soon returned to action when Magneto led a Sentinel attack on Washington, an attack that ended in Magneto’s apparent death. Beast and Storm became an item, though he couldn’t understand why such a beautiful girl would be interested in a “fat guy“. Dr. Cornelius enhanced Beast’s animalistic qualities when the X-Men were abducted by rogue government agency Weapon X, leaving him with blue fur, claws and fangs. Even more insecure about his looks, Beast began an online correspondence with “Naomi” actually the Brotherhood’s Blob playing a prank. After rogue telepath David Xavier claimed his father Charles had made Storm fall for Beast in order to keep Hank in the school, Beast shut Storm out, fearing it was true; he increasingly confided in Naomi, eventually revealing Magneto’s survival. The Brotherhood ambushed Beast, beating him until he disclosed Magneto’s location. With Magneto’s return, the X-Men became fugitives, hunted by the authorities, battling S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Ultimates; they finally redeemed themselves by recapturing Magneto and preventing him from destroying Florida. With the X-Men  recognized as heroes, Hank was shocked to find his parents now accepted him, though he realized they merely wished to cash in on his newfound fame. Renewing his relationship with Storm, Beast continued to be active on the Internet, carelessly discussing the X-Men’s angelic new recruit Warren Worthington on his fan website. When religious demonstrations ensued, Hank’s teammates berated him for his foolishness. Feeling insecure again, and aware of the handsome Warren’s attraction to Storm, Beast quit the X-Men after he was approached for Emma Frost’s new mutant spokesperson program. At the group’s public unveiling, a rogue government faction released a Sentinel; while trying to get others to safety, Beast was struck by debris and killed. He was buried in the Xavier Mansion grounds in a private ceremony; his parents did not bother to attend. However, it has recently been revealed that Beast did not die in the attack.  Shortly afterward, in the hospital, doctors were able to revive him.  But before the X-Men were notified, Nick Fury and Professor X stepped in and transported him to the Triskelion, where he was to work on finding a cure to the Legacy Virus.  Professor X psychically convinced Hank that the X-Men knew he was alive and well, though they in fact believed him dead.  After the Professor’s apparent “death,” Beast learned the truth, and became upset at Nick Fury for lying to him.  However, he continued residing in the Triskelion, still presumed dead, researching and experimenting.  One of these experiments resulted in Beast’s skin to return to its normal pigment, instead of blue.He later rescued Pyro, and shocked his former teammates by revealing that he was still alive. After being proved to be the real Beast by Psylocke and Wolverine, he was allowed to join Bishop's new X-Men and continued his relationship with Storm. After Bishop's death, Xavier was revealed to be alive and Beast returned to his life at the Xavier Institute. Although, during Magneto's flooding of New York, Hank was pushed by the water into a store and has gone missing.",

Separated from his brother, Jesse became emotionally unstable and was committed to a psychiatric institution after seeing several therapists. There his mutant nature manifested, and Jesse’s doctor saw his condition as a means to getting a book published by subjecting him to a series of cruel tests. Jesse was rescued by members of the Mutant Underground Support Engine (M.U.S.E.), who cared for Jesse’s well-being while training him as a field agent, codenamed Bedlam.Seeking his brother, Jesse soon left M.U.S.E. and tracked down the mutant mercenary Domino, whom he believed could help him. He cut a deal with Domino, agreeing to give her the location of Ekatarina Gryaznova (the Prime Sentinel who implanted her with a neural-disruption device that shorted out her mutant powers during Operation: Zero Tolerance) in return for her aid in finding Christopher. Domino agreed, but only if Jesse took her to Gryaznova first. They broke into the Aguilar Institute, but Domino was captured. Jesse escaped and sought the help of the mutant strike team X-Force. During the subsequent rescue, Jesse used his power to free Domino of her implant’s effects. He and Domino then found Christopher leading the mutant team the New Hellions. Forced to choose between his X-Force friends and his rediscovered family, Jesse at first sided with his brother; however, after learning of Christopher’s insane plan to gain control of the dangerous Armageddon Man, Jesse joined X-Force in opposing him.Soon after, X-Force traveled to Genosha to help former British black ops agent Pete Wisdom rescue an old friend. There Jesse received the memories of a well-trained martial arts student from a memory box created by the mutant Delphi. Later, Wisdom trained X-Force as a covert operations unit, helping Jesse increase the scope of his powers. He remained a member of the team until their apparent death in the explosion of an alien spaceship. X-Force subsequently resurfaced without Jesse, who was later captured by the Church of Humanity and crucified on the Xavier Institute grounds. Despite the X-Men’s best efforts, Jesse apparently died from his injuries.",

Bella first met Remy LeBeauGambit when they were children. Although she and LeBeau came from very different backgrounds, they nevertheless became fast friends. After LeBeau was accepted into the Thieves’ Guild, Bella’s friendship with him was seen as a chance for an alliance between the Guilds, and the two were betrothed by their respective parents. Immediately after the wedding, Bella’s brother Julien refused accept their marriage and challenged LeBeau to a duel. LeBeau won, and as punishment for killing an Assassin he was excommunicated from the Thieves’ Guild and exiled from New Orleans.Over the ensuing years, Bella’s own mutant powers manifested, and she grew bitter toward LeBeau for abandoning her. The External Candra was a driving force behind the Assassins’ Guild, and she too held a grudge against LeBeau. Candra perpetuated Bella’s hatred for him, and even assisted her in developing her mutant powers. Subsequently, at a time when the Guilds were being infiltrated by the insectoid alien Brood, Bella sought LeBeau, now Gambit of the X-Men, to help in opposing them and allied with them and the Spirit of Vengeance Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch) against the Brood. Bella was instrumental in defeating the Brood Queen, but nearly died from the strain and fell into a coma. Gambit was able to obtain the Elixir of Life from Candra to heal Bella; however, during the process, Gambit’s lover and X-Men teammate Rogue accidentally touched Bella, thus unwittingly absorbing some of her memories. As a result, Bella awoke without any knowledge of who she was or her past with Gambit.Eventually Bella’s memories returned and, following her father’s death, she assumed leadership of the Assassins’ Guild. Seeking revenge, Bella kidnapped Rogue’s childhood friend Cody, luring Rogue into a fight. Bella had Candra strip both Bella’s and Rogue’s powers, but Rogue was still able to defeat her. Later, Bella took advantage of several contracts taken out on Gambit’s life by the New Son, the Gambit of an alternate reality. Gambit had since become patriarch of the Thieves’ Guild, and Bella confronted him after he defeated the mercenaries hired to kill him. They became trapped in a collapsed building, wherein they reconciled their differences after Bella confessed that she still loved him. They agreed to work together in uniting the Guilds, and though Gambit was initially voted in as leader, he eventually stepped down and Bella took up the position.Bella later met and romanced Bandit, who was secretly using her to gain control of the Unified Guild. Gambit was able to provide her with proof of his scheme, and after teaming with him and Gambit against mutinous Guild members, she rejected Bandit.",

      "biography": "Ex-hippy Ben Parker lived in a commune for a short time before he met his wife, May. A kind and good-natured man, Ben found married life agreeable and his family welcomed his wife as one of their own. Ben was close to his younger brother, Richard, and his family, often spending time with them and the family of Richard's partner, Eddie Brock; when Richard and his wife died in a plane crash, Ben and May took in their nephew, Peter. Uncle Ben took over as Peter's father figure, and as Peter grew older, Ben recognized his nephew's intelligence and did his best to encourage him in academics. Perhaps because of his intelligence, Peter was often bullied, and Ben did his best to prevent it, even going so far as to join Peter during a certain lunch hall and convincing Peter's old friend, Mary Jane Watson, to sit with them. During a field trip to Oscorp the next day, Peter was bit by the experimental \"00\" spider, causing him to faint and giving him amazing powers - powers Ben never suspected. CEO Norman Osborn, fearful the Parkers would sue, picked up the hospital bill, but Ben never considered a lawsuit, worrying it would break up Peter's friendship with Norman's son, Harry Osborn.Several days later, the parents of Peter's classmate, Flash Thompson, called Ben and threatened to sue the Parkers because Peter had accidentally broken Flash's hand defending himself in a fight. Ben agreed to pay the hospital bill, even though he believed the altercation to be Flash's fault, as there was no way they could afford a lawyer. Their financial worries abated when they began receiving letters filled with cash, allegedly donated by Peter's teachers; in truth, the money was from their nephew, who was secretly earning it by wrestling.As Peter took advantage of his newfound powers by joining the basketball team, his grades plummeted, causing a loud argument with Ben. Peter ran away from home, staying at classmate Kong Harlan's house. In his parent's absence, Kong threw a large party; arriving there, Ben pulled Peter outside for a heart-to-heart talk. Ben told Peter his father's philosophy on life, \"if there are things you do better than anyone else, things you could do to help people, it is your responsibility to do them.\" Overcome with emotion, Peter ran away again.Dejected, Ben went home where he discovered a burglar, ironically a man Peter had refused to stop during another robbery just hours before. The burglar demanded money, but Ben joked with him saying, \"you probably have more money than we do.\" Angered, the burglar shot Ben, killing him.",

The Korbinites then amassed their fleet, put themselves into stasis, and followed Beta's ship, Skuttlebutt. Bill fought legions of demons sent by Surtur.As the fleet approached the Milky Way galaxy, it was detected by a S.H.I.E.L.D. satellite. Nick Fury asked Thor to investigate. Thor was deemed a threat by Skuttlebutt, so Beta fought him. During the battle Thor was separated from his hammer, Mjolnir, and reverted to Donald Blake. Curious, Bill picked up Mjolnir and the hammer deemed him worthy, granting him the power of Thor. Skuttlebutt landed but both were transported to Asgard by Odin. Bill said the hammer should remain his as he had won it fairly.Odin subsequently decreed the two battle in Skartheim to the death to see who would reclaim the hammer. Bill's Korbinite physiology gave him somewhat of an advantage in the lava-filled realm, and he was able to win. However, he refused to take Thor's life. It is believed that Odin chose this location to further test Bill's worthiness and to teach Thor a lesson. Mjolnir was returned to Thor, with Odin ordering the creation of the hammer Stormbreaker for Bill to use. Bill continued to protect his people and assist the Asgardians. He grew particularly close to Sif, who accompanied him to battle Surtur's demons.At one point, a mysterious disease seemed to kill the Korbinites, but they were able to be revived. Bill spent time in space as part of the Star Masters, and was called to join his fellow hammer wielders Thor, Thunderstrike, and Dargo Ktor to battle as the Thor Corps. His body briefly was reconfigured to use cosmic rather than mystical powers through a special synthesis by Odin and the Silver Surfer.Years later, long after Bill had found a new home for his people, Ragnarok loomed over Asgard and Bill, drawn by the Asgardian magic in his hammer, returned to fight along side the surviving Asgardians in the final battle, reducing Fenris to a skeleton on his arrival as punishment for threatening a weakened Thor. He fought ferociously, willing to die alongside the Asgardians in the climactic final battle against Surtur's forces. But Thor sent him back to his people, asking him to keep the memory of Asgard alive and to honor his memory. Very reluctantly, Bill went.\n\nThe Korbinites had settled on a new planet, but were in danger due to an approaching foe. Bill was chastised for spending too much time with the Asgardians. His old rival Alpha Ray even attempted to sabotage his efforts to prove he was no longer worthy of being the race's guardian. The foe was actually Galactus, Stormbreaker revealing his familiar humanoid form, with a new herald named Stardust. The planet was lost and some of the fleet was destroyed. Stardust continued to attack Bill as Galactus fed on the planet's energies. During their battle the evil Asteroth was mistakenly freed from its prison by a portal Stardust opened. Asteroth was defeated, and Bill eventually found himself on Earth. He has since bonded with a man named Simon Walters. After the Civil War, Bill, in the form of Simon Walters, was compelled by magic forces to travel to Canada. There he found the Wrecking Crew running riot in a museum. Seeking to protect the innocent bystanders Simon changed into Beta Ray Bill and fought the magically powered thugs. And due to a recent increase in their powers by a magical entity the battle came to a draw between them. However the new Omega Flight soon came by in order to rescue their teammate Sasquatch who at the time was possessed by the demonic Tanaraq. During the battle hordes of demons rioted throughout the city causing mass chaos. Once the Wrecking Crew and Sasquatch were secured Beta Ray Bill led the demons back into the portal while fellow Omega Flight member Guardian destroyed the portal behind them, closing it. Beta Ray Bill was then trapped in that other dimension fighting demon hordes.Somehow, Bill managed to escape from that dimension and was captured by the Skrulls. As part of their invasion they dissected and tortured Bill to learn more about him and study his genetic material. They also studied Bill's hammer Stormbreaker. Somehow managing to escape, Bill fled to Earth where he landed in Asgard, Oklahoma. Here his friend Thor helped heal Bill back to health. Upon awakening, Bill warned his fellow Asgardians about the looming threat of the Skrulls. The Skrulls then descended upon Asgard as Thor gave Bill his Mjolnir so Donald Blake could help the near-by city. After defeating much of the Skrull forces, a Super-Skrull arrived and beat Bill using his own hammer, which they had altered and used for that Super-Skrull.",

      "biography": "Raised by a single mother and often disappointed by her weak-willed brother Bennett, young Betty Brant found herself drawn to strong men. While still in high school, she dated university student Gordon Savinski, a fast-living friend of her older brother. Gordon and the Brant siblings were a chummy trio for some time, but Savinski's wild and reckless ways gradually estranged Betty and endangered Bennett. When Gordon and Bennett incurred a huge gambling debt to mobster Blackie Gaxton, Savinski callously abandoned Bennett, leaving the Brants to face the consequences. Gaxton's thugs came to the Brant home, and Betty's mother, Eleonore, suffered permanent brain damage in the resultant scuffle. Forced to grow up fast, Betty dropped out of school so she could work to pay off her mother's medical bills and her brother's gambling debts. Betty's mother had been the personal secretary to J. Jonah Jameson, the tyrannical publisher of the Daily Bugle newspaper. Perhaps out of sympathy for Betty or out of loyalty to Eleonore, Jameson offered Betty her mother's job at the Bugle, and Betty accepted. Patient, hardworking and capable, Betty proved to be one of the very few secretaries who ever managed to meet Jameson's demanding standards while tolerating the publisher's prickly personality. Over time, a mutual attraction developed between Betty and young Bugle photographer Peter Parker, secretly the costumed hero Spider-Man. Peter bore a striking resemblance to Gordon Savinski; but unlike Gordon, Parker was quiet, serious, moral, responsible-in short, he seemed safe. Peter first noticed Betty when she stuck up for Peter's alter ego during one of Jameson's anti-Spider-Man tirades. Later, Peter and Betty grew closer when they shared an intimate chat in the wrecked Bugle offices after an attack by the Vulture. Before long, they were a couple, and Betty became Peter's first real girlfriend. Intensely danger-shy after Gordon, Betty worried incessantly about the hazards of Peter's job, which often required him to photograph criminals and super-villains in action. When the criminal Enforcers came after Betty to collect on the Brant family's remaining debts, Betty tried to protect Peter by leaving town, then tried to wipe out the last of her brother's debts by recruiting Doctor Octopus to break Blackie Gaxton out of prison. When Spider-Man intervened, Gaxton was recaptured, but not before Bennett sacrificed himself to shield Betty from a stray bullet. A devastated Betty blamed Spider-Man for the tragedy at first, and Peter decided he could never share the secret of his double identity with her. Betty returned to her job at the Bugle, but found little peace there; she was soon menaced in turn by Doctor Octopus, the Sinister Six and her old boyfriend Gordon, who had become the superhuman mob enforcer Terrier. Spider-Man defeated all these foes, but his role in her brother's death still made her wary of him. Deeply insecure, Betty was often jealous of Peter's female friends, and she sometimes assumed that the oft-absent Peter was two-timing her, or had simply grown tired of her. Betty responded by dating Ned Leeds, a new reporter at the Bugle who only had eyes for her. For a time, Betty was romantically linked to both Peter and Ned while she tried to sort out her feelings. Eventually, a smitten Ned proposed marriage. Betty was still in love with Peter, but she craved the stability she thought Ned represented. While Betty stalled for time to make up her mind, Peter decided Betty would be better off without Spider-Man in her life and acted boorishly in an effort to drive her away altogether. Finally, seeing Peter injured after an encounter with Doctor Octopus, Betty realized she couldn't bear to love another man who lived dangerously. She left town again to think things through, and by the time she returned, she and Peter came to the mutual realization that the romantic spark between them was gone. Happily reunited with Leeds, Betty accepted Ned's proposal. Engaged for years, Ned and Betty finally got married despite the interference of the costumed criminal Mirage, who tried to rob the wedding guests until he was subdued by Spider-Man. Jameson sent the couple to Paris on a \"working honeymoon\" to establish Ned as a European foreign correspondent; however, with Ned constantly off on assignment, Betty grew lonely and bitter. Separating from Ned and returning to New York, she sought comfort with Peter, who was tempted to rekindle their old romance; but when an angry Ned arrived to fight for Betty, Peter pretended he wasn't really interested in her and declared he never wanted to see either of them again, hoping this might bring the couple back together. Stung, Betty and Ned went away together to rebuild their marriage. Ned continued to throw himself into his work as a Bugle reporter, a situation made much worse when the criminal Hobgoblin (Roderick Kingsley) secretly brainwashed Ned into acting as his accomplice and occasional stand-in. Ned became increasingly angry, violent and unstable. Betty began cheating on him with old friend Flash Thompson, prompting Ned to frame Flash for Hobgoblin's crimes. When Flash broke out of jail and sought refuge with Betty, Ned-as-Hobgoblin attacked Flash, and Betty saw Ned unmasked during the struggle. By this time, Kingsley had come to regard Leeds as a liability, and leaked word of Ned's double identity to the underworld. Hobgoblin's criminal rival Jack O' Lantern (Jason Macendale) hired the Foreigner to kill Ned, who was murdered by the Foreigner's agents. Macendale would adopt Ned's gear to become the new Hobgoblin, though he would eventually be murdered by Kingsley. Betty, already reeling from the revelation of Ned's double life, had a complete breakdown after Ned's death. She became delusional and prone to hallucinations. The broken Betty was easy prey for the Students of Love, a cult of brainwashed pawns led by the charismatic Teacher, a charlatan and supposed faith healer who stripped his followers of all their possessions. Spider-Man, Flash and Reverend Tolliver joined forces to free Betty, and the cult was destroyed in a fire. Deprogrammed and restored to relative mental health by Tolliver, but having lost all her belongings to the cult, Betty moved in with Flash. She reached a turning point during the demonic invasion of New York known as Inferno, when demons posing as Spider-Man and the late Ned attacked Flash's home; Betty found new inner strength and used it to save herself and Thompson from the demons, though Thompson's home was destroyed in the process. Later, when the emotion-controlling villain Mister Fear (Alan Fagan) tried to manipulate Betty into killing Spider-Man, she resisted and helped defeat Fagan; in the process, she began to understand and overcome the fear of loneliness at the root of her desperate attachments to the men in her life. Betty and Flash drifted apart, and Betty began a long process of radically reinventing herself. Easing out of secretarial work and into reporting, Brant became an investigative journalist for the Bugle, eventually tracking the killers of her husband. Studying martial arts and marksmanship, a heavily-armed Betty even managed to hold her own against the Foreigner's forces alongside Spider-Man, uncovering more details regarding the circumstances of Ned's death in the process. Less successful was her investigation of the Façade affair, during which the high-tech F.A.C.A.D.E. battle armor was stolen and used to murder Betty's colleague, Bugle photographer Lance Bannon. Working together, Spider-Man and Betty managed to defeat F.A.C.A.D.E., wrecking the armor, but its wearer escaped and was never identified (though one of the suspects, industrialist Archer Bryce, managed to arouse a romantic as well as professional interest in Betty). Nothing ever came of the Brant-Bryce attraction, though, nor did Flash succeed in his attempts to rekindle their romance at that time. Betty had a brief romantic interest in Ben Reilly, who was murdered by the Green Goblin. Betty continues to work at the Bugle under the direction of her longtime bosses, Jameson and editor-in-chief Joe \"Robbie\" Robertson. Her notable friends and colleagues there have included secretary Glory Grant (who took over Betty's old job), city editor Kathyrn \"Kate\" Cushing and fellow reporters such as Ben Urich, Joy Mercado, Jessica Jones and young Kat Farrell, whom Betty has mentored to some extent. Brant's investigative reporting has helped crack a number of important criminal cases over the years. Her greatest and most personal triumph was exposing businessman Roderick Kingsley as the true Hobgoblin, finally clearing Ned's name in the process.In the aftermath of Peter Parker publicly revealing his secret identity as Spider-Man, Betty proved herself to be a faithful, understanding and supportive friend to Peter. Betty  came to Spider-Man's aid in battle against his supernatural counter-point, Evo. Betty and Flash have renewed their romantic interest in each other.",

Refusing offers to Paris, Milan, and London, she instead wanted to use her powers as a force for good. Crawford is a flamboyant and bawdy brawler in the field, inventive in the use of her mutant powers. Crawford's group, formerly known as Great Lakes Avengers, recently complied with a cease-and-desist order to stop infringing on the Avengers franchise, which led to the group's present name. At one point, Crawford and her teammates assisted S.H.I.E.L.D. in an attempt to apprehend the then-fugitive Thunderbolts in the Colorado Rockies, in an operation led by Colonel G.W. Bridge. Although the operation ultimately failed, it displayed Crawford's willingness to support law enforcement agencies. Crawford's stance on the mutant question is unknown, but it would appear that she is more concerned with balancing her conflicting supermodel/superhero careers than with the global conflict between humans and mutants.In fact, she recently suffered a crisis of conscience after the team’s member Dinah Soar died during a mission. She briefly considered leaving the team and pursuing her modeling career, but she came to realize that she liked being with a group who could look past her outward appearance, both good or bad. She returned to help the team against Maelstrom and, later, the return of Doctor Tannenbaum.Now called the Great Lakes Champions after winning the title in a poker tournament hosted by the Thing, the team recently encountered Deadpool after becoming officially-sanctioned heroes due to the Civil War|Superhuman Registration Act.",

      "biography": "Jackson Weele was a New York businessman who had embezzled from his company. Fearing that he might be caught, he hired the youthful criminal Rocket Racer to steal the evidence that incriminated him. Rocket Racer did so, but then opted to use the evidence to blackmail Weele. Despairing, Weele tried to commit suicide, but Rocket Racer prevented him from doing so. However, Racer was not particularly kind to Weele, disparagingly referring to him as \"Big Weele\". Humiliated by Rocket Racer's taunts, Weele visited the mechanical genius and underworld supplier the Tinkerer. Rocket Racer had boasted that the Tinkerer had upgraded his equipment, so Weele figured that he would be a good choice to give him the tools to combat Rocket Racer. At Weele's urging, the Tinkerer created a large metal single-wheeled vehicle that can climb up buildings, equipping it with guns and waldo-arms. With this new vehicle, the Weele became the supervillain \"Big Wheel.\"Newly empowered, Big Wheel hunted down Rocket Racer and chased him across New York. In the process, he ended encountering and fighting Spider-Man. Spider-Man was also seeking Rocket Racer, whom he had battled previously. Unfortunately, Weele lacked practice in using his new vehicle and, in the heat of battle, Big Wheel toppled off a high rooftop and plunged into the Hudson River. Spider-Man tried to save him, but came up empty-handed. He presumed that Jackson Weele died when the Big Wheel vehicle sank to the bottom of the river.However, Weele turned up again with his Big Wheel many years later. Spider-Man was in combat with Stilt-Man when Big Wheel saw them. This time, Big Wheel attempted to help Spider-Man. However, due to Weele's interference, Stilt-Man escaped. Confronted by Spider-man, Weele revealed that, in the interim since their last meeting, he went to jail for embezzlement and has joined Vil-Anon (an analog of Alcoholics Anonymous but for super-villains). In fact, his attempt to help the hero was part of his twelve-step program. Out of pity, Spider-man let Big Wheel accompany him for the rest of of the day. While foiling a bank robbery, the pair confronted the Shocker. Although they defeated him, Jackson Weele finally realized that he is not cut out for super-heroics. He now makes his living using his Big Wheel rig in demolition derbies and speaking at events for Vil-Anon.Big Wheel gave up his retirement for a big payday when asked to join a group of villains seeking to eliminate the Ghost Rider. Partnered with Trull, he barreled over an unsuspecting Daniel Ketch as his brother Johnny Blaze watched in horror. The two men transformed into Ghost Rider and gave chase, but Weele managed to knock one over a bridge - evening out the competition. He was enjoying himself so much, he underestimated the power of the Ghost Rider and thought to crush him in a game of chicken. Blaze's motorcycle tore through Big Wheel like tissue paper, and Jackson found himself on the receiving end of a Penance Stare.",

      "biography": "Lucas Bishop was born in the 21st Century A.D. of an alternate future timeline in which the mutant-hunting robot Sentinels had taken control of North America. In this timeline, Professor Charles Xavier and most of the members of the mutant team he founded, the X-Men, had been killed. Surviving mutants were hunted down and either killed or imprisoned within relocation camps.Bishop's parents escaped to America shortly before the island nation of Australia was destroyed in a tactical nuclear strike. They were soon captured and interred in a mutant relocation camp in Sheep's Head Bay, Brooklyn, New York. There, Bishop and his sister Shard were both born and, like other mutants, they were branded with \"M\" tattoos over their right eyes for identification.Eventually, humans and mutants joined forces and overthrew the Sentinels in what became known as the Summers Rebellion. However, humans still resisted coexistence with mutants, and radical terrorist groups of mutants, such as the Exhumes, made war on humans. One of the veterans of the Summers Rebellion, a mutant named Hecat'e, stated that it was unacceptable for humans to hunt down criminal mutants, believing mutants should police themselves. Thus Hecat'e and other mutant veterans formed the Xavier Security Enforcers, named after Charles Xavier in honor of his dream of peaceful coexistence between mutants and humans.After the death of their parents, Bishop and Shard lived with their grandmother, who was herself a mutant. She told them stories about the heroism of the X-Men and instructed them to follow Xavier's dream of peace between mutants and the rest of humanity. One day, when Bishop and Shard were both still children, two X.S.E. members were pursuing Virago, a member of the Exhumes. Virago was about to murder Bishop when one X.S.E. member shot her dead. Until then, Bishop had regarded the X.S.E. as his enemies and the Exhumes as heroes, but from then on he wanted to join the X.S.E.Later, Bishop and Shard were attacked by criminal mutants.  Bishop attempted to save his sister from them, but it was two members of the X.S.E. who stopped the criminals.  Impressed by Bishop, the X.S.E. members offered Bishop a position in the organization. Bishop accepted on the condition that Shard be accepted in the X.S.E. as well. Thus Bishop and Shard became cadets at the X.S.E. Academy under Hecat'e's supervision. Among the other members of their class was a mutant named Trevor Fitzroy.Bishop and Shard eventually graduated from the Academy and became officers of the X.S.E. Shard, however, became Bishop's commanding officer. Bishop contented himself with a lower rank so that he could work the streets as a homicide policeman alongside his friends and fellow X.S.E. officers, Malcolm and Randall.Fitzroy eventually turned criminal and was imprisoned, but escaped with other mutant criminals through a portal to the X-Men's own time. Bishop, Malcolm, and Randall followed, even though they were aware they had no means to return to their own time. Stranded in the past, the trio tracked their mark into the midst of a fray between the X-Men and the Sentinels. Confronted with the legends of his youth, Bishop's first reaction was one of disbelief. Ultimately, Bishop's troops were slain by Fitzroy's forces during the deadly firefight. Only through the X-Men's intervention did the badly injured Bishop survive.Finally coming to terms with his time-tossed situation, Bishop was honored when Professor X invited him to join the team whose members he had idolized since childhood. Bishop found new purpose with the X-Men, fighting alongside the mutant adventurers to avert the genetic war that for him was history. Initially uneasy with Bishop's presence, the X-Men soon came to realize he was a devoted disciple of Xavier's philosophy, albeit an oft-times over-zealous one.During his time with the X-Men, Bishop proved instrumental in returning the timeline to normal after it was twisted by Legion, the mutant son of Professor X, who had traveled into the past to kill Magneto but had inadvertently killed his father instead.  Bishop also saved the lives of his teammates from the malevolent psionic entity known as Onslaught.  In his own time, Bishop had learned of a traitor in the ranks of the X-Men who would ultimately cause their death.  For a time he believed it to be Gambit, but after it was revealed that the traitor was none other than Professor X himself, albeit as Onslaught, Bishop was able to intervene and stop Onslaught from killing the X-Men by absorbing the energies of a massive psychic blast.After the X-Men were separated whilst returning to Earth following a mission in deep space, Bishop was severely injured. He was cared for by the alien Deathbird, who wished to use Bishop in an attempt to claim the throne of the intergalactic Shi'ar Empire from her sister, Lilandra. After a few interstellar adventures, including one to an alternate Earth ruled by the Shi'ar, Bishop managed to return to Earth and the X-Men.Plagued by reoccurring nightmares of Fitzroy, Bishop resigned from the X-Men to dedicate himself once more to the pursuit of his arch-nemesis. Drawn by the villain into another possible apocalyptic future, Bishop learned that his failure to act against Fitzroy had resulted in the criminal taking over this future world, wherein he had rechristened himself as the all-powerful Chronomancer. Fitzroy planned to ascend to godhood by becoming one with the temporal energies that control all time. Aided by a young boy named Michael who had been drawn to the future with him, Bishop gathered a small group of mutants and focused them on a single goal: quashing Fitzroy's mad plan.During the epic battle that followed a trek across the strange new world, Bishop defeated Fitzroy moments before he could complete his mad quest. However, the price of victory was high: Bishop's sister, Shard, sacrificed her life so that her brother could put an end to Fitzroy. Mere moments after the war had been won, Filled with chronal energy, Bishop was ripped back through time.  Young Michael remained in the future, seemingly with no hope of returning home.Spiraling through time, Bishop emerged back in the present as he crashed into a Shi'ar space station in deep space. As it happened, Professor Xavier and his team of mutant Skrull students named Cadre K were searching the same station for Deathbird, the Shi'ar criminal who was apparently Bishop's chronal anchor in the present day. A pan-galactic committee had transformed Earth into an intergalactic prison planet, and Deathbird held a key to penetrate the energy barrier that surrounded Earth. Bishop almost killed Deathbird before she opened an airlock and blew herself into the vacuum of space unprotected. After forming a plan with Professor X, Bishop allowed himself to be captured by the galactic committee and sent to Earth where he was quickly reunited with the X-Men. Then, alongside members of the Avengers, the X-Men helped liberate Earth.Soon after, Bishop and five other X-Men formed a splinter group of X-Men, cutting all ties with the rest of the team whilst searching for the Diaries of the late blind mutant seer named Destiny. The team later took on the responsibility of acting as a mutant peacekeeping force, setting them on the path to become the X.S.E. of Bishop's own time. After defeating the mutant predator known as Elias Bogan, the X-Treme X-Men returned to Westchester to help rebuild the mansion following an attack by Magneto. With Professor X having left for Genosha, the X-Men were forced to restructure and the X-Treme team disbanded to rejoin their comrades.Later, when crime in the borough of New York known as Mutant Town proved more than the N.Y.P.D. could handle, Bishop was called in to help police the region, referred to as District X.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      When the events of M-Day, caused by the reality warping mutant, Wanda Maximoff (The Scarlet Witch), Bishop retained no memory of it. And when she almost wiped out the mutant X-gene, making mutants border on extinction, Bishop was one of those few who was unaffected by it. After this the government of the United States declared Xavier's school to be a mutant sanctuary where the last mutants could live undisturbed. The X-Men however, had no say in the matter as Sentinels surrounded it to \"protect\" it. Bishop was one of the only mutants on campus who favoured their presence, and got on very well with Dr. Val Cooper, who was the commander of the O.N.E Sentinel squad.  \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              But when Civil War broke out and the X-Men in general remained neutral, Bishop was one of the few mutants to register with the government, causing a rift between him and many of the X-Men who, while neutral, felt that registration was wrong. However, Bishop was only doing this in an effort to prevent the monstrous future that he came from.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   After Civil War, Bishop participated in many of the unregistered superhuman round-ups. He continued to do this until he recieved word that the first mutant to be born since m-day was just born and both the acolytes and Cable were pursuing it. Believing this to be the young mutant who caused his horrific future, Bishop set off in search of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Bishop was relentless in his quest to find the baby. When he learned that Cable had the baby and was heading to Forge for a time machine, Bishop beat him there, wounded and/or killed Forge and shot Cable when he arrived. But just as he was about to kill the child, the Acolytes broke in, and took the baby from Bishop. Bishop then fooled the X-Men into thinking that he wanted to save the baby so that he could have some distractions for the Acolytes, giving him time to kill the baby. But his plan hits a snag when Madrox, a.k.a Multiple Man, wakes up from his trip with Layla, the memory restoring mutant from House of M, to Bishop's future. He reveals that Bishop believes that the mutant baby to be the cause of his awful childhood and that he will try to kill it. But with Bishop and the X-Men accompanying him on radio silent, the other X-Men fly out to stop him. Ultimately, Cable and the other X-Men get the baby with Proffesor Xavier's help. And as Cable faded away, going to the future, Bishop shoots his fading form. The bullet, however, goes through the shape and hits Xavier between the eyes, seemingly killing him. Cycops then hits Bishop with an optic blast, stopping him once and for all.",

However, as India’s telecommunications industry increased, so did the signals that Bashur received. He was saved from madness by Charles Xavier, who taught Bashur a measure of control. After learning of Bashur’s desire to control all information, Xavier broke contact. As Commcast, Bashur joined mercenaries Makeshift and Rive in forming the Executive Elite. Learning the secret of cloning, Bashur made copies of himself and his teammates, but a problem with the process ultimately prevented further duplication, leaving him one last ancillary body.During the search for the will of the arms dealer Tolliver, the mercenary Nyko hired the Executive Elite to kill Deadpool. Bashur sent clones, but they failed and were killed. Later, Bashur declined an assignment to oppose Sabretooth, instead having him ambushed by the Silver Samurai. Bashur was considered by Xavier as a means of recovering lost computer files. Later still, Bashur was contacted by the V-Battalion’s Roger Aubrey to locate operative Dallas Riordan, who was lost in Latveria. Bashur ultimately reinvented himself as the Black Box, an armored font of knowledge for ne’er-do-wells seeking information. Employing a network of thousands of “Think Links” (paid information gatherers), Bashur operated under the corporate front of Infonet, Inc. When Deadpool sought to cure his deteriorating mental condition, he approached Bashur for help, not knowing Bashur was his old foe Commcast. Bashur brainwashed Deadpool and sent him to kill Cable, but Cable and the mutant technosmith Forge de-programmed Deadpool. Cable’s allies in X-Force went to confront Bashur, but discovered only an empty suit of armor.Recently, Bashur sought the Dominus Objective, a computer hard-drive that, when linked to another system, processes all stored information and channels it to a recipient. Bashur hired the Cat (Shen Kuei) to steal it; however, the Cat was reluctant to accept until paid by Cable to take the assignment. Cable also secretly hired Deadpool and the mercenary B.A.D. Girls, Inc. to steal it in the unlikely event the Cat failed. Succeeding, the Cat delivered the drive to Bashur who interfaced with it, granting him control of all the information stored electronically in the world. Cable and Deadpool confronted Bashur, who attempted to “drown” them in a data stream; however, Cable’s telepathic powers allowed him to shrug off the assault. Tapping into Bashur’s powers, Cable revealed the future to him; Bashur then agreed to work for Cable, to help prepare mankind for what is to come.",

Blaming crime lord Wilson Fisk, the Kingpin of Crime, Felicia vowed to destroy him. Fifteen years later, the adult Felicia became an accountant for Fisk Enterprises, but spent her nights robbing Manhattan’s more prominent office buildings as the costumed Black Cat. When Mr. Moore offered to buy his way into the Kingpin’s organization with an inscribed stone tablet desired by Fisk, Felicia broke into Moore’s building, easily circumventing the security through a combination of skill and incredible luck, and stole the tablet from his office safe. On her way out, she encountered and battled Spider-Man; but despite his slightly greater agility, Spider-Man seemed plagued by bad luck, and she escaped. When video footage of their encounter made the news, police suspected they were partners in crime.Intrigued, the Cat placed an ad in the Bugle, arranging a meeting with Spider-Man on a rooftop near the site of their battle. She brought Spider-Man wine and cheese and flirted with him, but their romantic reunion was interrupted by Elektra, who had been hired to retrieve the tablet. The Cat and Elektra battled, with the assassin gradually gaining the upper hand. Trying to calm the situation, Spider-Man webbed the Cat while he tried to talk to Elektra, who knocked him off the building; while the others were distracted, the Cat freed herself and made her escape.Remembering comments the Cat had made to Elektra to tell the Kingpin she was not her father, Spider-Man searched Daily Bugle records and figured out her identity. Realizing that if he could work this out, so could the Kingpin, he raced to Felicia’s apartment, finding her literally in the crime lord’s grasp. The hero’s arrival allowed Felicia to break free, and she fled to the roof of her apartment building; as the Kingpin and Elektra arrived in pursuit, she threw the tablet into the harbor. Elektra immediately threw a Sai into Felicia’s chest, and she fell from the roof into the sea, apparently dead; however, several months later, she returned to aid Spider-Man during the inter-gang war between the forces of Kingpin and Hammerhead.",

      "biography": "Nephew of the villainous Black Knight that went by the name of Nathan Garrett, Dane was summoned by his uncle when he was mortally wounded following a battle with Iron Man. With his last words his uncle confessed to his life of crime, and bid Dane to restore the honor of the Black Knight legacy.\n\nAt first, Dane hoped to use merely his scientific expertise to be a force for good. However, his scientific experiments using magnetism to search for extraterrestrial life inadvertently brought Magneto and Toad back to Earth during a time when the mutant villains were believed lost in space. Magneto immediately began to re-form his Brotherhood, starting by kidnapping Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch. Whitman donned the costume and weapons of the Black Knight to track Magneto down but was confronted by the Avengers, who assumed him to be his uncle. The Black Knight helped the Avengers get on the right track but parted company with them, annoyed by their distrust.\n\nNathan Garrett was posthumously contacted to join the Masters of Evil organized by the Crimson Cowl (actually, the robot Ultron, who was unaware of the villainous Knight's demise.) Whitman agreed to join the team with the hopes of infiltrating their ranks, and he tried to contact the Avengers before the attack. However, Ultron guessed at Whitman’s treachery, and the Masters intercepted him, beating him and leaving him abandoned. The Black Knight happened upon the discarded Jarvis, who was also abandoned by the Masters after being set-up to appear as if he were the Crimson Cowl. The Black Knight tracked down the Masters of Evil, helping the Avengers escape and overcome their foes. The heroes then parted on better terms, although Whitman still wanted to keep his distance.\n\nWhitman traveled to England hoping to sell the last of his inheritance from his uncle - Garrett Castle. There, he was contacted by the spirit of his ancestor Sir Percy of Scandia, the original Black Knight, in a similar way that his uncle had. However, in this case, Whitman proved worthy of pulling the Ebony Blade out of its scabbard. With it, he defeated the demonic guardian of the sword and, afterward, Le Sabre, a modern-day agent of Sir Percy’s enemy, Mordred.\n\nReturning to America, the Black Knight met Doctor Strange through their mutual contact of Victoria Bentley. The two began working together, once against Tiboro and once, with the Avengers, against Surtur and Ymir.\n\nHe encountered the Avengers again when they used as pawns by Kang in playing a game with the Grandmaster and his Squadron Sinister. His Ebony Blade was the prize in a contest between Goliath (Clint Barton) and the Whizzer, but by trying to help Goliath, the Black Knight interfered with the game and the Avengers, with his Ebony Blade, were returned to Kang’s future. Thanks to the mystic properties of the sword, the Black Knight was able to transport himself to it, despite the distance of space and time. He helped the heroes escape and confront Kang, who demanded power from the Grandmaster to defeat the Avengers. Ultimately, it was the Black Knight, since he was not an Avenger, who managed to strike Kang down and allow them to return to the present. In gratitude, the Avengers extended an offer of membership, and Whitman accepted, although he opted for reserve status since he resided in England at the time in Garrett Castle.\n\nOver time, Whitman began feeling the curse of the Ebony Blade making him grow more violent, more bloodthirsty. When he nearly killed two jewel thieves after a pursuit, he sought to end the curse by destroying the blade. The search brought him to the magical dimension of Polemachus, but he was captured by Arkon and his erstwhile ally, the Enchantress. The Enchantress placed the Black Knight under a spell, keeping him in thrall even when the Avengers, warned of the Knight’s fate by the Scarlet Witch’s dream, came to rescue him. The Enchantress urged Arkon to battle the Avengers in hopes they would be destroyed, but the Black Knight lost his sword during the fight, and it fell into a magical well and was seemingly destroyed. Convinced of the truth, Arkon abandoned the Enchantress and the fight, allowing the Avengers and the Knight to return home.\n\nIn fact, the blade was not destroyed but was lost in time, appearing in Olympus. Ares discovered it and, allying with the Enchantress who was following the blade, launched an assault upon Olympus. The Black Knight learned of this through the Brazier of Truth, and assembled the Avengers to storm the halls of Olympus. Ultimately, the Avengers were successful in stopping Ares’ rampage, recovering the Ebony Blade, and remanding the Enchantress to Zeus. She soon escaped, however, and sought out the Black Knight to use as her pawn, once more placing him under her spell with a kiss. They traveled to the dimension ruled by Casiolena, and the Enchantress sought revenge against her and the Executioner, who deserted her for Casiolena. The Defenders took refuge at Garrett Castle after rescuing Barbara Norriss from the Nameless One, and inadvertently stumbled into Casiolena’s dimension. The Enchantress transformed Barbara Norriss into the Valkyrie in order to aid her cause, and the Defenders were forced into battle as well. When Casiolena was defeated, the Enchantress and Executioner fled, but not before the witch cast the Black Knight aside, transforming him into stone. During this time, Valkyrie used his winged horse, Aragorn.\n\nDoctor Strange took the Black Knight’s body with him to his Sanctum Sanctorum, hoping to someday reverse the curse. Eventually, Strange managed to contact the Black Knight’s spirit, lost in a nameless dimension, but the message was warped by Dormammu to force the Defenders and the Avengers to compete for the Evil Eye, a powerful mystic object that Strange was led to believe would be the Knight’s only salvation. In fact, Dormammu succeeded in using the Eye to nearly destroy the universe before being defeated, and the Eye couldn’t help the Black Knight, as his spirit had traveled to the Twelfth Century during the time of the Crusades.\n\nThrough a spell cast at the time of Camelot’s demise by Merlin, Whitman’s spirit inhabited the body of his ancestor, Eobar Garrington, also known as the Black Knight. Whitman was thus able to try to track down Modred the Evil, the man who murdered Garrington. Modred had died centuries before but lived on as his spirit survived in the Twelfth Century, throwing events into chaos. Merlin’s spell also brought the Defenders, who helped the Knight confront Modred, his allies, and his armies. Ultimately, Whitman decided to stay in the past, fighting in the Crusades on behalf of King Richard, and the Defenders returned home.\n\nAt some point following the Crusades, the Black Knight joined the High Druid of Avalon, Amergin, in defending the realm of Avalon from attack by the Fomor, ancestral enemies of the English gods who wished to use Avalon to invade Earth. At the Knight’s suggestion, Amergin used his modern-day descendant, Doctor Druid, to elicit the Avengers’ aid. They hoped to use the Evil Eye to absorb enough energy to close the portal between Avalon and Earth, but it was the Black Knight who was forced to use the Eye, destroying his body in the process. Doctor Druid returned the Avengers to present-day Earth, and with his last vestiges of power, restored the stone body of Dane Whitman and transformed him back into flesh. He soon found a new steed in the winged horse, Valinor.\n\nThe Black Knight tried to settle back into modern-day life, although much had changed in his absence. Victoria Bentley became the caretaker of Garrett Castle, purchasing it herself during Dane's years in the Crusades to prevent the British government from seizing the property for failure to pay taxes. He also took a young Irish orphan, Sean Dolan, under his wing, becoming a guardian and mentor. However, over time, Whitman began experiencing increasing madness and bloodthirstiness. Doctor Strange revealed that the Ebony Blade had been cursed by its original owner, Sir Percy of Scandia, by spilling blood when he was in possession of the blade. Doctor Strange contacted and appealed to Sir Percy's spirit, allowing it to reside in the blade, and thereby removed the curse, warning Whitman not to inflict the sword with any curses of his own. During this time, Valinor had lost his wings and was retired.\n\nThe Black Knight returned to America, where he took on full active membership again. During this time, he began riding a mechanical \"Atomic Steed\" for his mount. He also developed a romantic crush on his fellow Avenger, the Wasp, but she didn't share Dane's feelings and he was soon forced to abandon his intentions. He did, however, became romantically interested in his admirer, the female Yellowjacket.\n\nSometime later, his personality seemed to grow more medieval and archaic. When the Avengers' associate, Marrina, underwent her own transformation into a huge savage sea creature resembling the mythical Leviathan, she began sinking several fleets of ships and ravaging the undersea world of Atlantis. The Avengers hunted her down, but ultimately it was her husband, the Sub-Mariner, who took Whitman's Ebony Blade from him and dealt a mortal blow to Marrina. Whitman immediately felt the effects of the blood-curse on the blade, which took the effect of slowly transforming him into a living extension of his Ebony Blade. As such, he began to cut the people and objects he touched and gradually found it harder to move.\n\nThe Black Knight was forced to leave the Avengers in the company of his teammate Thor, who hoped to find a cure for Whitman's condition in the realm of Asgard. However, at the time Asgard became embroiled in a battle against the Egyptian death god Seth and his army. Ultimately, Thor used the Knight's cursed, blade-like body to kill Seth. Thor then took the Knight’s body back to Earth, placing it in the care of Doctor Strange. Dane Whitman was restored to normal through the combined efforts of Doctor Strange, his friends Victoria Bentley and Sean Dolan, and the spirit of Sir Percy.\n\nThe Black Knight soon returned to the Avengers, having abandoned his Ebony Blade in favor of a high-tech laser sword. More determined and driven than before, the Knight grew into one of the Avengers' most prominent members, even serving as unofficial field leader under the Black Widow. His drive in the Avengers led him to become more ruthless than before, even to the point of advocating the assassination of the alien Supreme Intelligence for its role in sparking war between the Kree and Shi'ar alien races. Also, Whitman began neglecting Valinor, his squire Dolan, and his benefactor Victoria Bentley.\n\nSean Dolan later used the Ebony Blade, becoming possessed by it and being transformed into the demonic Bloodwraith, killing Victoria Bentley and stealing Valinor for himself. More poignantly, Whitman and Bentley had just begun to entertain a potential romance before her death. Dane defeated the Bloodwraith, but Dolan escaped, becoming one of Whitman's most bitter foes.\n\nThe Black Knight soon found himself in a love triangle involving himself and two of his teammates, the Inhuman, Crystal, and the Eternal, Sersi. Dane was in love with Crystal, the estranged wife of Quicksilver, but was also strongly attracted to the mentally unstable Sersi, who was madly in love with him and forced Dane to mentally bond with her. When Quicksilver returned to the group and seemed prepared to reconcile with Crystal, Dane unselfishly renounced his feelings for her. About the same time, the Avengers were attacked by Whitman's counterpart from another dimension, the Proctor, who was determined to kill Sersi in revenge for what her counterpart had done to him, including the mental-bonding process. The Black Knight helped defeat the Proctor and resigned himself to accompany Sersi in her exile to another dimension as her growing mental instability made her too dangerous to remain on Earth.\n\nDuring their adventures in other dimensions, Sersi regained her emotional stability and Dane spent some time with a super-team called Ultraforce, even becoming its leader. He and Sersi eventually decided to return to their own Earth, though, and managed to do so after an accidental side trip to the Crusades, during which Dane earned the friendship and enmity of Bennet du Paris, a power-mad knight who survived into modern times as the mutant terrorist Exodus, leader of the Acolytes. On returning to present-day Earth, Dane and Sersi split up. The Avengers were temporarily disbanded at the time, so the Black Knight found a new home and new employment at Oracle Incorporated, joining the company's new super-team, Heroes for Hire. At about the same time, Dane was contacted by the Lady of the Lake, who informed him that he was fated to be the champion of Avalon, the mystical Celtic realm the Black Knight had been allied with during his time in the Twelfth Century. The Lady of the Lake gave the Knight a new magical winged steed and mystical weapons to better battle evil in Avalon's name.\n\nThe Black Knight continued to battle evil as a member of Heroes for Hire and as an inactive member of the Avengers, until Heroes for Hire’s disbanding. In one of the team’s final missions, they encountered on Mt. Wundagore the humanoid animals created by the High Evolutionary. The Black Knight elected to stay on Wundagore to lead these \"New Men\" as the Knights of Wundagore.\n\nThe Black Knight later broke away from the New Men in order to join his fellow Avengers in various adventures. One such adventure brought the Black Knight to the country of Slorenia, where the Bloodwraith was ravaging the land. The Knight hoped to remain near Slorenia to finally defeat the Bloodwraith, but he rejoined the Avengers during their war against Kang, who nearly succeeded in conquering Earth. The Black Knight parted company with the Avengers yet again after the battle with Kang was over. Recently, Black Knight joined MI-13.",

      "biography": "A descendant of Sir Percy of Scandia, the original Black Knight from Medieval times, Nathan Garrett inherited Garrett Castle, the final resting place of Sir Percy. There, the spirit of Sir Percy appeared to him, charging him with becoming a modern-day crusader for good as a new Black Knight. However, Nathan proved unworthy and could not draw Sir Percy’s enchanted Ebony Blade. At some point, Nathan Garrett had become a Communist spy for the People’s Republic of China. He left his teaching position at Oxford University and became a U.S. citizen working for a research lab. He was also head of an espionage ring, selling American scientific secrets to China, until he was captured by Giant-Man (Henry Pym). He managed to flee to an undisclosed location in the Balkans where he decided to become the Black Knight, albeit one for criminal gain. With his new costume and weapons, he returned to America, but his first attempt at a robbery was thwarted by Giant-man, and he escaped again. The Black Knight was contacted by Baron Heinrich Zemo to help form the original Masters of Evil as a counterpart for the Avengers’ Giant-Man. However, Zemo’s plan, to defeat the Avengers and hold New York in thrall, failed, because the Avengers switched up opponents and the Black Knight was beaten by Thor. He escaped prison once to battle Iron Man, but he was defeated and remanded to custody again. Broken out of prison by the Enchantress and the Executioner, he joined another version of the Masters of Evil, but was again defeated by the Avengers.The Black Knight again tried to focus his efforts on defeating Iron Man by kidnapping Tony Stark’s friend Happy Hogan and holding him in a castle that was reconstructed in Washington D.C. The Knight actually succeeded in defeating Iron Man by disrupting the circuitry of his armor, and he flew with him into the sky, hoping to drop him from a great height. Instead, Iron Man managed to unhorse the Knight and they both fell. Iron Man’s armor recovered enough to fly him to safety, but the Black Knight was believed to have perished in the fall.  On his deathbed, the Black Knight reached out to his only living relative, Dane Whitman, and revealed the truth about his secret identity. Full of regret, he charged his nephew with using his weapons and technology for good instead of evil. Nathan Garrett died, but Dane Whitman fulfilled his promise by becoming the heroic Black Knight. Years later, Nathan Garrett was resurrected by Immortus as a part of his Legion of the Unliving. Immortus pitted the Legion against the Avengers as he hoped to enslave the Scarlet Witch and thus control time itself. The Black Knight was a merciless version of himself, but he was nonetheless defeated along with the others on his team. He was seen again as a member of another Legion of the Unliving, resurrected by the Grim Reaper into the body of a plane crash victim. The Legion, little more than violent, mindless zombies, battled the Avengers on behalf of the Reaper, who was seeking revenge on the Avengers for supposedly killing him. When confronted with the truth of his own suicide, the Reaper lost control over the souls of the Legion, which returned to the afterlife, and succumbed to the demon, Lliogoroth, who was feeding him power.",

      "biography": "Sir Percy of Scandia was born at the castle of King Arthur Pendragon in England during the first years of Arthur’s reign in the sixth century. Sir Percy adopted the guise of the Black Knight in order to serve his king in a dual capacity: One, an unassuming man of the royal court, and the other, a mysterious avenging champion. King Arthur's court magician, Merlin, gave Percy the Ebony Blade after enchanting it himself.As the Black Knight, Sir Percy's greatest foe was King Artur’s nephew Mordred. For years, Percy tried to gather evidence of Mordred's treachery, to no avail. Soon after the fall of Camelot, the wounded Mordred dispatched his men to ambush the Black Knight using a dagger constructed of the same meteoric ore as the Ebony Blade. Sir Percy was slain, but Merlin, however, cast a spell upon Percy's spirit, enabling it to return to the earthly plane when the spirit of Mordred threatened the world again.  Percy’s spirit was also able to return by means of a magical brazier. It returned to offer the Ebony Blade to his descendants, but only one, Dane Whitman, proved a worthy heir to the magic sword. Dane would occasionally consult the brazier for advice, such as when he needed to find where the Ebony Blade had become lost in time, finding it finally in Olympus.Years later, when Dane Whitman had fallen victim to the Blade's curse, the sorcerer supreme, Doctor Strange, appealed to Sir Percy's spirit, allowing it to reside in the blade, thinking this would end the curse. The effort freed Dane from his affliction, but the curse remained, later affecting Dane’s squire Sean Dolan, who became Bloodwraith. The final resting place of Percy’s spirit remains a mystery.",

      "biography": "For generations, the people of Wakanda have followed and worshipped the Black Panther, a superior warrior granted extra abilities by the Panther God upon proving him or herself worthy in a combat tournament open to all Wakandans.\n\nWakanda stands apart from many nations because of its advanced technological nature, well-integrated with centuries-old traditions. Intent on keeping to itself for generations, the nation often rebuked visitors while also refraining from interfering in larger world conflicts. Wakanda’s greatest natural resource, Vibranium, provides Wakanda both independence and technological superiority. The vibration-absorbing metal is cultivated in the Great Mound.\n\nFor much of the modern era, T’Challa has worn the mantle of the Black Panther, acting as both Wakanda'’ champion and its king. However, unlike many of his predecessors, T’Challa often eschewed his peoples’ insular nature and journeyed out into the world—masked and unmasked—to become a hero to the entire globe and beyond.\n\nA Royal Beginning\n\nBefore becoming the Panther, T’Challa was simply the son of Wakanda’s king T’Chaka, a previous Black Panther. Unfortunately, his father ran afoul of the Vibranium-obsessed Ulysses Klaw, who ultimately brought about the king’s death. T’Challa would travel the world and study at the best universities, a journey that also united him with Ororo Munroe, the young woman who would become Storm.\n\nUpon returning to his homeland, T’Challa secretly took part in the open challenge to the current Black Panther—his uncle S’Yan—and defeated him. Upon revealing his true identity, the country reacted first with shock and then adulation as he took his rightful place in the community.",

      "biography": "Allegedly for over 700 years, the title and powers of the Black Tarantula have been passed down from father to son. Each Black Tarantula supposedly separates the male heir from the mother at an early age to begin a life of vigorous training. The current Black Tarantula, Carlos LaMuerto, a crimelord in South America and parts of Europe, met his Brazilian wife, Marina Caches, while attending an American graduate school. They had a child, Fabian. Upon discovering her husband’s illegal activities, Marina filed for divorce and fled with her son. Marina settled in New York where she became a criminal psychology teacher at Empire State University and began dating Dante Rigoletto (unaware that Dante was the son of the infamous mobster, Don Rigoletto). Discovering his ex-wife to be in the New York area, the Black Tarantula launched a campaign primarily to locate his son while establishing a foothold in the lucrative New York underworld market in the absence of the Kingpin of Crime (Wilson Fisk). He dispatched his powerful agent, el Uno, with a gang of his men to violently introduce himself to his competition, the Rose (Jacob Conover). Humiliated by el Uno, the Rose’s assassin Delilah killed el Uno and returned his severed head to the Black Tarantula. The Black Tarantula dispatched Madam Qwa and the True Believers -- a Korean cult of ninjas who defected from the Hand -- to harass the Rose by killing a former colleague, Daily Bugle editor Joe Robertson, while framing the Rose. With opposition from the Hand ninjas, Spider-Man, and Elektra, the Black Tarantula’s agents failed to kill Robertson.The Black Tarantula went to New York to personally attend to matters. The Rose hired the remaining True Believers under Madam Qwa's brother, Master Zei, to resurrect Doctor Octopus as an ally. However Zei intended to turn Doctor Octopus over to the Black Tarantula, but was killed during the resurrection ceremony. As Madam Qwa demanded revenge, the Black Tarantula conceded, breaking Delilah's neck, then healing her with a stern warning for the Rose. Meanwhile, his diminutive loyal assistant, Chesbro, located Marina, who had been teaching Spider-Man’s wife, Mary Jane Watson-Parker. The Tarantula invaded Don Vincente Fortunato's mansion brokering a deal for portions of the Rose’s hijacking operations in exchange for sending a dire message to Spider-Man. Offering mercy only upon learning Spider-Man was searching to rescue a kidnapped child (Norman Osborn Jr.), the Tarantula beat Spider-Man nearly to death and departed with his mask. He offered the mask to Fortunato, who recounted his partially correct understanding of the legendary Black Tarantula's secret origin, beginning with Marco Polo's expeditions to the Orient. Peter Parker (in four alternate disguises while a bounty was on his head), tackled Black Tarantula's operatives, Bloodscream and Roughouse who had incapacitated Delilah while on assignment to kidnap Marina Caches. Marina fled to Dante's godfather, Don Fortunato, for protection. The Black Tarantula raided Fortunato's mansion, tearing through the mobster's defenses, and Killdroids. Spider-Man arrived and stopped the Rose from shooting the Black Tarantula in the back. Spider-Man's heroics, and his wife's pleading on behalf of Fabian persuaded the Black Tarantula to depart and return another day. The Black Tarantula fled during a raid on a Roxxon facility used to augment criminal agents with superhuman abilities located on his Bolivian jungle property.The Black Tarantula was incarcerated in the U.S. and kept depowered in Rykers prison along with Daredevil (Matthew Murdock), the Kingpin (Wilson Fisk), Hammerhead, and the Punisher (Frank Castle) where he was nearly killed by Bullseye.",

      "biography": "Born a mutant, Thomas Cassidy was the heir to his family’s fortune, including the estate of Cassidy Keep, a fortress-like castle in the sparsely populated coastal area of County Mayo. A charming Oxford-educated ladies’ man, Tom gambled his inheritance on a throw of dice, losing to his younger cousin Sean, who was also a mutant. The cousins subsequently vied for the love of Maeve Rourke, who dated both for months, seemingly torn between their affections. Ultimately she chose Sean as her escort for the university ball, but he was injured in a car accident en route and asked Tom to accompany Maeve in his stead. Unaware of Sean’s accident, Maeve was initially confused by his absence until Tom told her the truth. He realized her heart belonged to Sean and gave up his pursuit, serving as best man at their wedding. Having lost the love of his life, Tom turned to a life of crime, taking on the nom-de-guerre Black Tom. He initially masked his criminal activities under the guise of being a soldier of fortune, and roamed the world offering his services as a gun for hire while continuing to pursue his criminal activities. Captured and imprisoned after aiding revolutionary forces in a third world country, Tom met and befriended fellow mercenary Cain Marko.Meanwhile, Sean became an Interpol agent and was assigned to a top-secret mission that required him to stay out of contact with his family for a considerable time. As he left on his mission, Sean was unaware that Maeve was in her first month of pregnancy, and their daughter, Theresa, was born during his absence. While visiting relatives in Armagh, Northern Ireland, Maeve and Theresa were caught in a terrorist bombing. Maeve was killed, but the authorities could find no trace of Theresa and assumed she was also dead. Those who knew about Theresa sought to keep her existence from Sean to spare him further grief; however, Tom had been present at the scene of the explosion and secretly saved Theresa. When Sean returned and learned of Maeve’s death, he blamed Tom for not protecting her and lashed out with his mutant power, causing Tom to fall and break his leg. Bitter, Tom resolved to conceal the truth about Sean’s daughter and raised Theresa as his own. Tom sent Theresa to boarding school at age 12 to shield her from his criminal activities. Three years later, Tom was captured in an undercover operation led by Sean and was jailed for five years.Subsequently reunited with Marko, now the super-criminal Juggernaut, Tom suggested they form a criminal partnership. One of their earliest employers was the Shi’ar alien Eric the Red, who bade them destroy the X-Men, whom Sean had recently joined as Banshee. Tom’s hatred of his cousin and the Juggernaut’s longstanding feud with the X-Men’s founder, his step-brother Charles Xavier, spurred them to accept the job. The pair ambushed the X-Men at Cassidy Keep, which Sean had recently inherited, but were defeated with the aid of the Keep’s resident leprechauns. After Theresa’s mutant nature manifested during adolescence, Tom trained her to aid him in his criminal activities as the costumed Siryn, clashing with the X-Men and Spider-Woman. However, Theresa’s heart was never in a life of crime, and while briefly in the custody of legal authorities Tom exonerated her and wrote a letter to Sean explaining who she was, after which father and daughter were joyfully reunited. Subsequently, Tom sought to capture the psychic Madame Web to aid in his criminal endeavors. He sent Juggernaut to capture her, but Juggernaut was defeated by Spider-Man after the web-slinger trapped him in a 40 foot deep foundation of wet cement. Later, when his partner-in-crime presented him with the Ruby of Cyttorak as a gift, Tom gained half the Juggernaut’s power. This brought them into conflict with Spider-Man and the X-Men, but Tom ultimately lost this newfound power and they escaped.Later, Tom struck a deal with businesswoman Arianna Jankos, who sought help in opposing a hostile takeover of her company in exchange for locating a dimensionally-displaced Juggernaut. After the Juggernaut was returned, the pair interrupted the takeover meeting and took all present as hostages, including millionaire mutants Gideon and Sunspot. The mutant strike team X-Force intervened, but Tom set off explosives in the building. X-Force’s leader, Cable, subsequently shot Tom, causing him to fall. However, he was saved by Deadpool, whose employer, arms dealer Tolliver, had Tom taken to a genetic engineering research facility outside Angôuleme, France where the injured portions of Tom’s body were grafted with an experimental wood-like substance. The substance acted like a genetic virus that hindered his entire cellular structure, transforming an increased amount of his body. To help save Tom’s life, Juggernaut sought out Genetech, the company that pioneered the grafting process. To avoid Juggernaut’s usual mass destruction, the hero Thunderstrike got Juggernaut the information he required. After the Juggernaut forced his release from the research facility, Tom rejoined his old partner-in-crime on the hunt for Tolliver’s will, bringing them into conflict with Deadpool. Soon after, Juggernaut agreed to turn Tom over to the authorities in exchange for Tom receiving treatment to cure his condition. Learning of his cousin’s state, Sean arranged for geneticist Doctor Killebrew to treat him in prison. Freed by the Juggernaut, Tom captured Killebrew and learned that samples of Deadpool’s regenerating cells could cure him. Sending soldiers to obtain such a sample, Tom was caught unawares when Banshee and Siryn aided Deadpool against them. Still, one of the soldiers managed to return with Deadpool’s left hand, and, after amputating his own, Tom had Killebrew replace it with Deadpool’s. The cure initially worked; however, the new cells began taking over Tom’s entire body, endangering his life once more. After a confrontation with Deadpool, Banshee and Siryn, Juggernaut forced Killebrew to stabilize Tom’s condition, after which Banshee flew him to hospital.The virus soon began spreading once more, finally mutating Tom’s entire body into a plant-like state with vast new powers. Apparently, the virus had been engineered from spores of the sentient island creature Krakoa, whose residual psyche subsequently compelled Tom to capture most of Banshee’s students in Generation X and imprison them underwater in an organic bio-transport at Krakoa’s original location. In the ensuing clash, Tom was sliced apart by the razor-sharp claws of Banshee’s student Penance.  He survived, and after briefly asserting control of the virus to appear human once more, he sought the X-Men’s help twice: first to save Juggernaut’s life after his power was stolen by the Cult of Chejo-Do, and again to prevent Juggernaut from unwittingly destroying another dimension. Tom next menaced Banshee and Generation X anew alongside Juggernaut and Mondo. Following a failed assault on the X-Man Cyclops at the behest of the anti-mutant ex-soldier Ulysses, Tom succumbed to the virus once more and transformed back into a plant-like creature. Returning to Cassidy Keep, Tom captured the castle’s inhabitants and began draining their life force. Hoping to help his friend, Juggernaut contacted the X-Men for assistance but Tom captured them as well. With the help of their newest member, the pheromone-generating Stacy X, the X-Men freed themselves and the Juggernaut, and together they defeated Tom, who apparently drowned. Tom once again survived, and was later recruited by Magneto’s former Acolyte Exodus into a new incarnation of the Brotherhood of Mutants. Planning an assault on the Xavier Institute headquarters of the X-Men, the Brotherhood believed they had an ally in the Juggernaut, then an X-Man, whom Tom believed he had convinced to join the X-Men so as to betray them. However, when Tom brutally slew Juggernaut’s friend, young student Sammy Pare, the Juggernaut lashed out at Tom, revealing his true colors. Seemingly unstoppable, Tom rampaged through the Institute until the X-Man Xorn formed a black hole which swallowed up the Brotherhood, Tom included.After M-Day, Black Tom woke up as a human again, losing his secondary mutation but retaining his old powers, along with his sanity. The organization Black Air hired Tom to attack new Excalibur, of which Juggernaut was now a member. Though he easily defeated the others, Juggernaut confronted his former friend and convinced him to turn himself in for the death of Sammy.",

      "biography": "At age 15, Yelena was chosen as a candidate to become the new Black Widow, as Natasha Romanova was no longer loyal only to Russia. She trained for roughly a decade under Vasilievich Pyotr Starkovsky at the espionage academy known as the Red Room, the same facility in which Romanova had trained. Unbeknownst to Yelena, as she grew older, Starkovsky became obsessed with her, paying another woman, Petra, to don Yelena’s costume and satisfy his desires. Petra eventually became psychotic and killed Starkovsky. It was only after Yelena slew Petra and avenged her mentor that she truly accepted her role as the Black Widow.\n\nGraduating from the Red Room, Yelena became the first student to surpass Romanova’s marks. Eager to prove herself better than Natasha and establish sole claim to the title of Black Widow, Yelena interfered with Natasha’s quest for the \"Deathless Frenzy\" bio-weapon held by terrorist Col. Khan in Rhapastan. Yelena sought to secure the lethal serum for her superiors and to eliminate her adversary, but Natasha’s experience and superior planning enabled Natasha to outmaneuver her young opponent and complete the assignment in her own fashion, slaying Khan and destroying the entire supply of Deathless Frenzy. Yelena pulled a gun on Natasha, but decided to let her live so they could continue to vie for supremacy.\n\nWishing to teach Yelena a lesson, Natasha then worked with Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. on Operation: Validate, which entailed the two Widows exchanging physical appearances. While Yelena was struggling to maintain her identity, Natasha duped Yelena’s superior, Yuri Stalyenko, into revealing his plot to steal nuclear weapons hidden in Hudson  during the Cold War. Natasha also showed Yelena that Stalyenko thought of her as an expendable pawn, easily replaced. The two Widows teamed up to bring him down, but a resentful Yelena then attacked Natasha, who explained how she wanted to teach Yelena that espionage was not a game. S.H.I.E.L.D. reversed the process and Yelena returned to the Red Room a little wiser, though certainly no fonder of Natasha.\n\nAfter some considerable time, she was reinstated at S.H.I.E.L.D. and with the help of some rogue S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and the Savage Land Mutates, began work on an illegal Vibranium mining project located in the Savage Land. Realizing that the reformation of the Avengers was a threat to the operation, Yelena hired Electro to cause a prison break at the superhuman maximum security prison called the Vault in order to cause a distraction and reunite Sauron with his Savage Land Mutates. As the Avengers investigated the breakout further, they decided to hunt down Sauron, leading them to the Savage Land. Upon arriving they were beat down by the mutates, who bound them and revealed their part of the Vibranium operation. Controlling his armor remotely, Iron Man managed to free the Avengers. In a short skirmish that followed, the Avengers proceeded to defeat all of the mutates except Sauron. As Sauron was about to tell them about his part in the operation, Yelena used a sniper rifle and shot him in the head, seemingly killing him. Yelena and the rogue S.H.I.E.L.D. agents then proceeded to try to kill the Avengers, but were unsuccessful. As Yelena and Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew) squared off, a revived Sauron expelled fire from his mouth at Yelena which badly burned her body. Burned and beaten, she was taken to an undisclosed location where a mysterious figure offered to help her get revenge on the Avengers, which she agreed to do.\n\nWhile still hospitalized and brutally disfigured, the mysterious figure returned to Yelena and revealed he was a representative of Hydra. He brought with him agents from A.I.M., who perform an operation which transforms her into a being similar to that of the Super-Adaptoid. Now calling herself the Adaptoid, she set out toward the new Avengers Tower where she proceeded to copy the powers of all of the Avengers and eventually managed to get the upper hand in the battle. However, Spider-Man and Iron Man realized a way to neutralize her. After a few minutes of fighting the wall-crawler she was bombarded by dozens of Iron Man's suits which were remote-controlled by Tony Stark. Using this tactic, they managed to stop her. The Sentry then used telepathy to cause her to perceive that the Void was right in front of her and make her feel that it would haunt her forever unless she revealed who turned her into the Adaptoid. Elsewhere, realizing that Yelena would soon talk, the Hydra representative ordered her termination. Seconds later at Avengers Tower, Yelena was blown up from the inside, killing her instantly.",

      "biography": "Centuries of murder saturated the Christ's Crown area with evil until the attempted rape of a young girl named Sarah drew Mephisto to create a “son”, Blackheart, from the accumulated wrongs. Slaying both rapist and victim, Blackheart explored the nature of evil under his father's tutelage, clashing with and failing to corrupt Daredevil and Spider-Man. Mephisto and Blackheart soon drew Daredevil, Brandy Ash, the genetically engineered Number Nine, and Inhumans Gorgon, Karnak, and Ahura into Hell. Observing these mortals led Blackheart to rebel against his father and seek a newer form of evil; in retaliation, Mephisto diminished Blackheart’s powers. Focusing on those who walked the line between good and evil, Blackheart tried and failed to recruit Wolverine (Logan), the Punisher (Frank Castle) and the Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch) to his rebellion. Blackheart also aided Wonder Man against Mephisto and helped Misha of the mercenary Warheads as her telepathic “Voice”, using Mys-Tech’s Rathcoole to obtain a mystic sword which could harm Mephisto. Returning to Christ’s Crown, Blackheart altered his followers into the Corrupt, and employed Wolverine, Punisher, and Ghost Rider as a feint to allow him to anoint the sword with an innocent’s blood. He apparently slew Mephisto, banishing his “father” from Hell and restoring his own powers to full strength.\n\nAs Hell’s ruler, Blackheart focused on corrupting the Ghost Rider, aiding the Furies to possess mortal bodies to torment Ghost Rider (Noble Kale) and resurrecting the Scarecrow (Ebenezer Laughton) to send after Ketch. From his palace in the Burning Flesh district, Blackheart created his own Spirits of Vengeance: his consort Black Rose (the deceased Roxanne Simpson, ex-wife of Dan Ketch’s brother, Johnny Blaze), Verminus Rex (a spirit who had battled the Ghost Rider during World War I), Wallow (a homicidal mortal suicide whom Ghost Rider had thwarted), Doghead (a downtrodden immigrant), and Pao Fu (who had died in the arms of Ghost Rider as he tried to save her). Blackheart bargained to free Ghost Rider’s relatives from their curse; in return, Ghost Rider agreed to lead Blackheart’s Spirits. However, the pair fell out and Ghost Rider destroyed Blackheart, banishing him from Hell. While ruler of Hell, Blackheart had tormented the soul of the mutant Stryfe by manipulating the X-Force group, which attracted the attention of the mutant sorceress Selene. After banishment from Hell, Blackheart allied with Selene as the Hellfire Club's temporary Black King. After defeating Selene's enemy Alyssa Moy, Blackheart battled the Fantastic Four, Mechamage, Hellstorm, and Margali Szardos; they ultimately defeated Blackheart, binding him beneath New York's Hellfire Club. Trapped there, he continued to aid Selene, opposing X-Force in an attempt to corrupt Sunspot, while awaiting his inevitable release.",

As an adolescent, his mother traded him to nomadic scavengers who made him an apprentice mechanic due to his innate technological affinity. Soon after, Blaquesmith witnessed an act of sabotage by the Askani, a sisterhood of warriors led by Rachel Summers, the daughter of the X-Men’s Cyclops and Jean Grey from Earth-811, who were determined to overthrow the tyrannical rule of the eternal mutant Apocalypse. Blaquesmith helped them defeat Apocalypse’s Prelate Diamanda Nero, then assumed responsibility for training new recruits, such as Nathan Dayspring, a.k.a. Nathan Summers, the son of Cyclops and Jean Grey from Earth-616.After Dayspring became the soldier Cable and traveled to the modern era of Earth-616, Mother Askani bade Blaquesmith follow him. Soon after arriving, Blaquesmith was approached by Finality, leader of the Dark Sisterhood, whose aims he believed coincided with his own. He supplied the Sisterhood with psimitars, the Askani’s weapon of choice, and trained them in their use. Ultimately reunited with his former student, Blaquesmith began aiding Cable in his quest to prevent Apocalypse’s ascension. Blaquesmith soon asked Cable to destroy the perceived threat posed by Nate Grey, an alternate reality version of Cable from Earth-295; however, after a brief clash, Cable joined forces with Nate - much to Blaquesmith’s chagrin - to tackle the larger threat of Exodus. Blaquesmith later faced the psionic entity Onslaught, who destroyed his base. Believed killed, Blaquesmith was rescued by Cable from the time-traveling pharaoh Rama-Tut. He set up a new base in New York’s Hell’s Kitchen district and resumed his guidance of Cable. Blaquesmith soon encountered Apocalypse’s former servant Ozymandias and learned of the Twelve, a group of mutants who were destined to usher in a golden age for mutantkind, and of Cable’s role as their gatherer. Cyclops foiled Apocalypse’s attempt to usurp the Twelve’s power, merging with Apocalypse himself. In a misguided attempt to eliminate Apocalypse, Blaquesmith hired the mercenary Gauntlet to assassinate Cyclops, but Cable and Jean freed him and Cable supposedly fulfilled his destiny by slaying Apocalypse. Subsequently, when Cable was attacked by the Dark Sisterhood, Blaquesmith was again believed killed.He seemingly returned to help Cable spread the Askani religion around the world; however, this was revealed to be an imposter named Nigel Novotny who had become involved in a plot by the enigmatic Jackie Singapore to manipulate Cable. The true Blaquesmith eventually returned to join Cable’s Underground resistance movement in opposing the clandestine Weapon X project.",

      "biography": "Blastaar is a member of a race called the Balurrians, based in the Negative Zone. He ruled them for years as a brutal leader until they finally rose up and overthrew him, then sealed him up within a containment suit and set him adrift. It was only when the inhuman Triton braved the Negative Zone to save an adrift Mister Fantastic that the Explosive Belt around Earth revived Blastaar and he followed the pair through their portal and into the Baxter Building. There he met up with and joined the Sandman in order to take over Earth, but the Fantastic Four, with the help of Crystal, beat him and used one of Reed's inventions to shut off his powers, allowing them to return him to the Negative Zone. Since then, Blastaar has tried to return to Earth and conquer it, but has been repulsed many times by various super heroes; including the Fantastic Four and the Avengers. While adventuring in the Negative Zone, the Fantastic Four have since run into Blastaar again on many occasions. Blastaar has also regained the throne of Baluur for himself, and then begun a conquest of the Negative Zone, which has been primarily kept in check by the interference of Blastaar's hated enemy, Annihilus.Recently Blastaar has been seen in the positive universe in the company of the Spaceknights of Galador. Together they secretly fought Annihilus and his insectoid soldiers, which were known as the Annihilation Wave. Blastaar and the Spaceknights joined Nova and the United Front on the Kree planet of Canticus Prime, where they were able to defeat the forces of Annihilus.Blastaar later appeared on the Kree Homeworld of Hala, where he led a Kree battalion against the techno-organic invaders known as the Phalanx. Blastaar fought valiantly but was stomped into the planet by a giant size member of the Phalanx. His fate is unknown at this time.",

      "biography": "Mark Anthony Todd was born October 7, 1910 in Cleveland, Ohio. As he grew up he became a pacifist and went on to become a freelance reporter in the 30s. On his fist assignment Todd was sent to Japan were he found a race of super-intelligent Skull-Men. They accepted Todd and taught him occult secrets and gave him a burning mask. In return for their kindness and he vowed to the Skull-Men to be a beacon of hope and justice as the Blazing Skull. Todd then went to Germany where he joined an anti-nazi movement. He however was captured by Nazi agents and was brought before Adolf Hitler. He somehow managed to escape and traveled to London where he saved Winston Churchill's life from Nazi mercenaries.Todd then returned to the United States and resumed his reporter job with the Daily Globe. Still using the guise of Blazing Skull he continued to fight threats such as Big Joe and Doctor Fear. In 1942 he joined the Invaders to battle Battle-Axis. After the fight with Battle-Axis he joined the Invaders and other wartime heroes in a battle behind enemy lines. In January of 1945 the Skull returned to New York and foiled a plot by Nazi agents as they tried to blow up the Statue of Liberty. Their leader, the Masked Raider fled the scene, but vowed to return to make the Skull pay for his interference. Wanting more information on the story his editor at the Daily Globe sent him to London where he encountered the Iron Cross, who was filming a missile test. As the Skull and Iron Cross began to fight, Union Jack joined the Skull and the two managed to cause the Iron Cross to retreat to Germany. After the battle Union Jack helped the Skull by contacting the Destroyer in Germany. After that Jack flew the Skull behind enemy lines where Skull parachuted into Germany. The Destroyer greeted the Skull, and the two were found by Nazi soldiers. To deceive the Nazis, the Destroyer knocked the Skull unconscious and handed him over to the Nazis. Todd was then brought before Iron Cross and Nazi scientists who revealed their plan to use homing beacons in order to tactically bomb the United States. During this time the Destroyer was caught sabotaging the missiles. He was brought before the Iron Cross and managed to free the Skull who along with the Destroyer managed to stop the Nazis and blow up the Iron Cross. Todd returned to America and gave his story to his editors, who couldn't believe how lucky he was. However the threat wasn't over yet when the Masked Raider returned and tried to bomb the White House. Todd stopped the Masked Raider, who turned out to be a radio show host. However the missiles had been launched and the Skull commandeered a prop plane and rammed it into a missile, saving the White House.After the war had ended Todd became a newspaper columnist and urged the American people to support more military action overseas. Realizing that he had not aged in decades he returned to being the Blazing Skull. He used various aliases such as Steve Valiant and Richard Stetson. There are little or no records of his activities during the following decades. Eventually he was declared dead.During the Kree/Skrull War Rick Jones powers manifested themselves and he manifested various golden age superheroes. Among them was the Blazing Skull. The Skull managed to fight off several Skrulls and Kree soldiers until Ricks' powers failed and the heroes were sent back to wherever they originated from. Todd then recently showed up in the Middle East and taken into custody of a terrorist known as Malik for years. He was ritualistically beaten and tortured each day by urinating on him and beating him senseless. One day U.S.Agent aka John Walker freed Todd from his prison and asked him to join the new Invaders alongside Spitfire, Union Jack, and Tara. Todd accepted and aided the Invaders in an attack involving Atlantis. The team aided Namor and added him to their ranks. Together the Invaders invaded Mazikhandar and came into conflict with the Avengers. The Skull recognized Captain America and greeted him as a fellow Invader, forming a somewhat steady alliance between the New Invaders and the Avengers. After the skirmish a cruel politician shot the current leader of Mazikhandar and took control of the country. However the Thin Man showed up and killed the politician. Mazikhandar became a protectorate of Atlantis and the Invaders added Thin Man to their ranks. The Two teams parted ways and left each other on semi-good terms.Weeks later several cloned terrorist creatures called Pterorists attacked the Jim Hammond. Luckily the Invaders arrived and saved Jim. However the true motive of the Invaders saving Jim was to ask for the V-Battalions help. Jim accepted their help and along with the Thin Man's ship the Infiltrator, its captain the Fin battled Axis Mundi. During the battle against Axis Mundi aboard the Infiltrator the Nazi the Gotteskrieger impaled the Skull with a spear and ripped off his head. During the battle fellow Invaders fought Axis Mundi agents, Baroness Blood, Warrior Woman, and Meranno. During the battle the Skull managed to pick himself up and revive himself even without his head. The Skull was a major factor in the Invaders winning the battle when the Skull took down the Gotteskrieger.Days later the Destroyer and his friend Nigel encountered Vampires in Germany who were sent after a small town by Baroness Blood. The Invaders learned of this and sent Union Jack, Spitfire, Tara, and Jim Hammond who eventually defeated Baroness Blood. Weeks later Baron Strucker, the leader of Hydra sent a mind controlled Wolverine to attack the Invaders. During their first clash the Skull apparently recognized Wolverine and called him \"Charlie\", whether they truly have met before or it is just the Skulls mental instability is unknown. However during a clash between the Skull and Wolverine, Logan sliced off the Skulls left arm and leg. U.S.Agent then told the Skull to heal and managed to stop Wolverine before he could kill Namor. As the Skull flew the injured Invaders away Logan was sent on another mission by Hydra.Days later the Thin Man managed to capture Agent Axis and started to psychically torture them in order to get information from them. While the Thin Man tried to get information from Agent Axis, U.S.Agent and Blazing Skull watched Union Jack sketch a nude Tara. Enraged at their attitude Hammond and Spitfire chewed out Skull and Union Jack. However in order to \"help\" Jack with his sketches the Skull started to strip, showing his naked skeleton body. Grossed out Hammond and Walker forced Todd to redress himself. Captain America then tried to shut the Invaders down by infiltrating the Infiltrator. The Captain and the Thin Man fought for a few minutes before becoming aware of a plot by Meranno. The team along with Captain America intercepted Meranno and a fight broke out on a secluded island. There the team learned that Tara was an Axis Mundi sleeper agent. During the fight that followed Jim Hammond sacrificed his life in order to save Tara. However Tara became comatose and the Invaders continue to search for a way to save Tara from her comatose state.Recently, the Skull joined the 50 State Initiative and was contracted by Iron Man to work on the new Defenders team.",

      "biography": "Donnie Gill was working as a minor hired thug for Hammer Industries until businessman Justin Hammer gave him a battlesuit reminiscent of the original Blizzard (Gregor Shapanka). Gill mastered the use of the battlesuit, grateful and excited by his new powers, and began his first assignment: to recapture the supervillain known as Force, an agent of Hammer who had deserted him. Gill and his allies, the Beetle (now, MACH-IV) and Blacklash (now, Whiplash) engaged Force and his new ally, Iron Man. During the battle, Force saw Gill as misguided and misled by Hammer as he once was, and he tried to reach out to the young villain. In the end, however, Blizzard accidentally tripped himself up, electrocuting himself and allowing himself to be captured while his allies fled.  Before he could be remanded to prison, Gill was rescued by the Rhino on behalf of Hammer, which served to strengthen Gill’s loyalty to him and curtailed Tony Stark’s efforts to lend Gill legal and moral guidance. Gill continued to work with Hammer and his agents, but Hammer knew of Stark’s interest in helping Gill and used him as a bargaining chip to elicit Iron Man’s help in taking down their mutual enemy, the Ghost. Iron Man and agents of Hammer managed to stop the Ghost, but the villains turned on Iron Man, abandoning the Blizzard. Gill still held hope that Hammer would rescue him, until Iron Man played a recording of Hammer's bargaining. Crushed, Gill allowed himself to be placed in custody.Later returning to criminal activities, Gill appeared to hold no interest in reforming. He worked on behalf of the Spymaster once, trying to loot Stark Enterprises but was opposed by the Avengers, and he later turned to a solo career as a criminal. He attended the A.I.M. weapons expo on his own behalf, and later tried a replica of Shapanka’s final Blizzard suit. This suit proved defective, and he managed to use this in court as testimony against its repair man, the Tinkerer, who was being sued by the Trapster. Later still, he tried robbing an armored car and faced the New Warriors, but a rogue Iron Man suit of armor viscously beat him. With this series of failures, the Blizzard tried to be a part of a team again-- an mercenary group working on behalf of the Four Winds crime family.  The group was hired to invade Agent X’s headquarters, but they suffered a humiliating defeat. (Gill was even force-fed a candy apple.) Afterward, Gill joined the Crimson Cowl in one of the largest incarnation of the Masters of Evil, but their plans to hold the world ransom using a weather-controlling device were thwarted by the Thunderbolts.When the Avengers formally disbanded, MACH-4 decided to re-form the Thunderbolts, a team of former superhuman villains who were attempting to reinvent themselves as a team of heroic champions. Gill was recruited as a founding member of the new team and earned a parole.  The Thunderbolts made their debut by saving Manhattan from the terrorist attacks of renegade Atlanteans. Although Gill continually doubted his effectiveness as a hero, he began to grow more confident in the role despite the increasing deterioration of his battlesuit and overwhelming personalities in teammates like Speed Demon. In fact, when Gill discovered Speed Demon moonlighting as a criminal in his old Whizzer identity, he tried to force Speed Demon to stop only to be left hanging from a bridge in his underwear for his efforts. The new Thunderbolts experienced some shuffling membership after their big success in stopping the Purple Man from controlling New York. Songbird became the leader and dismissed the Blizzard from their ranks. Demoralized, he was nevertheless recruited by fellow ex-Thunderbolts MACH-4 and Baron Zemo, who recruited the Blizzard into a new team they were forming. With his costume redesigned and upgraded by the Fixer, the Blizzard joined Zemo’s team in confronting the Thunderbolts and their teammate Photon. During the battle, they forced Photon to realize his unstable personality and powers would result in the destruction of the universe, and Zemo killed him to safeguard reality. The two teams returned to Zemo’s headquarters, where he formed a new team of Thunderbolts under Songbird’s field leadership and his guidance.",

      "biography": "Believing himself a freak following the manifestation of his mutant nature, Fred Dukes used his newfound abilities as a carnival performer, earning him the nickname “the Blob.” Detecting Dukes’s mutant status, Charles Xavier sent his X-Men to invite Dukes to meet with him and he accepted, mostly due to an attraction to the beautiful young X-Man Jean Grey. While visiting the X-Men’s mansion home, Dukes was invited to join the team; but he arrogantly refused, believing himself superior to them. Xavier decided to wipe the knowledge of the X-Men from Dukes’ mind, but Dukes escaped back to the carnival, took it over, and led his fellow performers to attack the X-Men. They were defeated, and Xavier wiped their memories of the incident as well as the Blob’s knowledge of the X-Men. Later, Magneto offered Dukes membership in his Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. A blow to the head restored Dukes’s memories of the X-Men and he accepted Magneto’s offer, joining the Brotherhood in attacking the X-Men; however, during the battle, Magneto sent a barrage of torpedoes at the X-Men, not caring that Dukes was in the way. Uninjured but feeling betrayed, Dukes quit the Brotherhood and returned to the carnival. Dukes subsequently met fellow mutant Unus the Untouchable, and under subliminal commands from Xavier’s enemy Lucifer, the pair attempted to frame the X-Men as thieves. The duo became fast friends and went on to join Factor Three, an organization that sought world conquest; but the X-Men soon convinced the Blob and his teammates that their leader, the Mutant Master, was merely using them, and the two groups joined forces to unmask him as an extraterrestrial subversive before the defeated Mutant Master killed himself.Soon after, the Blob was among those mutants captured by Larry Trask’s giant robotic Sentinels, but was freed after the X-Men defeated them. Reforming the Brotherhood with Unus and Mastermind, they were contacted by the power-dampening mutant Krueger, who had captured some X-Men and was hoping to sell them to the Brotherhood. Dukes had Mastermind create illusory money to fool Krueger, and sought revenge on the X-Men by trapping them in an illusory circus; however, the ruse collapsed after Krueger arrived to confront the Brotherhood over their treachery, and the X-Men defeated the villains. Escaping custody, Blob’s Brotherhood next attempted to fool the Beast into believing he had killed Iron Man, thus manipulating him into joining them. After realizing the truth, the Beast single-handedly defeated them. \nDukes briefly reformed Factor Three, and used information stolen from Xavier’s computers in the hopes of recruiting more mutants. They kidnapped young mutant Sonny Baredo (the future Humus Sapien), though the Blob and others soon left him behind with the Ogre. Subsequently, Dukes, his mutant teammates and other mutants were captured by the subversive Secret Empire. Ultimately, they were freed by the combined efforts of the X-Men, Captain America, and the Falcon. Following Magneto’s return, Dukes rejoined the Brotherhood and aided Magneto in an attempted world takeover using Magneto’s creation, a being with unlimited power dubbed “Alpha the Ultimate Mutant,” but they were opposed by Xavier and the Defenders. Alpha ultimately turned on the Brotherhood, regressing them to infancy. Later restored to adulthood by Eric the Red of the alien Shi’ar, Dukes and the Brotherhood fought the Champions of Los Angeles but were defeated.Dukes then briefly joined a band of super-criminals posing as the Defenders during the heroes’ “Defender for a Day” recruitment drive, but they were defeated by a Defenders team led by Hercules. Later, Dukes was freed from prison by the shape-shifting mutant terrorist Mystique and joined her reorganized Brotherhood of Evil Mutants in an attempted assassination of Presidential candidate Senator Robert Kelly, which was thwarted by the X-Men. Mystique’s Brotherhood next attacked the Avengers, but again met with defeat. Dukes then joined Unus in battling the Hulk and subsequently witnessed Unus’ apparent death, which sent Dukes on a grief-stricken rampage that was quelled by Spider-Man and the Black Cat. After Mystique had the U.S. government pardon the Brotherhood for their crimes in exchange for becoming federal agents as Freedom Force, their first mission was to capture Magneto. Subsequent missions saw Freedom Force opposing the X-Men, X-Factor, the Avengers, the New Mutants, Daredevil, the Grip, the Reavers, the Hulk, and Firestar. During this time, Dukes also helped train replacement Captain America (John Walker), who subsequently accompanied Freedom Force in opposing the Resistants.After a disastrous Middle East clash with the Arabic super-team Desert Sword, Dukes and his teammate Pyro were captured by Iraqi military forces and served for a time as the personal bodyguards of the Iraqi commander until the Toad arranged for their release. Dukes and Pyro agreed to join the Toad's new Brotherhood. Following defeats at the hands of X-Force and X-Factor, Freedom Force’s replacement as the government’s sanctioned mutant team, the Brotherhood sought to capture the mutant Portal but were opposed by Darkhawk, Sleepwalker, and Spider-Man. Overlooked for recruitment into Magneto’s Acolytes, Dukes and the Brotherhood accompanied Pyro, who had contracted the deadly Legacy Virus, to the island home of Jonathan Chambers, a.k.a. Empyrean, a mutant who drained the energy expended by those dying of the Virus to ease their pain. Dukes and the Brotherhood were subsequently duped by Empyrean into stealing a time machine created by the X-Man Beast to allow Empyrean to travel back in time and release the Legacy Virus earlier; however, the X-Men intervened and Empyrean was instead sent back to the prehistoric age. Dukes was subsequently approached by the psionic being Onslaught, who augmented his powers in exchange for his servitude. Teaming up with the power-copying Mimic, Dukes battled the female members of X-Force but was defeated by Meltdown, who threatened to explode a plasma ball inside his body. After Onslaught was defeated, both Dukes and the Mimic offered their services to the “favor trader” Sledge, who in turn granted them better control of their abilities.After a clash with the mutant mercenary Maverick, Dukes formed a new Brotherhood consisting of himself, Mimic, Post, and Toad. On the run from the nanite-mutated computer Cerebro, Blob’s Brotherhood broke Xavier out of a government facility so he could train them to better oppose Cerebro. After helping the X-Men against Cerebro, Blob’s Brotherhood was recruited by Mystique to recover the head of X-51, the Machine Man. After that failed mission, Dukes attempted to hijack an armored car on his own but was defeated by Spider-Man. Mystique then assumed leadership of the Brotherhood, and sent them to attempt another assassination of Kelly, but they again failed due to the intervention of the X-Men and a dying Pyro, who sacrificed himself to save Kelly. He subsequently joined the army of mutants Magneto was amassing on the island nation of Genosha, but they were defeated by the X-Men. Later, Dukes and his former teammate Avalanche were among those mutants forcibly recruited into the paramilitary X-Corps group, led by former X-Man Banshee, until it disbanded following infiltration by Mystique. After he was overlooked for a new Brotherhood formed by Magneto’s former Acolyte Exodus, an aimless Dukes consulted psychologist Sean Garrison, who convinced him to be true to himself. Believing that “truth” lay in opposing the X-Men, Dukes went to the Xavier Institute only to find the X-Men absent. He attacked nonetheless, but was defeated by the students and taken into custody. When the world was restored to normal after the Scarlet Witch’s House of M|reality warp, Dukes was horrified to discover that he had been stripped of his mutant powers, resulting in tremendous folds of skin hanging loosely off his frame. Distraught, Dukes attempted suicide by cutting his throat with a knife; but due to his excess skin, he was unable to get the blade close enough.Someone that resembles the Blob was apprehended by the Thunderbolts and was seen in the Folding Castle Detention Quadrant.Blob later resurfaces as a member of the X-Cell, a group of depowered mutants who attack Mutant Town in defiance of the Decimation. After mistakenly getting into a fight with Rictor and Multiple Man and getting in a cheap shot on Rictor, he stole a car. With fellow X-Cell member, Fatale, he attempted to flee, eventually hitting an open manhole (left open earlier in the day by Strong Guy and Wolfsbane) and causing the car to crash leaving Blob hanging from the car. When both of them ran afoul of Marrow, Blob was thrown from the car.",

      "biography": "The twin red skinned cosmic  mercenaries known as the Blood Brothers are incredibly powerful and ruthless. Their powers increase when they are in close proximity of one another. The farther apart they are the weaker they become. They first became known as henchman for the Mad Titan Thanos. They were the guardians of his secrete base on Earth. They have taken on Earth heroes such as Iron Man, Daredevil and the Avengers while they were on Earth. They have also battled the cosmic heroes known as Starfox and Drax the Destroyer.The Blood Brothers were imprisoned in the Vault after their battle with the Avengers. Quasar for some unknown reason convinced the Warden to release them into his custody so that they could participate in a battle arena. He takes them to Mars where the Brothers pound unmercifully on Quasar, until Wonder Man contacts him to inform him that Makkari is on the move. Quasar uses the power of the quantum bands to form to giant hands, which he uses to help him, escape. The Blood Brothers are left stranded on Mars.They managed to escape their exile and one of the brothers appeared in a bar on Earth where he fought the U.S.Agent. The Agent easily defeated the one brother. After that it was learned that the Living Planet Ego was about to attack the Earth. The U.S.Agent enlisted the Blood Brothers and a bunch of other aliens to help him battle Ego and an enhanced race of Kree known as the Ruul. Together with the help of the heroes of Earth the Blood Brothers were able to help save the planet.This act of heroism in no way means that these two cosmic bad boys are in the hero business. They are later found on a prison transport vessel in route to the Kyln prison station located at the Universal Crunch. The other inmates on the ship are Drax the Destroyer, Lunatik and Paibok the Power Skrull. The transport crashed on Earth near a small town in Alaska. All the inmates survived the crash and were discovered by a ten year old girl by the name of Cammi. The Blood Brother became engaged in a battle with Drax the Destroyer. The battled ended with one of the Brothers losing his life. It is unclear if the surviving brother became weaker or stronger as a result of his brother’s death. It is safe to say that time will soon reveal this answer.",

      "biography": "Born in the mid-16th Century, the man who would become Bloodscream was a naval surgeon in Sir Francis Drake's fleet. Mortally wounded in battle, he was taken by Drake to a sorcerer named Dagoo to save his life but was instead transformed into a vampire-like creature. Doomed to a macabre existence, Bloodscream learned his condition could only be reversed with an elixir distilled from the blood of a man who does not age. Bloodscream set out to locate such a man and became a soldier, hoping to encounter fellow immortals on the battlefield.After centuries of combat, Bloodscream fought in the Battle of Normandy in 1944 during which he encountered a Canadian soldier named Logan. Decades later, Bloodscream joined the Asgardian brawler Roughouse as enforcers for the crimelord General Coy on the island nation of Madripoor. Under Coy's orders, the pair clashed with rival crimelord Tyger Tiger and her ally Logan, now the mutant adventurer Wolverine. Seeing that his foe had not aged since their last encounter, Bloodscream believed he could use Wolverine’s blood in his elixir. After numerous encounters with Wolverine, they had what was almost their final encounter in the snowy wilderness of Canada. After draining the blood from his cybernetic partner Cylla, Bloodscream faced Wolverine (who was virtually powerless after his last encounter with Magneto), but was unaware of the weapon which Wolverine had in his possession, the demonically-forged Honor Sword of the Clan Yashida. Wolverine ran him down on his motorcycle and apparently killed the centuries-old vampire with the sword.However, Bloodscream survived by draining nearby life energy and subsequently allied himself with the sorcerer Belasco. After clashing with the team of mutant adventurers known as the X-Men, whose number included Wolverine, Bloodscream was sucked into another dimension. Returning to Earth under unrevealed circumstances, Bloodscream was reunited with Roughouse. The pair were recruited as enforcers by the South American crimelord named the Black Tarantula who set them against both Wolverine and the costumed crimefighter Spider-Man.Later, Bloodscream came under the control of the cannibalistic sorcerer Mauvais. Alongside the savage criminal Vermin, he again fought Wolverine but met defeat once more. Mauvais was subsequently exiled into the dimension of the Great Beasts of Canada, presumably freeing Bloodscream from his control.",

      "biography": "Businessman Douglas Carmody headed a project to develop a matter/anti-matter converter. His chief scientist, Dr. James Power, was close to achieving this goal, drawing the attention of the Kymellian Whitey, whose race had destroyed their own world with a similar device, and the warlike Snarks, who sought it’s destructive potential. The Snarks kidnapped James and his wife Margaret, but their children (Alex, Jack, Julie and Katie) were saved and granted superhuman by Whitey. To prevent the converter destroying the world the Power children stole it, encountering Carmody, who recognized them, and concluded they were mutants. He called in government agents Link and Falcone to capture them; by the time they arrived the Power Pack (as the kids dubbed themselves) had rescued their parents. Seeing Carmody coming, the children fled; Carmody pursued and cornered them, then began shooting at them. James caught up, and overpowered him, after which Link confirmed the kids were not mutants. Disgraced, Carmody’s financial backers dropped him. Carmody, calling in a favor from a Project: Pegasus contact, obtained a surplus battlesuit, then, as the Bogey-Man, kidnapped Katie, though her siblings swiftly rescued her. Carmody tried again a few days later, battling Power Pack over Central Park. Having witnessed the fight and brought it to an end, the Asgardian Warriors Three warned Carmody another attack on the Powers would draw Thor’s wrath. Carmody continued to harbor a growing hatred of mutant children. Obtaining a more powerful battle-suit from the anti-mutant Right, Carmody kidnapped teleporter Rebecca Littlehale, coming into conflict with Power Pack and the New Mutants. They freed Rebecca, and the New Mutant Magik teleported Carmody into Limbo as punishment for his transgressions. There the demon N’Astirh devoured the luckless Carmody’s humanity, transforming him into a glutinous demon. Returning to Earth he terrorized the Powers, taking James and Margaret hostage. A running battle ended atop the Empire State Building, where James Power made Carmody confront his own reflection; horrified, Carmody threw himself from the rooftop. His physical form destroyed, the Bogeyman survived as a shadow; he took refuge within a ring, which fell into the hands of Chicago councilman Randolph Creed. The Bogeyman drove Creed to slay several homeless people before being confronted by Luke Cage, whom he swiftly took over. The possessed hero battled the Thing and Human Torch; realizing the Bogeyman was vulnerable to flame, Cage forced himself to walk a fireball, expelling the shadow within him, and apparently slaying the Bogeyman.",

      "biography": "Born in Australia, Fred Myers’ family moved to America when he was still very young. He developed a talent and passion for baseball, quickly becoming a top-notch pitcher and moving from a minor league position to one in the majors. Many sports writers agreed that Myers could have been one of the world’s greatest pitchers, but within a year, he was suspended for taking bribes. He found employment (and fulfillment) as an assassin for the subversive society known as the Secret Empire, who gave him the equipment and identity of Boomerang. One of his first known exploits on behalf of the Empire occurred when the Empire was investigating the U.S. Army’s Orion missile program, one that was being used against the Hulk. Boomerang kidnapped the General’s daughter, Betty Ross, in order to ask for the missile plans in ransom. Instead, he was defeated by the Hulk.   Upon the collapse of the Secret Empire, Myers returned to Australia briefly but eventually was hired by the criminal financier Justin Hammer who offered him new equipment and employment. Myers soon found work with other crime bosses, including the Kingpin and Hammerhead on separate occasions, or otherwise engaged in solo criminal activities. Never one to turn down a lucrative criminal opportunity, he has joined many groups over the years, such as the Sinister Syndicate, the Masters Of Evil, and the Sinister Twelve.",

      "biography": "Brynocki is a sophisticated robot created to serve as both assistant and entertainment by Mordillo (Simon Bretnor), a former MI-6 agent turned crazed assassin. Brynocki was one of a multitude of robots on the East China Sea’s Mordillo Island. Having lost a million-dollar contract on drug-lord Carlton Velcro after Velcro died battling Shang-Chi, Mordillo sought revenge on Chi and his MI-6 allies, stealing their Solar Chute – a device able to focus sunlight into a deadly weapon. Mordillo kidnapped MI-6’s Leiko Wu (his former lover) to force from her further control over the Chute, and Chi and MI-6’s Clive Reston traveled to Mordillo Island to rescue Wu and stop Mordillo. At Mordillo’s command, Brynocki launched the sub-orbital Chute, despite lacking fine control over it and despite Mordillo and Chi being aboard it. Defeated by Shang-Chi, Mordillo jumped into the path of the Solar Chute's energy and was instantly burnt to a skeleton. Brynocki recovered the skeleton and vowed to continue serving Mordillo, no matter what.Still serving Mordillo, Brynocki and cybernetic martial artist Shockwave were hired by MI-6 to eliminate former agents Black Jack Tarr, Shang-Chi and Leiko Wu (mistakenly believing them to be agents of Fu Manchu). Chi and Wu tracked a kidnapped Tarr to Mordillo Island and fought Mordillo’s robots. Deciding in mid-battle that Shockwave was crazy and not worth keeping as an ally, Brynocki turned against him. Shockwave teamed with Chi, Wu and the freed Tarr to destroy the robots and escape the island, leaving Brynocki to apologize to Mordillo's lifeless skeleton. Later manipulating Mordo’s skeletal limbs like a puppet and pretending to serve his orders, Brynocki sent the powerful robot Ultra-Men to slay Wu, so her skeleton could be placed by Mordillo as his queen. Chi and his allies destroyed the Ultra-Men, while Brynocki fell from a plane after Chi side-stepped his charge. Decapitated in the fall, Brynocki simply directed his body to pick up his head and began planning anew.Soon after, the Spaceknights ROM and Starshine (Brandy Clark) unwittingly landed on Mordillo Island during their global travels. Brynocki felt they were trespassing on Mordillo's property, so he sent legions of robots after them. He brought along Mordillo's skeleton as his co-pilot in one of Mordillo's Dragon-Fly ships, attacking the two Spaceknights personally. Starshine shot them down, and Brynocki left the skeleton behind in the jungle so he could face the intruders without its added weight. Brynocki attempted to convince Rom and Starshine that he had been wronged in the past by Shang-Chi, but Rom saw through his ruse. The two Spaceknights left Mordillo Island, and the distraught Brynocki was unable to find Mordillo's skeleton, which had sunk in quicksand.Via robots and a voice projector, Brynocki later used the illusion of a resurrected Mordillo to form the Golden Dawn cult, youths seeking to overcome death. Shang-Chi and Moon Knight tracked the missing youths and exposed Brynocki, who self-destructed, destroying Mordillo’s skeleton in the process. A restored Brynocki was reprogrammed to serve the assassin Arcade, who re-christened Mordillo Island “Murderland”, but Brynocki was reprogrammed again by Tony Stark and helped defeat Arcade.",

      "image": "https://terrigen-cdn-dev.marvel.com/content/prod/1x/bug.jpg",
      "biography": "Bug is an Insectivorid master thief and adventurer from the planet Kaliklak in the Microverse (a.k.a. Inner Space), a \"sub-atomic\" realm actually accessed via the energies of shrinking. Known as a humorous, lighthearted flirt, he is also a charismatic leader and adept warrior. Bug was raised on Kaliklak during the tyranny of the near-immortal evil Baron, and he trained under a master thief. He eventually rose to lead a gang of rebels, running raids against Baron Karza's forces. Betrayed by his father, Wartstaff, he was captured by the colonial governor. Bug escaped in a fighter craft, encountering a Raider spacecraft in which the stoic armored Acroyear, crown-prince of the planet Spartak, was bound by his traitorous brother, Shaitan. Bug rescued Acroyear, and Shaitan fled. Though opposites in temperament, Bug and the king formed an unbreakable bond of friendship. They were eventually captured, sent to the empire's central planetary system, Homeworld, and forced to fight in Baron Karza's Pleasure Pits. During one battle, Commander Arcturus Rann returned from a millennium-long telepathic journey across the Microverse which he had spent in suspended animation aboard his ship, the H.M.S. Endeavor, with his roboid companion, Biotron. Greeted with hostility from Baron Karza's Dog Soldiers, Rann was imprisoned with Bug and Acroyear. They escaped the Pit and fled along with Princess \"Marionette\" Mari and her roboid, Microtron, forming a team that later became known as the Microns. Breaching the Spacewall surrounding the Microverse, the group landed on Earth (Earth-616) in Daytona Florida at roughly one-twelfth their normal relative size. They befriended teenager Steven Coffin and his father, Ray. Separated from the team, Bug followed the Coffins to the laboratory of Prof. Philip Prometheus at Cape Canaveral's Human Engineering Life Laboratories (H.E.L.L.). There Bug defended Steven from the mad professor, who wished to use his Prometheus Pit, a passageway between Earth and the Microverse, to learn the science of Inner Space and transcend the limitations of his cybernetic body. Reunited, Bug and the team encountered the Man-Thing, while Baron Karza used the Pit to enter Earth. The Baron aspired to conquer Earth, but was repelled by the power of Captain Universe, wielded by Ray Coffin. Back home in the Microverse via the Pit, Bug traveled to Spartak. When Baron Karza's fleet attacked, Bug made a daring move causing an explosion launched Bug into hyperspace, where he crash landed on his home planet. Feared dead, Bug survived and discovered his old gang had been corrupted by his father, Wartstaff. Reunited with his lover, Jasmine, they ejected Wartstaff and launched a surprise attack against the colonial governor at the Central Nest. Bug was victorious, but his father was shot down. Unbeknownst to Bug, Rann had become one with the Enigma Force (the power behind the Microverse) and defeated Baron Karza. Bug and Jasmine returned to Homeworld for the victory celebration.Bug and the team left for new adventures, teaming with the Fantastic Four against the emotional assault of Psycho-Man. During the battle, a reptilian alien killed Jasmine, devastating Bug. They fled to Earth again, where Bug was captured by a man called Odd John, who mutated Bug into a savage creature and planned an insect invasion of Earth. Bug was restored thanks to Ant-Man (Scott Lang). Alongside his team, Bug later faced the evil computer Computrex, Mentallo, the Fixer, and the Toymaster (revealed to be Prof. Prometheus). Back on Homeworld, Mari's brother, Prince Argon (Force Commander) betrayed his love, Slug, under Baron Karza's mentally implanted orders. Utilizing Argon's body, Baron Karza was reborn. With Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D., Bug and his team defended Earth from Baron Karza and Hydra's forces. Bug rescued an artifical Spartakian warrior named Dagon, who betrayed them, destroying Rann's roboid. Extracting the knowledge of the Enigma Force from Rann, Baron Karza eradicated the manifestations of the Enigma Force. Kaliklak's queen, Esmera, sacrificed herself using her stinger upon Baron Karza while Acroyear utilized Spartak's Worldmind again. The Baron was defeated, but Rann was left in mind-shock, while Spartak was in ruins. Bug learned that in order to save Rann, revive the Enigma Force and repair the Spacewall, they needed to retrieve three keys of the Microverse. Aided by the roboid Nanotron and the Prince of Sandzone, Bug and the team located two keys in Homeworld's lands of Oceania and Polaria, while Acroyear discovered the third on Tropica (adding Devil and Fireflyte to the team in the process). In Aegypta, Argon again became a tyrant like Baron Karza and captured Bug and his team, seeking the keys to augment his power. The team escaped and used the keys to restore the Enigma Force to Rann, who, with Dr. Strange, then unified the Spacewall before the Microverse collided with the Earth and the Macroverse. Bug and the Micronauts traveled again to Earth, pursued by Argon's mercenaries. The evil Dr. Nemesis shrank Bug, Marionette and Acroyear back to the Microverse, where they aided the rebellion against Argon. The Baron physically emerged from the husk of Argon, where he had been incubating. Rann returned to Homeworld, but was powerless to defeat Baron Karza; the team fled in Rann's new ship, the Bioship, now joined by Huntarr, a living weapon. The Baron began a wave of genocide against all his enemies. While Rann meditated with Fireflyte to convince the manifestations of the Enigma Force to aid them, Bug journeyed to Prisonworld seeking allies. Frustrated by Rann's seclusion while seeking transcendence, his lover Mari began a brief affair with Bug. The team ventured to Kaliklak for help, where the planet was under attack by battle-beetles. With Jasmine's sister, Treefern, Bug ushered in the hatching of a new queen, Lyca. Though indebted, Kaliklak could offer no aid, a war against the beetles being their first priority. Bug and his team joined forces with the X-Men to aid Baron Karza against the Entity, an evil psychic manifestation of Professor X threatening the Microverse; Baron Karza eventually lost his arsenals and his armies to the Entity. On Homeworld, Baron Karza executed all save those he transformed into monstrous Unmen in the Body Banks. When he faced the Enigma Force, Baron Karza chose mortality over power and immortality, since the latter would strip him of his desire for conquest. Thus, he was unable to withstand the combined might of the heroic team's final assault upon him.With Baron Karza slain and Homeworld in ruins, the team set out upon new voyages of peace into the Microverse. On the Endeavor II, with reconstructed versions of their roboids, Bug, Rann, Acroyear, Huntarr and Mari sought rest on the planet Fiame. A warpdrive malfunction sent them far beyond the known portion of the Microverse, where they discovered a Child of the Makers, a huge alien lifeform which mutated Huntarr further. Using an egg from the Child to power the ship, they encountered a friendly intelligent race called the Children of the Dreaming Star. Mari reunited with Rann, leaving Bug despondent until he met the alien shapeshifter Solitaire, who assumed a pleasing form as an Insectivorid Marionette. The two fell in love but, feeling out of place, they left for Kaliklak. However, after imagining a series of assaults on his allies, Bug flew back to them. The team discovered they were dying of radiation poisoning released by the Child of the Makers, but the alien egg hatched a creature that mutated Huntarr so he could rebuild his friends' bodies. When Devil, Homeworld's sole survivor, became distorted while trying to transport across the Microverse, the team decided to return to Homeworld. They learned Baron Karza's slaughter of Homeworld tore a wound into the planet's sentient Worldmind, causing it to go mad, spreading its pain across the Microverse and corrupting the Enigma Force. While Rann retired for a contemplative life, the egg's hatchling evolved into a being called Scion who aided the team's return to Homeworld. Bug and the other Micronauts ultimately sacrificed themselves, their bodies and spirits re-seeding Homeworld with life and ending the pain of the maddened Worldmind, though he was saddened that Solitaire had refused to join him. However, this was not the end of Bug. A reborn Baron joined the mad titan Thanos in a plot to destroy all \"subatomic\" realms. Restored in the process, Bug, Rann, and Mari teamed with Earth's X-Men against the villains, and in the ensuing struggle all \"sub-atomic\" realms were merged into a single reality. Soon after, Bug, Rann, and Mari helped Earth's Cable, Domino, and Garrison Kane rescue Copycat from Psycho-Man. Joined by Dexam, a cybernetic victim of the Body Banks, Bug opposed Baron Zebek - a new tyrant from Aegyptus patterning himself after Baron Karza - in Tropica's city Antica. Baron Zebek was defeated with the aid of Alpha Flight, having arrived from Earth via the Prometheus Pit. Following the Negative Zone's Annihilus in jaunts through Earth space and time, Bug witnessed many key moments in the early years of the Heroic Age. Calling themselves the Microns, Bug, Rann, and Mari also helped Captain Marvel (Genis-Vell) search for Drax in the Microverse. They discovered Dexam had betrayed them to Visalia of K'ai, and later fought Psycho-Man and Captain Marvel's evil twin, the alternate future clone Fredd. Note: Bug’s speech is interspersed with a \"tik\" sound due to an Insectivorid’s chitinous membrane in the throat. Bug has an aversion to water.",

Known as the Bug-Eyed Voice, Bigelow concealed his true identity and unnerved his victims by wearing a bizarre bug-eyed mask that distorted his voice. The weird thief became a local media sensation and reveled in his notoriety, but after a narrow escape during a robbery, Bigelow decided to rob an antique fair and use the proceeds to retire; however, local superhero Speedball (Robert Baldwin) thwarted the scheme and the Voice was arrested. Bigelow and several other Springdale-based Speedball foes subsequently worked as henchmen for mad scientist Rebound (Clyde) after he busted them out of prison, but the criminals were captured through the combined efforts of an alternate Speedball (Darrion Grobe) and Niels the Bouncing Cat. Later, Bigelow moved to Wisconsin and kept a low profile until Speedball (Baldwin) came to Madison, Wisconsin to promote his New Warriors reality television series. Wearing a modified mask and wielding paint guns, the Bug-Eyed Voice tried to disrupt the event, but Speedball’s admirer Squirrel Girl beat Bigelow senseless.

      "biography": "A mercenary of mystery, nothing is really known about the man called Bullseye. Once, he was captured and interrogated in a highly secured U.S. prison, and he related many details about his early life, such as the time his brother set fire to their home in an attempt to kill their father. However, much of this information is suspect, as Bullseye then escaped, taunting his interrogators that much of what he said was false-- especially the fact that it was not his brother who set fire to the house, it was himself. Bullseye proceeded to set fire to the prison, where his father was also held, and he left his father to die once more. (In a previous account of his childhood, he painted a bullseye on the forehead of his abusive father when he was passed out from drinking and shot him.)\n\nBefore his mercenary career, it’s been suggested that Bullseye tried his formidable throwing skills to become a Major League baseball player, but he was too selfish and sadistic for that. According to Bullseye himself, he grew bored and annoyed pitching a no-hitter, so, for the last pitch of the game, he threw the ball at the batter, killing him. Instead, Bullseye found his true calling as a special operative of the United States National Security Agency and, from there, a freelance assassin-- a perfect career for someone who got so much pleasure from killing his enemies. He created his signature modus operandi of using thrown weapons during one of his first outings as a soldier-- a guerilla fighter got the drop on him, and Bullseye’s weapon failed to shoot. He threw the gun instead, killing his assailant with his bayonet.\n\nHis early endeavors included time in Africa and Nicaragua, coming into conflict with the Punisher, and working alongside fellow mercenary Deadpool.\n\nBullseye first came to notoriety with a series of extortion attempts and murder in New York City, publicizing his antics by agreeing to an interview with The Daily Bugle. Bullseye fought and defeated Daredevil’s attempt to stop him, although the hero soon tracked him down and prevented Bullseye's extortion schemes.\n\nBullseye was then hired to murder the lawyer Matt Murdock, Daredevil's secret identity, but was defeated by Daredevil. In his own mind, Bullseye believed his formidable reputation was ruined, and he swore vengeance, fighting Daredevil at any opportunity in a personal vendetta that led him to hold a TV studio hostage, to kidnap the Black Widow, or simply by tracking him down. Each time, he was captured and given over to the police by Daredevil. At one point, Bullseye was declared insane due to a brain tumor, and he began hallucinating, seeing random people were actually Daredevil, and tried killing them all. The true Daredevil managed to defeat him, and the tumor was removed.\n\nLater, when following an assignment to kill the Kingpin, Bullseye simply received a better offer from the Kingpin and agreed to work with him, instead. However, after returning from yet another imprisonment by Daredevil, Bullseye was furious that the Kingpin had chosen Elektra as his assassin in the meantime. Bullseye killed her with nothing more than a playing card and her own sai weapon. Earning the enmity of Daredevil, Elektra's lover, Bullseye fought the enraged hero high over the tops of New York City, and Bullseye was allowed to fall to his death by Daredevil. He did not die, however, his spine shattered, paralyzing him. With the help of a Japanese crime lord, Lord Dark Wind, Bullseye's bones were laced with Adamantium in the hopes that Bullseye would freely serve Lord Dark Wind as his head assassin. Instead, Bullseye, now recovered, returned to New York to pursue his mercenary career. Before he could continue in the Kingpin’s employ, he had to first prove himself by fighting his former mercenary friend, Deadpool. The fight was close, but Bullseye was triumphant.\n\nAt one point, Daredevil left New York for a prolonged period, and Bullseye put on the Daredevil costume himself. He gleefully played the part of a hero while robbing the rich and giving to the poor. However, never a man quite sane, Bullseye began to believe himself to be the true Daredevil, and Matt Murdock adopted the Bullseye’s costume to confront him. Murdock won, and the defeat allowed Bullseye to return to his senses (relatively speaking, of course.)\n\nBullseye performed several jobs for the Kingpin while also pursuing several other mercenary contacts. One such contract brought him into conflict with the Punisher on behalf of Rosalie Carbone. Hired by Mysterio to kidnap a baby from Saint Maggie’s Church, Bullseye killed Karen Page, further earning the vengeance of Daredevil. When the news of Daredevil’s secret identity leaked to the media, Bullseye hoped to capitalize on the information and kill Daredevil both for his own satisfaction and to help the Kingpin’s struggling criminal empire. He targeted Murdock and his new girlfriend, Millie Donovan, but Daredevil snapped, beating Bullseye to a pulp and carving a bullseye pattern onto his forehead with a rock. Bullseye has a compulsive need to study his targets' histories, abilities, and relationships before engaging them. As a result, he can anticipate his opponent's every move. This compulsion however, often crosses from the professional into the personal, such as Bullseye's obsession with Elektra.\n\nBullseye was chosen to act as a sleeper agent for the Thunderbolts when Norman Osborn was given control of the team, and then moved on to become a member of the Avengers under the guise of Hawkeye. After Osborn invaded Asgard and was defeated by the Asgardians and a number of Earth's heroes led by Steve Rogers and Nick Fury, Bullseye's Hawkeye days were over. He once again switched back to his criminal persona and went back to his old ways - and old sparring partners. He resumed his feud with Daredevil and was killed when the \"Man Without Fear\" impaled Bullseye on his own weapon.",

He had to get the first two because of a viral infection that was half-technology, half-organic, but he's a bit sensitive about it taking over his body. He'd much rather discuss his time as a member of the X-Force or New Mutants. He is a hero between two worlds, two time periods, and two dimensions, who has spent his life as a hardened warrior, yet longs for peace at last.",

      "biography": "If you’re a mutant and you’re with a 25-mile radius of Caliban, he will sense you. However, you might not see him much because he spends most of his life underground, living with the Morlocks—failed experiments by the Dark Beast who established their own outcast society in the tunnels beneath New York City.\n\nA Solitary Start\n\nThe albino mutant known as Caliban was recruited by Callisto, who used Caliban’s mutant-tracking ability to assemble the underground mutant community later known as the Morlocks. Callisto became leader of the Morlocks and named by Caliban after the grotesque being in William Shakespeare’s play “The Tempest.”\n\nLiving in the sewers and abandoned subway tunnels beneath Manhattan’s streets with the Morlocks, the naïve Caliban found a renewed sense of family with the Morlocks, but still felt lonely among his fellow outcasts. One evening, Caliban sensed the presence of mutants in a New York City nightclub and entered to find the Dazzler (Alison Blaire) performing. Caliban’s presence created a panic, which X-Men members Storm and Kitty Pryde attempted to quell alongside Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew). During the chaos, Caliban kidnapped Pryde and fled. Intercepted by the heroes, Caliban explained that he only wanted a friend who was like himself. After being invited to join the X-Men, Caliban chose to return to the Morlocks.",

      "biography": "When Callisto was young and beautiful, her life seemed so perfect, so enviable. But catastrophe struck, blinding her in the right eye and leaving her horribly disfigured. Forced to hold up a mirror to her new reality, Callisto realized that society had little use for a beautiful women who was beautiful no more.Scared and alone, she rebelled against society and decided to go underground where it was safe, and where she could escape prying, peering eyes. She quickly made a huge abandoned military tunnel called \"the Alley\" built underneath Manhattan in the 1950s her home.With help from the mutant-detecting Caliban, the devoted Sunder and the treacherous Masque, she organized a community of mutant outcasts called the Morlocks. (Unknown to Callisto, the Morlocks were being manipulated by the extradimensional sadist called the Dark Beast, a twisted alternate version of Hank McCoy.)In recent years, Callisto, apparently driven to irrationality by her responsibilities, abducted the winged Angel (Warren Worthington III) as a consort. Angel's X-Men teammates invaded the Alley but were captured as well. The team's leader, Storm, challenged Callisto to trial by combat, almost killing her and winning the mantle of Morlock leader. Initially hating Storm, Callisto, de facto leader in Storm's absence, grew to respect the X-Men and their founder, Professor X, whose life she saved after a beating by anti-mutant protestors.\n\nCallisto and her growing band of outcasts became the victims of a massacre, orchestrated by Mister Sinister and implemented by his team of Marauders. The few survivors, including Callisto, were treated by Moira MacTaggert on Muir Island, Scotland; in gratitude, Callisto appointed herself MacTaggert's bodyguard and assisted Cyclops against the mutant-hating Master Mold. However, she was captured by Masque, who had, via the young telepath Brain Cell, enslaved the remaining Morlocks. To taunt her, Masque restored Callisto's long-lost beauty, altered her memories, then freed her in New York to be hunted down. However, the X-Man Colossus protected Callisto, and Masque returned Callisto's scarred appearance before escaping.When Masque was believed dead, the remaining Morlocks went mad and attacked Callisto, who sought the X-Men's aid. However, Mikhail Rasputin, Colossus's brother, convinced Callisto to join him in leading the Morlocks to the Hill, a dimension of rapid time passage. There the survivors built a new society, but the younger generation escaped to Earth as the terrorist unit Gene Nation. Callisto again recruited the X-Men to stop her wayward charges, whom she later tried to rehabilitate in the Alley.When the government anti-mutant persecution increased, Callisto and her protégé Marrow attacked official Henry Gyrich but were held off by Spider-Man, who in turn helped battle Prime Sentinels. Severely wounded, Callisto was cared for by Marrow, but the Dark Beast manipulated her into departing. She resurfaced as a mutant gladiator in the mysterious Arena, her body given tentacles by a surviving Masque. However, when Storm was pressed into Arena performance, Callisto joined Storm and her allies to topple Masque. At Storm's request, Callisto joined Professor X's efforts to rebuild the decimated nation Genosha; as a member of his informal inner circle, the Genoshan Excalibur, she has fought Trolls, the Weaponeers and other threats.In the aftermath of the House of M, Callisto lost her mutant powers, and her tentacled arms reverted to normal.",

      "biography": "The eldest of ten children, young Sam Guthrie was 11 years old when he became involved in a plot by the Deviants, a genetic offshoot of humanity, to improve their evolutionary status by performing experiments on children. Sam was saved by the timely arrival of the mysterious Deviant Sledge, and the minds of the children - including Sam - were wiped of the events that had transpired. Five years later, Sam's father died, and as the oldest sibling he felt responsible for supporting the family. Giving up a college scholarship, he followed in his father's footsteps as a coal miner. When Sam was trapped with a co-worker in a collapsing mine, the stress of attempting to escape triggered his latent mutant power, enabling him to blast them both free. Renegade Hellfire Club member Donald Pierce learned of Sam's powers and manipulated him into serving as one of his operatives. Pierce sent Sam into battle against Professor Xavier and his fledgling New Mutants team; however, Sam refused to kill the young heroes, instead teaming up with them to defeat Pierce. Xavier subsequently realized that Sam had been misled and invited him to join the New Mutants as Cannonball. Sam soon found himself in the role of co-leader, a position he found awkward due to his relative slowness in mastering his mutant powers compared with his teammates. He also formed a lasting friendship with his teammate Sunspot.\n\nLater, Sam saved the life of intergalactic rock star Lila Cheney, an act that saw a romance blossom between them. During this time, Cannonball also teamed up with Spider-Man against the threat of the Incandescent Man. After the cosmic entity known as the Beyonder slew and subsequently resurrected most of the New Mutants, Sam lost what knowledge he had gained about his mutant abilities, forcing him to start learning about them over again. The encounter also left the New Mutants somewhat apathetic, and then-headmaster Magneto sought help from the Hellfire Club's presiding White Queen, Emma Frost, who enrolled them in her Massachusetts Academy and recruited them into the ranks of her Hellions. Magneto learned that he had been tricked and sought to reclaim his students, bringing him into conflict with the Avengers. After the New Mutants sided with Magneto, Frost recanted and helped restore them to their former selves. Sam's relationship with Lila eventually progressed to the stage where he asked her to visit his home and meet his family. When Lila arrived with a crystal gift for his mother, Sam mistakenly believed she had stolen it when she had actually carved it by hand. Lila left angrily, but after Sam saved her life following a plane crash, he apologized. Later, Sam and the New Mutants came to Lila's aid after she had been kidnapped by the alien Spyder. Rescuing her, Lila seemingly sacrificed her life to stop Spyder's other captives from wreaking havoc in the universe. Sam was heartbroken at Lila's apparent death. However, when she later resurfaced alive, they both realized that their romance was over as the two had moved on with their separate lives.\n\nWhen the time-traveling mutant soldier Cable took over the stewardship of the New Mutants and reorganized them into the strike team X-Force, Sam learned that he was an apparently immortal mutant, one whom Cable had traveled back in time to find and guide. During a clash with the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, Sam's blast field was disrupted by Phantazia and he was seemingly killed by Sauron; however, this manifested his apparent immortality and he returned to life. Sam eventually became romantically involved with his teammate Tabitha, a.k.a. Boomer. When X-Force were separated from Cable for a time, Sam took the reigns of leadership. He eventually graduated to the ranks of the X-Men, which placed a strain on his relationship with Tabitha. Later, the ancient mutant Selene cast doubt on Sam's supposed immortal status, posing questions that have yet to be answered. The X-Men sent Sam to spy on Graydon Creed, a presidential candidate running on an anti-mutant platform. Under cover as Samson Guthry, Sam joined Creed's campaign staff and was able to gain his trust, though Creed was soon assassinated. Returning to the X-Men, Sam soon found himself in battle against the super-strong and virtually invulnerable Gladiator of the intergalactic Shi'ar Empire's Imperial Guard who had come to Earth seeking to forcibly enlist the X-Men's help. With creative use of his powers, Sam was able to withstand Gladiator's most powerful blow and defeat him. Eventually, Sam left the X-Men and returned home to care for his sick mother. He soon encountered Deviants once more, though he had no recollection of their past meeting, and sought help from X-Force in opposing them, rejoining the team afterwards. Sam became X-Force's leader again shortly before they were called upon to aid former spy Pete Wisdom in recovering a downed satellite from Genosha, and his memories of his childhood encounter with Deviants were restored afterwards. Later, Sam asked Wisdom to help give the team a new purpose, and to that end Wisdom introduced the team to the shadowy world of black ops. After Wisdom faked his own death, Sam once again assumed leadership and continued Wisdom's crusade until X-Force seemingly died in a cataclysmic explosion. They later resurfaced, but by then a new media-savvy team had assumed the mantle of X-Force and trademarked the name. Sam went on to join Xavier's X-Corporation, a global search and rescue unit for oppressed mutants, but after a disastrous mission that resulted in the death of his teammate Darkstar, he desperately sought a fresh start. After reigniting his romance with Lila, Sam met with the weather-manipulating mutant Storm and seeing her X-Men team's role as global mutant peacekeepers as the chance he was looking for, accepted an offer to join. After Storm's team became the international, government-approved X-Treme Sanctions Executive, they moved back into Xavier's mansion. Soon after, Sam was injured in a battle against the extradimensional Fury and temporarily left the team to recuperate.\n\nBack at the family farm, Sam was approached by Cable to rejoin X-Force to help oppose the threat of the ancient evil known as the Skornn. He declined, claiming that Cable was not to be trusted, and battled his former teacher. Defeated, Sam was then recruited into the Mutant Liberation Front by its new leader, a future incarnation of Cable's long-time ally Domino posing as the despotic Stryfe. The MLF teamed with X-Force, the feral X-Man Wolverine, and members of the Fantastic Four to oppose the Skornn, who was defeated at the apparent cost of Cable's life. Sam then joined his former X-Force teammate Siryn and the merc-with-a-mouth Deadpool in locating Cable, finding his essence scattered across various alternate Earths. They collected it and returned to their own Earth where the mutant techosmith Forge was able to restore Cable.\n\nAfter M-Day, Sam returned to the mansion, shocked to find that his sister Melody had been depowered. Recently, Sam joined Rogue's strike team after Serafina, one of the hyper-evolved Children of the Vault, entered his mind and made him believe that they were married and had a family. Sam was severely upset by this psychic violation, though soon resolved his feelings after defeating Serafina.",

He was born presumably between World War II and the late 60's, and enjoyed living with his other brothers and sisters. William was on hand when the villainous brother, Vincent, was slain by their father for circumstances yet to be revealed. This and other events led to the family adopting the \"Relative Strangers Protocol\", where the various members split up across the globe to assume alternate identities. William ended up in Australia, where he adopted the name William Chance and soon assumed an acting career. Chance's latest series of films where the \"Cap'n Oz\" action movies, and he enjoyed unparelled success (not to mention an intimate relationship with his co-star, actress Alice Springs, who portrayed Cap'n Oz's sidekick, Taz.)More recently, certain crime-fighting exploits of his most recent siblings (known as Crimson Crusader and Imp), caused the existence of the Clan to be known. Several agents of the mutated scientist Lenz tried to kill William looking for their stolen device. Willaim was soon contacted by his sister, \"Cuckoo,\" who explained the situation, but William hestiated to re-establish his association with the Clan.Note: The following has been revealed to be a part of a nightmarish dream of Rory, the Crimson Crusader, and may not be actual reality: After the battle with Lenz, the family reorganized on the Destine estate, with Willaim joining them soon after. He helped the Crusader and Imp as a chaperone for various escapades, but he always used a different identity and a different costume (the Nightmangler, for example.) William, at this time, revealed that Cuckoo was not a member of the Destine family and presumably fought Vincent when he was resurrected.",

      "biography": "CAPTAIN AMERICAFrom the dark days of world war to the explosive challenges of today, Super-Soldier Captain America stands ready as a shining sentinel of liberty to shield the oppressed and fight for freedom everywhere.Ninety-Eight-Pound WeaklingA poor orphan from the wrong side of the tracks in the days leading up to World War II, goodhearted Steve Rogers enlisted in the army to fight the Axis Powers, but met with rejection due to his small size and underdeveloped physique. Professor Abraham Erskine, a pioneer in the development of a Super-Soldier for the United States, saw potential in Rogers and whisked him into Project Rebirth, the professor’s bold experiment in enhancing the human body to its peak powers.Rogers found himself subjected to Erskine’s treatments— a specialized serum and exposure to a unique form of radiation—and realized the professor’s dream, becoming the world’s first, fully developed Super-Soldier. Now muscular and tall, as well as possessed of amazing strength and agility, the former ninety-eight-pound weakling watched in horror as a Nazi spy shot and killed Erskine, and thereby ensured Rogers would be the last of his kind.&nbsp;The United States government moved swiftly to fashion Rogers into a living symbol of inspiration to the public at home and soldiers abroad. And, after extensive combat training he debuted in a colorful, patriotic uniform as Captain America. Operating out of the army’s Camp Lehigh in Virginia, Rogers posed as an ordinary soldier, but conducted secret missions stateside and abroad as his alter-ego to smash spies, saboteurs, and the occasional Super Villain who threatened the country he loved so dearly. Soon, Cap captured the attention of the Red Skull, his evil counterpart in Germany, and the two formed a lasting enmity over the course of the war. The hero also gained a near-indestructible shield with which he became supremely efficient in both offense and defense.",

      "biography": "Steve Rogers grew up in Brooklyn, a scrawny kid protected from neighborhood bullies by his best friend “Bucky” Barnes. Enlisting around the time the United States entered World War II, Steve could not be approved by his Staff Sergeant because of his below average fitness. Sergeant (Dugan) had other ideas and enlisted Steve in a top secret project. Steve voluntarily underwent six months of steroids, surgery, and other experimental treatments supervised by (Dr. Erskine), becoming the world’s first genetically-enhanced perfect super-soldier. After a successful final test, the guards turned out to be Nazi spies and shot Dr. Erskine in the back, killing him. Steve was then evacuated by loyal soldiers. The authorities seemed unable to replicate the process thereafter. Clad in stars-and-strips military fatigues, he became “Captain America“, his image used to bolster Allied recruiting.Over the next three years Captain America undertook numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside Canadian “Lucky” Jim Howlett, who would later become the X-Men Wolverine. In Poland in 1944, he battled Kleiser, one of the Nazi’s secret extraterrestrial Chitauri masters, blowing up a train delivering parts for a super weapon. A year later, he led an assault on an Icelandic base where the Nazis were launching a prototype nuclear bomb at the White House. As the rocket launched, he climbed aboard and wrecked its guidance system, causing it to explode seconds later. Though believed dead, Steve was thrown clear into the icy Arctic Ocean. Rather than dying, he seemingly fell into suspended animation and was found decades later by a team of marine biologists.Steve awoke in a S.H.I.E.L.D facility, where General and director of S.H.I.E.L.D (Nick Fury) with a handful of scientists greeted him and soon appointed leader of Ultimates, America’s new superhuman strike force. Struggling to adjust to 21st century life, he helped subdue the rampaging Hulk and attempted to recruit Hawk-Owl, coming to blows with the Chicago vigilante. After teammate Giant Man abused and nearly killed his wife, the Wasp, Steve tracked him down and hospitalized him. When the Chitauri resurfaced, Steve led a successful counterattack during which he duped the Hulk into slaying Kleiser. Soon after this mission, he and the Wasp became a couple.\nCaptain America has led the Ultimates against the Brotherhood of Mutants, the X-Men, and Norman Osborn‘s group of failed attempts to reproduce the super-soldier process, known as the “Six”. On a Tunguska expedition he learned of a Soviet super-soldier project and fought a man who claimed to be his Russian counterpart. When his former teammate Thor seemingly betrayed the Ultimates, Steve angrily confronted Thor, and later led the team in capturing him. Recently, Captain America was instrumental in the Ultimates forcibly stripping a Middle Eastern country of its nuclear arsenal.",

      "biography": "Brian Braddock’s life was planned for him from before he was even born; for him there is no coincidence. Merlyn sent James Braddock to Earth-616 to sire a champion who could defend the multiverse against the myriad threats facing it; the studious Brian was his third child. He grew up a solitary child, save for his siblings, losing himself in books. Home on a break from studying physics at Thames University, Brian was out dating Valerie Campbell when his parents were killed, apparently in a lab accident but actually by the computer Mastermind; Brian was overwhelmed with guilt that he had not being present to prevent their deaths. He took a summer job at Darkmoor Nuclear Complex, a secret research facility near the Scottish border, soon after his parents died, trying to keep himself busy, but the facility was attacked by the forces of Joshua Stragg, the Reaver, who sought to kidnap the scientists within and make it look like they had all died in a reactor accident. At the urging of his mentor Dr. Travis, Brian fled on a motor bike to get help. Forced over a cliff by his pursuers, he dragged his injured body from the burning wreckage to witness a vision of Merlyn and the Lady of the Northern Skies (Roma) above a ring of standing stones; told to choose between the Sword of Might and Amulet of Right, Brian picked the latter, feeling the sword was a symbol of death and that he was no warrior. He was struck by mystical energy and transformed into the costumed hero Captain Britain; the new hero swiftly gained the upper hand against the Reaver, who, after grabbing the sword, had been transformed by the Nethergods, Merlin’s foes. Brian publicly debuted fighting the crimelord Vixen’s minions in London, though some, such as Chief Inspector Dai Thomas of Scotland Yard, were not glad to see him; he also battled Hurricane (Albert Potter; another villain empowered by the Nethergods), and faced Doctor Synne near Braddock Manor. Brian learned Synne was Mastermind’s pawn, and the truth about his parents’ deaths; he confronted the machine, apparently switching it off, though in fact the computer simply faked its demise. Brian teamed with Captain America, Nick Fury, and Lance Hunter, Director of S.T.R.I.K.E. (Special Tactical Reserve for International Key Emergencies), Britain’s equivalent to S.H.I.E.L.D., to battle the Red Skull; early on in this skirmish Mastermind used holograms to fake Braddock Manor’s destruction in a bomb strike. While battling Lord Hawk, a former colleague of his father who used a robotic hawk built for him by Brian in his campaign against modern society, Brian was badly injured. While his body lay dying in a S.T.R.I.K.E. medical facility, Merlyn and Roma brought his spirit to them, and after testing him again, replaced his quarterstaff with the Star Sceptre. Brian returned to his healed body and slipped out of the S.T.R.I.K.E. base. Following this he battled foes such as the mercenary biker Highwayman, deposed tyrant the Manipulator (Basil Crushstone), aliens beneath Scotland’s Loch Ness and their mechanical monster, the hellspawned Black Baron, Doctor Claw and his mutations, and the assassin Slaymaster.Brian visited America on a student exchange program, rooming with Peter Parker (Spider-Man), alongside whom he faced the assassin Arcade and the lycanthropic Litter; towards the end of this stay homesickness and stress saw him temporarily drinking more than was wise. After a brief trip home, Brian returned to the States to complete his studies, and there joined other heroes congratulating the newly pardoned Hulk, as well as fighting against the shapeshifting Dire Wraiths. Eventually Brian left America, but mid-flight realized the plane was under attack by the Nethergods, seeking to kill him; hoping to spare his fellow passengers, temporarily driven mad by psychic assault, and with King Arthur’s spirit trying to protect and direct him, Brian leapt from the craft. He had a vision of washing ashore on an island with a trio of standing stones (where Arthur’s body was held captive by Netherworld forces), then he came to, amnesiac, on the shores of the U.K. For months Brian lived as hermit in Cornwall, until Merlyn sent the Black Knight to find him. With his memories partially restored Brian and the Knight, allied with Vortigen the Proud Walker, battled Modred the Evil. Both Knight and Britain were snatched out of time to join the Grandmaster’s contest of champions, where Captain Britain fought against the Arabian Knight, but they were soon returned to resume their quest. At the entrance to Otherworld Brian was slain by the spectral White Rider, and his corpse claimed by Mandrac, Nethergod Lord of the Slain and the Rider’s master, though Merlyn and the Knight swiftly recovered it. Merlyn reunited Captain Britain’s departed spirit with his body, resurrecting him. While the hero healed, Merlyn restored his remaining memories, and informed him of the Nethergod’s involvement with his early foes. Now recalling Arthur’s location, the Knight, Britain, and the elf Jackdaw, were sent to awaken the King. Succeeding in this quest, Arthur then sent Brian and Jackdaw magically away through the dimensions, stating Brian had a destiny to fulfill elsewhere.As the pair slipped between realities, Merlyn took the opportunity to upgrade his champion, transforming his costume to enhance his strength and incorporate the powers of flight and forcefield previously part of his sceptre. The pair arrived on Earth-238, immediately encountering Mad Jim Jaspers and his Crazy Gang. Soon coming to realize he was not on his native Earth, learning that this world once had a Captain U.K. Brian found himself fighting the Junkheap that Walked Like a Man, and encountered the highly evolved Algernon the Rat. Tracking the source of these latter two artificially evolved beings, Brian met Saturnyne and her Avant Guard, representatives of the Dimensional Development Court. Initially the Avant Guard devolved Brian into a apelike primate, but after being restored (and further enhanced) by the same substance which had been used to evolve Algernon, Brian made his peace with Saturnyne's crew, helping them battle the Status Crew, this England's anti-superhuman police. He aided Saturnyne in her mission to evolve this reality up to minimum standards, but after they believed they had succeeded, Jaspers unleashed his mental powers, plunging the world into an insane maelstrom. The authorities reactivated their hero killing cybiote, the Fury, which slew Jackdaw; Saturnyne fled, abandoning Captain Britain, whose arm the Fury broke without even trying. Brian gained a brief reprieve when Jaspers picked him up in a flying teacup and explained how he had engineered the destruction of every other superhuman on this planet, before dropping the shell-shocked hero in a superhero graveyard, where he found Captain U.K.’s empty grave. There the Fury caught up with him, and incinerated him on the spot.Merlyn and Roma retrieved his remains - a rag, bone and hank of hair - and rebuilt him, moving his powers from his costume to his body and enhancing his senses, before returning him to his own world, Earth-616. Needing to touch base with something familiar after so long away, Brian returned to the site of the bombed Braddock Manor, discovering it was intact, and learning of Mastermind's ruse. Soon after Brian had switched off and repaired the computer, he was contacted by Betsy. He learned she had been recruited by S.T.R.I.K.E. Psi Division, but that Vixen was now secretly in charge of the organization and had sent Slaymaster to kill the telepaths before they could expose her takeover. Brian fought and defeated Slaymaster in central London, and the surviving psis moved into Braddock Manor. Brian next fought alongside his old ally, Captain America, against the insane wizard Modred the Mystic (not to be confused with his Otherworld foe, Modred the Evil); then he was kidnapped by the Special Executive, a team of interdimensional mercenaries, who had been hired by Saturnyne to bring him to an alternate Earth as a defense witness at her trial, where she was accused of causing the chaos wave engulfing Earth-238 – there Brian met two more of his interdimensional counterparts, Captain England and Captain Albion. Brian was outraged when prosecutor Lord Mandragon destroyed Earth-238 to prevent the infection spreading (and destroy the evidence which could clear Saturnyne). To prevent Saturnyne’s execution, he and the Executive battled their way out the court and fled to Earth-616, and the residents of Braddock Manor increased once more. Moments after entering the Manor, Captain U.K., sole surviving hero of 238, turned up on the doorstep, to inform them that the Jaspers of 616 was about to launch his own campaign of hero genocide. At first Brian refused to believe things would repeat the course of 238, but then the Fury, which had survived the destruction of its dimension and tracked down Brian to 616, attacked. It slew some of the Executive before being temporarily immobilized in a cave in; the Executive left for other realities, while Brian and his remaining allies fled into London. Jaspers took control of the country with incredible speed, his powers hastening things along, and used Vixen’s S.T.R.I.K.E. to round up the country’s superhuman population into concentration camps. Horrified at the fascist state his country had become, Brian went to confront the architect of the madness; as he reached Downing Street, Jaspers unleashed his Warp, twisting reality into an Escheresque nightmare. Brian’s experiences over the years, carefully orchestrated by Merlyn to strengthen his mind and body, allowed him to stay sane under Jaspers’ bombardment, but he was no match for his opponent powerwise, though he struggled valiantly on for as long as he could. Then the Fury arrived, beating him to a pulp, and would have killed him again, except that Jaspers caught its attention; it had been unable to attack its creator, something which had always irritated it, but this counterpart was not the same man. The Fury slew Jaspers after a prolonged battle; the battered Captain Britain tried to destroy the weakened cybiote, but it was only the intervention of Captain U.K. that finally did the deed. The two heroes and Saturnyne, who was also present, were then whisked off to Otherworld by Roma, to attend Merlyn’s funeral, as he had apparently been killed while observing the conflict, and there Brian met many of his fellow Corps members for the first time. He and Captain U.K. then returned to Earth-616.\nSix months passed after the abatement of the Jaspers’ Warp, and the country returned to relative normality. Brian encountered the vulpine mutant Meggan, fighting her until Micky Scott, a bystander and friend of Meggan, died in the crossfire. Guilt ridden, Captain Britain threw himself into doing good deeds, then after Micky’s funeral, approached the Scott family to apologize for Micky’s death. They forgave him, recognizing it was an accident, and he was reunited with Meggan too, learning she was not a monster, and was equally grief stricken over Micky. Brian offered to let Meggan stay at the Manor, and help her find her family, whom she had been separated from during Jaspers' purges, but then they were attacked by armoured opponents who appeared out of the air; the subsequent battle destroyed the Scott’s flat. Another attack occurred at Braddock Manor a few days later, but the newly returned Betsy repelled it with her strengthened psi powers. Later, in the space of a few hours Brian faced the 616 version of the Crazy Gang; Slaymaster and the Vixen; Sidney Crumb, a tramp who had been infected by the Fury and turned into a monster; and Gatecrasher’s Technet, an interdimensional mercenary outfit similar to the Executive. They had been hired to retrieve Kaptain Briton, Brian’s counterpart from Earth-794, who had fled to 616 to escape his insane lover, the tyrant Sat-Yr-9. Brian fought Briton in Braddock Manor, but lost, and was mistakenly taken to 794; repulsed by the psychotic leader and her regime, he convinced the Technet to take him home. He returned to find Briton slain by Betsy. That night he learned from Mastermind that his father was from Otherworld, and R.C.X. came to Braddock Manor to ask for refuge in housing the Warpies, children transformed by the Jaspers’ Warp; after a fight with the Cherubim team of Warpies, during which Meggan learned of her transformative powers and took on an appearance designed to attract Brian, R.C.X. moved in at the insistence of Betsy. For a couple of days Brian put up with sharing his home with government covert ops and hundreds of mutated children, drinking to cope, before learning that his brother Jamie had been taken captive in Africa. With Meggan he traveled to Mbangawi to free him, only to learn that Jamie had become a slaver and murderer, and deserved his punishment. Unwilling to return home, Brian and Meggan traveled the world for several weeks, visiting Bali, the Himalayas and Egypt, and romance blossomed between them, before ending up in Russia where they fought the witch woman Baba Yaga. They were then snatched through time to help Gatecrasher in fourteenth century Peru, then returned home to Braddock Manor, where Brian witnessed Betsy in a Captain Britain costume; angered that R.C.X. had convinced his sister to replace him, Brian decided to quit. He used Incan gold to buy a lighthouse, and he and Meggan moved in; they spent nearly half a year there, during which time Brian didn’t wear his costume, learning as his powers grew that it had been a largely unnecessary crutch. His retirement ended when Betsy was attacked and blinded by Slaymaster; Brian felt her pain, flew to her aid and killed Slaymaster. Realising he could not deny his responsibility, he took up the mantle of Captain Britain once more. A few months later he settled his long-standing differences with Dai Thomas, when the policeman turned to him for aid in capturing a superhuman killer murdering Glaswegian mobsters. Through undisclosed circumstances he and Captain U.K. later briefly traveled to the interdimensional port of Maruthea, and got involved in a bar room brawl. Some time later Brian learned Betsy had been kidnapped from Switzerland by Mojo, and turned into the spineless one’s latest act, when he witnessed her as “Psylocke” on “Wildways”, a television show. Though it took months, Brian tracked Betsy down to New York to rescue her, but was telepathically subdued, then transformed into a teenage boy. Doug Ramsey helped him regain his own mind and fight back, even with his powers depleted by his transformation, buying Doug time to break Betsy’s conditioning; Brian was returned to normal as soon as their foes were vanquished. A few months later Brian returned to New York with Meggan to check up on how Betsy was doing living with the X-Men, and fought Horde alongside them. Not long afterwards Brian heard that Betsy had been killed in Dallas, unaware that Roma had in fact been manipulating events to make this appear to be the case, as part of a long term plan to force Captain Britain and Meggan to join a carefully selected team of heroes which included some of the surviving X-Men. Distraught, Brian drowned his sorrows, verbally abusing Meggan when she tried to console him, before drinking himself into a stupor. He was awoken by Nightcrawler throwing him into the sea; the mutant then informed him that Meggan had come to Muir Island for help, only to be kidnapped by the Technet along with Shadowcat of the X-Men. Sobering up, Brian aided Nightcrawler and the others in overcoming both the Technet and extradimensional Warwolves, who had been hunting Phoenix (Rachel Summers) for Mojo, and afterwards, the five heroes formed Excalibur to carry on the X-Men’s dream. Knowing he was powerful enough to normally function without a team, and to ensure he would stay with one, Roma secretly inflicted Brian with a “blunder jinx”, which hampered his efficiency when acting solo.The new team worked closely with Dai Thomas, helping track down the escaped Warwolves, and Brian renewed his friendship with old flame Courtney Ross, confiding in her his doubts about being in a team and in his relationship with Meggan. His new teammates moved into the Lighthouse, and soon confronted him on his drinking habits – though initially annoyed, he recognised that he was beginning to develop a tendency to turn to the bottle when stressed, and decided to give up alcohol before it became a problem. Arcade then kidnapped Courtney Ross, and lured Excalibur into trap, where they were confronted by the Crazy Gang. Tweedledope used a device to switch their bodies and minds round – Brian ended up in Tweedledope’s body briefly. After escaping Brian was briefly seduced by Courtney (actually her counterpart and murderer, Sat-Yr-9, who used his doubts and her own powers of influence to do so). The team followed Phoenix to New York to find it in the grip of a demonic \"inferno,\" and Brian was transformed by a possessed Meggan. His costume was destroyed by Shadowcat using her Soul Sword, freeing him of this control; however Brian later found during rest of stay that his powers were fluctuating. Returned to U.K., he fought Hauptmann Englande, another counterpart of his (this time from a Nazi reality), and his Lightning Squad; Brian’s powers returned in full mid-fight now that he was home. He briefly adopted a costume outwardly identical to his damaged one, but lacking Merlin’s micro-circuitry. Arcade attacked Excalibur again during this period, sending the robotic Loonies to overpower Excalibur; he trapped Brian in a virtual world where he was confronted by temptations to drink, but this fell flat as Arcade had failed to realize alcohol was not the demon he thought it was for Brian. Later Excalibur worked alongside the X-Babies to defeat Mojo’s Agent, battled the Demon Druid, and Brian was briefly impersonated by the mutant Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde). Meanwhile interdimensional negotiations saw a prisoner exchange arranged, with Lightning Squad and their cohorts being returned to their own reality, but treachery on the Nazi side saw the entire Excalibur team thrown through the timelines. Their first stop was Earth-1193, a world of magic, where Brian picked up the costume of Captain Marshall; then on through a panoply of worlds, where Brian encountered a villainous Jamie secretly controlled by Brian’s own brother back on 616; his Corps counterpart Crusader X on a world where Britain still ruled the Americas; and the Lord High Justicer, his analogue on a polluted world where he was the law. Their trip came to an end on Otherworld, where Saturnyne (now based there at Roma’s command) sought to arrest Phoenix; Excalibur fought several members of the Corps to prevent this.Finally returned to Earth-616 the team immediately faced Galactus; Brian was then reunited with his old ally Black Knight to fight Morgan Le Fay’s agent Dreadknight, then the extradimensional ninja known as the Nth Man, and confidence tricksters Cooter and Bash. Alongside Power Pack he fought Nightmare, then he battled a possessed Meggan, and was hypnotised by Mesmero to battle Fenris. Excalibur and Brian barely had a moment to rest, as further battles ensured; they fought the Shi’ar Imperial Guard alongside the Starjammers, and with Thor battled the Wrecking Crew and pursued Juggernaut into another dimension. Brian was temporarily merged with his Nazi counterpart Hauptmann Englande, fought against the She-Hulk and alongside Plasmer, with the Black Knight and Captain Kerosene against the Sleepers, alongside Silver Sable’s Outlaws, took on Arnim Zola, in Limbo battled Doctor Doom alongside the Avengers' western branch, and once more took on the Warwolves.Meggan was again possessed, this time apparently by the Changeling's ghost. In trying to exorcise her, Brian and Excalibur seemingly discovered Merlin alive and well and encountered Jackdaw’s ghost – though much of this was later proven to be a deception. Excalibur later aided W.H.O. against a reanimated Air-Walker android. The Technet targeted them, but were easily overpowered; abandoning Gatecrasher and Yap, the remaining mercenaries moved in with Excalibur. A stressful and overcrowded week wore down Brian’s temper, and his growing jealousy of Nightcrawler’s obvious interest in Meggan led to a confrontation, where Brian broke Kurt’s leg. He was snatched from 616 by the Corps for this crime, and put on trial on Otherworld for this and other transgressions against their code, with Captain U.K. as his defense council and Hauptmann Englande as his prosecutor. Refusing to recognize the Corps’ authority, he was sentenced to death, and battle ensued, swiftly ended by Roma’s decree that Brian was to be released without charge. Before she departed, Captain U.K. explained to Brian that the Corps members’ abilities were powered by the matrix between dimensions. Brian confronted Roma, who admitted to him her manipulations and removed her blunder jinx. Returned to Earth, Brian made peace with Nightcrawler, and with new allies adding their might to Excalibur, they faced Necrom, the foe the team had been created to fight; the original team members physically merged to undo the damage Necrom had done to the multiverse, then Phoenix defeated him.\nLater the temporal assassin Sidestep pitted Brian against Cyclops during the American Revolutionary War, then back in his own time, Brian fought Arcade alongside Spider-Man, and took on the Crazy Gang in a bizarre Wonderland. Betsy returned home for a visit, but at a reunion of Excalibur’s friends, Sat-Yr-9 revealed that she had infiltrated their circle in the guise of the murdered Courtney, when her agents and Jamie Braddock attacked and took them captive; Sat-Yr-9 attempted to brainwash Brian to serve her, but when she ordered him to kill Meggan, he resisted. Sat-Yr-9 fled, but Brian vowed to track her down and avenge Courtney. Next, Excalibur worked alongside the X-Men against the Asgardian Troll Associates, then Brian visited Wakanda, where he fought Icon in the guise of “Jungle Man” and “Captain Wakanda”. Taking a break, Brian proposed to Meggan, only for them to be captured by the Cherubim on behalf of  R.C.X., who tried to forcibly recruit Excalibur’s members; when Brian subsequently refused to comply, he was beaten to a pulp, and would have died had Roma not intervened and healed him. Phoenix, who had been absent since shortly after the Necrom battle, rejoined the team after they dealt with R.C.X., and after they briefly assisted the extra-dimensional Khaos against Ghath, the team traveled to the future to overthrow the Sentinels who ruled Rachel’s timeline. However on the return trip Brian was lost in the timestream; Meggan acted as his anchor while Brian spent an indefinable amount of time being buffeted from future to past. He was drawn to Phoenix, a temporal anomaly, and eventually with the aid of Daytripper (Amanda Sefton), swapped places with her, returning to the present; however his experiences had changed him, and he took the new identity of Britanic.Initially cold and distant, unable to distinguish memories of the past from memories of the future, Brian’s love for Meggan remained constant; as time passed his old personality gradually returned. The team faced the likes of Stryfe’s lethal legacy, the Phalanx, and Brian and Betsy entered the comatose mind of Jamie to try and see if they could reach the loving brother they once knew. Excalibur faced the evil sorcerer Gravemoss, visited Genosha where they began to get the first inklings of the villainy of rogue covert ops group Black Air, then fought X-Man (Nate Grey) at Muir Island, their new base. One last prophetic dream warned Brian of a dystopian future forming, shortly before Shinobi Shaw prompted him to infiltrate the Inner Circle of the London Branch of the Hellfire Club, claiming his father’s title of Black Bishop, and learning of the Club's alliance with Black Air and plans to take over the U.K. To face them, Brian resumed his identity as Captain Britain, and battled the body thief Mountjoy, helping to end the threat and thwart the terrible future he had foreseen.Subsequently, Excalibur battled the Mutant Liberation Front when they attacked Muir Island. Brian renewed his proposal to Meggan, seconds before he was kidnapped by the Dragons of the Crimson Dawn, who planned to use his energies to open a rift between the Earth and their realm; instead, with the aid of Meggan, he absorbed the power of the rift, closing it, but at the cost of his own powers. No longer Captain Britain, Brian took a sabbatical from Excalibur to figure out what he wanted to do with his life now. He returned a few months later, confidant in one thing; that he loved Meggan. Soon after they were married on Otherworld by Roma. Brian returned to scientific research, working out of Darkmoor, until the arrival of Captain U.K., pursued by armored warriors. Together with Meggan, Psylocke and the Black Knight, Brian accompanied Captain U.K. to Otherworld, where they rescued Roma from Mastermind and an army of Warpies. During this adventure Brian encountered a hologram of his father which alleged his parents had deliberately had Mastermind kill them, and then renewed Brian’s powers. He took up the Sword of Might, returned the Warpies to human form, and ascended the throne of Otherworld. Some time later, he collected his sister’s body after she was slain by Vargas. Learning of Morgan le Fay’s latest plot against England, to reverse his mystical connection to the Matrix by attacking him in Otherworld with god-killer weapons, so that injury to him would cause destruction in Britain, he passed his mantle on to a new 616 Captain Britain, Kelsey Leigh, before Morgan could take him captive; without his connection, Morgan could not use him against his home, and Kelsey proved her worth by defeating Morgan.A recent reality storm saw Brian and Meggan return to Earth-616, to try and avert disaster before Roma was forced to destroy the entire reality; there Brian was briefly transformed into the King of Britain in an altered timeline. Meggan apparently sacrificed herself to seal the rift between dimensions, preventing the damage from spreading, and after the original timeline was restored, Brian remained on 616 on the instructions of Roma and formed a new incarnation of Excalibur.",

      "biography": "Captain Marvel has always been a torn between worlds, whether due to the bigotry of his alien homeworld, to his entrapment in the Negative Zone, or to his current realization of the call of duty over the knowledge of his fate. Throughout it all, however, he has proven over and over again why many consider him to be one of the greatest heroes of all time.\n\n \n\nVisitor from Another Planet\n\nMar-Vell was a white-skinned minority of the blue-skinned Kree empire, but despite discrimination and prejudice, Mar-Vell became a renowned soldier and an acclaimed hero for his victories in battle against the Kree's enemies, notably the Skrulls.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMar-Vell’s regiment, under the command of Yon-Rogg, was given a mission to observe Earth, specifically human’s progress of space travel. Yon-Rogg, jealous of the love between Mar-Vell and the ship’s medic, Una, ordered Mar-Vell to infiltrate Cape Canaveral, Florida, alone. He then secretly tried to fire on Mar-Vell’s ship, but killed a human instead-- Dr. Walter Lawson. Mar-Vell took advantage of resembling Lawson to pose as the doctor and create a secret identity, but Yon-Rogg again secretly tried to kill Mar-Vell by activating the Kree robot, the Sentry. In his Kree uniform, Mar-Vell publicly defeated the robot, and the onlookers acclaimed him as \"Captain Marvel,\" misinterpreting what the Sentry called him.\n\nMar-Vell continued to observe humanity, in both his secret and costumed identity, growing increasingly sympathetic for Earth and its inhabitants. His initial adventures were typically extensions of Yon-Rogg’s attempts to kill, discredit, or otherwise destroy him, such as the time Yon-Rogg manipulated Ronan the Accuser to fight Mar-Vell by framing Captain Marvel as a traitor. Mar-Vell also had to navigate the romantic triangle between him and Una and the aggressive attention of his co-worker at the air base, Carol Danvers. These situations came to a head when Una overheard one of Yon-Rogg’s plans to kill Mar-Vell, and she was captured by his agents when she tried to warn him. Although Mar-Vell’s execution failed with the arrival of the Aakon aliens, she was shot in the battle and died in Mar-Vell’s arms as he tried to rescue her.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMetamorphosis\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBefore Mar-Vell returned to confront Yon-Rogg, he encountered a powerful being named Zo that granted him increased abilities. Around the same time, he ran afoul of Commander Zarek, who hoped to set up Mar-Vell as a traitor. It was he and Ronan that created the illusion of Zo, with which they again manipulated Captain Marvel into thinking he must destroy his home planet Kree-Lar. Marvel was made temporarily a fugitive until Zarek and Ronan were uncovered by the Kree’s Supreme Intelligence. The Supreme Intelligence then revealed to Captain Marvel that it knew of Zarek and Ronan’s treachery the entire time and orchestrated events so that Mar-Vell would be involved in their plot as the Intelligence hoped to use Mar-Vell for even greater things. Claiming Captain Marvel had “passed” these tests, he clothed Mar-Vell in a new costume and allowed him to retain some of his new-found abilities.\n\nHowever, as soon as Captain Marvel left to return to Earth, he instead found himself in the extradimensional realm known as the Negative Zone. The Supreme Intelligence then mentally lured the Earth youth Rick Jones to an abandoned Kree base on Earth in order to bid him to wear the \"Nega-Bands.\" By slamming the bands together, Jones and Captain Marvel shared a telepathic link as well as, more importantly, switch places between Earth’s universe and the Negative Zone. In no time at all, Captain Marvel was called out by Yon-Rogg, who was holding Carol Danvers as a hostage. In a last-ditch effort to destroy his rival, Yon-Rogg battled the hero, but Captain Marvel rescued Carol and Yon-Rogg was killed in an explosion as they escaped. (The exposure to Yon-Rogg’s weapon, the Psyche-Magnetron, transformed Carol into Ms. Marvel.)\n\nCaptain Marvel and Rick Jones continued shared adventures for many months. At one point, Mar-Vell happened upon the idea to use Mister Fantastic’s doorway into the Negative Zone to release Rick and allowing the two to share an existence in the Earth dimension simultaneously. Shortly afterward, both Rick and Marvel were swept up in the intergalactic Kree-Skrull War alongside the Avengers, where Rick encountered the Supreme Intelligence. The Intelligence released the latent psionic potential in Jones’ mind in order to help stop the war, striking all soldiers motionless and teleporting Jones’ allies to the Kree homeworld, among other fantastic feats. Rick was left very near death, and Captain Marvel sacrificed part of his lifeforce to save Jones, “merging atoms” with him so that they could become linked as in their previous relationship.\n\nAfter many more months and many more adventures, Rick Jones’ body could no longer contain both his own lifeforce and that of Mar-Vell, and he collapsed. His girlfriend Lou Ann Savannah took him to her uncle, who used special photonic energy to revive him, and Jones and Captain Marvel could continue to switch places. In fact, Captain Marvel now found he could absorb solar energy and redirect it to fire energy bolts or to exhibit superhuman strength.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nProtector of the Universe\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen Captain Marvel became involved against the plans of the alien nihilist Thanos, he was contacted by Eon, a guardian entity of the universe who commissioned Captain Marvel as the next \"Protector of the Universe.\" He also granted him a special “cosmic awareness.” With a newfound title and purpose, he became the primary force against defeating Thanos. In fact, it was his new cosmic awareness that allowed Captain Marvel and the Avengers to defeat the mad Titan, since it gave him insight into Thanos’ use of the Cosmic Cube. Thanos became convinced that he had drained the Cube of its power and discarded it, allowing Captain Marvel to grab the Cube and restore reality to a time before Thanos had gained control over the universe.\n\nAs time passed, Mar-Vell and Jones overcame the dimension-split between them, existing side-by-side once more, although often they would need to merge in order to maximize Captain Marvel’s power. They adventured in this manner for a long while. When Commander Zarek returned, he led the Lunatic Legion, which included transforming a lowly engineer into the villain Nitro. Nitro was sent to steal canisters of nerve gas when Captain Marvel confronted him. Although Nitro was defeated and Captain Marvel seemed to have re-sealed the canisters before endangering the public, he himself was exposed to the gas, which would later prove disastrous.\n\nIn a direct conflict with Captain Marvel, Zarek and the Lunatic Legion would have nearly succeeded in bringing him down if it were not for Marvel’s increased powers when merged with Rick Jones. Captain Marvel returned to the Kree homeworld to inform the Supreme Intelligence of the plot, but, surprisingly, the Intelligence revealed its true motives-- that it had known of Zarek’s plan and, in fact, had secretly been a driving force behind nearly all of Captain Marvel’s history. The Supreme Intelligence had long known the Kree had reached an evolutionary dead-end, and its only hope as a species was to integrate other genetically compatible races with its own so as to revitalize the Kree's stagnant development. He had specifically chosen Mar-Vell due to his genetic make-up and had also chosen Rick Jones specifically because of the latent psychic potential he housed. It further arranged to have them both \"bond\" by means of the Kree Nega-Bands, a process that was repeated or replicated throughout their history, because the Intelligence knew he couldn’t add Jones' brain to its collective organism directly until it was tempered by contact with a Kree brain such as Mar-Vell's. Using the unique Kree-bred flower called the Millennium Bloom, the Supreme Intelligence then proceeded to try to absorb both Jones' and Mar-Vell's brains, using their bodies as receptacles for its own consciousness in a direct assault against Earth. However, the heroes resisted and managed to escape, and Captain Marvel abandoned the Kree empire permanently.\n\nWhile back on Earth, Mar-Vell wandered independently for a time. He worked at an observatory, became involved with the Defenders for a day, and again teamed up with the Avengers against Thanos. Thanos’ corruption of his home, the moon Titan, pitted the Eternals against the world-computer ISAAC, and Captain Marvel helped the Eternals restore order. During this time, he fell in love with the Eternal’s Elysius, and they began a relationship that spanned both Titan and Earth and many shared adventures.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe Death of Captain Marvel\n\n&nbsp;\n\nUltimately, Captain Marvel’s earlier exposure to the nerve gas proved cancerous, and the cancer turned malignant. Mar-Vell spent his last days on Titan, the moon of Saturn, surrounded by Elysius and his friends Mentor and Starfox. Many of his allies came to visit him while on his deathbed including the Thing, Spider-Man, Drax the Destroyer, and an ambassador of the Skrull empire (the greatest enemies of the Kree Empire) who awarded Mar-Vell with the Skrull medal of valor and stated that Captain Marvel was considered to be the greatest single enemy the Skrull Empire had ever known. He was also granted a posthumous honorary membership in the Avengers, and a monument was erected in his memory on Titan.\n\nHis heroic legacy continued first with his son, Genis-Vell, conceived by Elysius who impregnated herself with Mar-Vell's cloned DNA, and later Phyla-Vell, a daughter from an alternate reality whose history became folded into reality after a time warp. Monica Rambeau has also used the alias of Captain Marvel, and Hulkling of the Young Avengers has since been revealed to be the son of Captain Marvel and Princess Annelle of the Skrull Empire.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe Return\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen Tony Stark, Hank Pym, and Reed Richards began construction on a prison within the Negative Zone, their activities caused a wrinkle in space-time. Encountering the wrinkle in the past, Captain Marvel touched it and was transported through time to the Negative Zone in the present day. Initially unsure of how to approach the situation, the heroes revealed Mar-Vell's history to him but also offered him a place in this new future as a warden for their prison, at least until, as the Sentry implicated, Mar-Vell would return to his past. Shaken by the experience and realization of his own fate, Mar-Vell nevertheless took up the Nega Bands once more to serve as Captain Marvel.\n\nUnfortunately, this individual turned out to be a Skrull sleeper agent programmed to believe he was the real Captain Marvel. He was sent to destroy Thunderbolts Mountian, but his programming had so completely overtaken his original personality that he killed the Skrull agents who were sent to terminate him and destroyed several Skrull ships, ending his own life in the process. He did the original Mar-Vell proud as he gave his life to defend Earth during the Skrulls' Secret Invasion. The real Captain Marvel never actually been raised.",

Encountering the Cosmic Man, a renamed and newly empowered Midas, Noh-Varr immediately shot him in the head, which barely affected him. As Cosmic Man toyed with Noh-Varr, Exterminatrix used the decapitated Mindless One's head to shunt her father into the Dark Dimension, where he was attacked and seemingly killed by a large horde of the Mindless Ones. While Exterminatrix mourned her father, S.H.I.E.L.D. captured Noh-Varr and dragged him away to the Cube, a giant prison for super-villains, which Noh-Varr promised would be the capital of the new Kree empire within five months.\nHe is Currently taking the Name Captain Marvel and joined the Avengers.",

      "biography": "Captain U.K. was Myrr/Merlyn’s chosen agent on Earth-238, which descended into darkness under reality-warping mutant James Jaspers’ influence; Jaspers unleashed the Fury, a killer cybiote that slew the world’s super-beings. Linda joined the few survivors in a desperate last stand, but the Fury slaughtered them with methodical ease; realizing they couldn’t win, Linda’s husband Rick teleported Linda to another reality while the Fury murdered him. \nLinda reappeared on Earth-616 and abandoned her heroic identity; but when the 616 Jaspers began his rise to power, she warned her counterpart, Captain Britain (Brian Braddock), of the potential threat. She encountered the Fury (which had traveled to Earth-616), but Merlyn saved her, and Captain Britain and the alien Special Executive buried the cybiote beneath tons of rock. When Jaspers transformed Britain into a fascist state, Captain Britain confronted Jaspers while his ally Saturnyne cajoled Linda back into costume. The Fury fought and slew Jaspers, sustaining heavy damage, and nearly killed Captain Britain before a berserk Linda ripped it to pieces. Immediately thereafter, she joined Brian and Saturnyne in attending Merlyn’s funeral in Otherworld, headquarters of the Corps, agents of Merlyn like Brian and Linda. R.C.X. (Resources Control Executive) asked Linda to protect the Warpie children transformed by Jaspers’ reality warp. Captain Britain refused to assist, but his sister Betsy let R.C.X. move into Braddock Manor. When Brian left the country, Betsy took over as Captain Britain, mentored by Linda. Merlyn’s heir Roma informed Linda her anomalous presence on 616 was preventing the damaged reality from fully healing, and sent her to Earth-794 to overthrow the tyrant Opul Lun Sat-Yr9. Roma also reached back in time to rescue Rick from moments prior to his demise. After the couple deposed Sat-Yr9, Linda was reassigned to Earth-839, where she battled the Red Monarch. When the Corps tried Captain Britain for breaching their rules, Linda was his defense council and sole ally. After this dispute was resolved, Linda explained the source of the Corps’ powers to Brian before returning to 839. She returned to 616 for Meggan’s hen night, then attended Brian and Meggan’s wedding. When Sat-Yr9 regained control of Earth-794, Roma sent Linda, the 616 X-Men and the Corps to apprehend her, after which they opposed Dr. Doom of 616. Later Linda fought alongside the Corps against the 616 Fantastic Four. When the Corps defended Otherworld from the computer Mastermind’s Warpie army, Linda fled to enlist Brian’s aid, returning with Brian to repulse the invasion. Recently, Linda helped Brian and Meggan seal an interdimensional breach that would have spread the “House of M” reality warp across the multiverse.",

      "biography": "Captain Universe is the identity which has been assumed by each of the hundreds of beings who have been empowered by the Uni-Power, a mysterious energy source originating from the extraterrestrial dimension known as the Microverse. The creation of the Microverse was engineered by the Makers, giant beings resembling Celestials, though the details of their involvement are uncertain.\n\nA million years ago, a time traveler named Prince Wayfinder defended Earth from an invasion by evil Whirldemons. Using the cosmic power of the enigmatic Sword in the Star, Wayfinder opened an one-dimensional/temporal portal, created the Microverse to provide a new home for his people and bound the demons, preventing their entry into the Microverse. The Sword in the Star bonded with Prince Wayfinder, transforming itself into the Enigma Force with Wayfinder as its guardian. In times of distress, the Enigma Force manifests the Uni-Power, which selects a host, surrounding them with a field of energy which transforms them into the costumed Captain Universe, and imparts to them some of the knowledge they will need to yield their powers. The Uni-Power occasionally communicates with the host personally in cases where the host needs guidance, or when the Uni-Power has a specific agenda.\n\nThe first known human to yield the Uni-Power was Gilbert Wiles, who became Captain Universe to help stop a plane hijacking. When the crises was over, Wiles lost the power, but was so overwhelmed by the experience that he devoted himself to studying the Uni-Power, hoping to regain it. The next known host was astronaut Ray Coffin, who had entered the Microverse through the Prometheus Pit, a portal on Earth leading to that dimension. The Time Traveler requested Coffin’s aid against the evil Baron, a Microverse tyrant who sought to conquer both dimensions, and bestowed the Captain Universe power upon him. Coffin drove the Baron from Earth, and the Prometheus Pit was sealed. Coffin then lost his powers.\n\nWhen Mister E, a native of the Shadow Realm, attempted to turn Earth’s sun into a black star, the Uni-Power manifested itself in Coffin again to face the threat, but the strain on Coffin caused a heart attack. The Uni-Power chose his teenage son Steve Coffin instead, and Steve defeated Mister E. The Uni-Power later empowered twin siblings, homemaker Ann Stanford and private detective Clare Dodgson, who shared the Captain Universe powers to defeat the crime-lord Nemesis, revealed to be Ann’s own husband. The Uni-Power entered cat burglar Monty Walsh, who had been shot by agents of the gangster Guido Carboni. Walsh succeeded in bringing down Carboni and hoped to use the Captain Universe powers to become a crime boss, but when the Uni-Power left him, he apparently died from his gunshot wounds.\n\nWhen the Microverse was imperiled by a merging with Earth-616’s dimension caused by the reawakened Whirldemons, Wayfinders descendent Arcturus Rann and Earth’s sorcerer supreme Dr. Strange found Wayfinder’s tomb, and the Sword in the Star empowered them both to become a merged Captain Universe. They used the Uni-Power to halt Earth’s merging with the Microverse, and were restored to their own bodies when the crises ended. When a crazed military officer named Jamie Custer attempted to launch a nuclear missile, the Uni-Power transformed Bruce Banner (Hulk) into Captain Universe. Banner’s other self, the Hulk, manifested itself as a separate entity, and its natural enmity to Banner led to a struggle between the two, but Banner finally destroyed the missile and neutralized the fallout. When the Uni-Power left Banner, he and Hulk remerged with each other.\n\nAn unidentified female Captain Universe was among the heroes of Earth assembled by the Grandmaster to serve as potential participants in his game against Death, but she was not selected. Later, young student Delayne Masters became Captain Universe to save his teacher from a schoolyard bully named Willie Johnson. Although the Uni-Power left Delayne before he had beaten Willie, Delayne had gained enough confidence from the experience that he was able to defeat Willie on his own. The Uni-Power once transformed physics professor Evan Swann into Captain Universe to halt the Quantum Mechanic, an extraterrestrial who believed that the law of probability was a flaw in reality that should be corrected by breaking the Earth down into subatomic particles, Swann destroyed the Quantum Mechanic to save the Earth.\n\nThe Uni-Power’s next known recipient was Peter Parker, secretly Spider-Man. When the Uni-Power first possessed Parker, he was struck by electricity in a laboratory accident while working with professor Max Lubisch. The accident blocked some of the Uni-Power’s energy from reaching Parker and he mistakenly believed that his increased powers were a result of the accident. Spider-Man found himself facing increased threats from super-villains due to Loki’s so called “Acts of Vengeance!” conspiracy, in which the villain community traded opponents, and he found he needed his new powers to face the Trapster, Titania, Magneto, the Brothers Grimm, Goliath, the Hulk, the Rhino, Shocker, Hydro-Man, TESS-One, Dragon Man, Terminus and Graviton. When Loki’s plot was foiled by Earth’s heroes, he attempted new mischief by merging three Sentinels into the Tri-Sentinel. This proved to be the threat the Uni-Power had chosen Spider-Man for, and he gained full access to the Uni-Power. With the Tri-Sentinels defeat, the Uni-Power departed, and Parker found himself wiser for the experience, having remained true to himself even with the cosmic powers of Captain Universe. Peter’s tenure as Captain Universe led to further troubles when nearly all of his foes from “Acts of Vengeance” returned for rematches; he was also kidnapped along with other former Captain Universe hosts by the Psycho-Man, a tyrant of the Microverse who was after the Uni-Power, but Spider-Man and his fellow prisoners escaped and defeated him.\n\nAnother Captain Universe was a toddler named Eddie Price, chosen to end the threat of the demons Gart and Rath. Later, time-traveling members of the Guardians of the Galaxy visited the modern era, and they attempted an attack upon the Badoon, hoping to prevent the Badoon invasion of their own timeline. To prevent this, the Uni-Power transformed a Badoon named L’Matto into Captain Universe to defeat the Guardians. The Guardians’ absent leader Major Victory came to aid them alongside Dr. Strange, and Dr. Strange forced the Uni-Power to depart L’Matto so that the Guardians could escape back to their own time.\n\nThe Uni-Power’s next known host was the paralyzed Elijah Jackson. When he became Captain Universe to save his daughter from attackers, his paralysis was temporarily healed and he had a chance to express his love for his daughter before the Uni-Power departed, restoring him to his paralyzed condition. Though accounts vary, perhaps due to reality distortion, a University of Tennessee veterinary student became Captain Universe to aid the X-Men against the mutant Roger Fieldston, who was using his power to mutate others. Captain Universe used the Uni-Power to reverse Fieldston’s powers so that he could heal everyone he affected in his rampage.\n\nAn unusual Captain Universe was Roland Taylor, a schizophrenic writer. The Uni-Power healed his mind, but he found himself pursued by Division U, a scientific team trying to analyze the Uni-Power, whose ranks included Steve Coffin, angered to find another person with his one-time powers. The Uni-Power was also pursued by the Enigma Hunters, extraterrestrials from the Microverse who sought its powers for themselves. When the Uni-Power tried to leave Taylor, his schizophrenic side reasserted itself, forcing the Uni-Power to remain. The Uni-Power eventually departed from Taylor through unrevealed circumstances.\n\nThe Uni-Power went on to possess police officer Ted Simmons, but it began to suffer inexplicable power fluctuations. While Simmons was battling gunmen, the Uni-Power briefly deserted him, and one of Simmons’ fellow officers was shot dead as a result. The Uni-Power could not understand what had happened to it, and began to search for answers. Needing more power, it also began to seek individuals who were already superhuman so that it could duplicate their powers.\n\nIt first returned to Bruce Banner, this time possessing him and the Hulk as a single entity. They sought out Gilbert Wiles, who was still researching the Uni-Power, and he attempted to assist it, but agents of A.I.M. made an attempt on the Uni-Power, and while the empowered Hulk fought them, an invisible A.I.M. agent killed Wiles’ business partner, David Garrett. To help clear Gilbert’s name, the Uni-Power joined with Matthew Murdock, alias Daredevil, who had taken Wiles as his client. Bonding with the Uni-Power enhanced Daredevil’s superhuman senses to such a degree that he could barely function, but he also regained his eyesight as a result. Murdock proved Wiles’ innocence in court, and suggested that the Uni-Power attempt to study A.I.M.’s findings on its situation, hoping it might shed light on the power fluctuations.\n\nTo invade an A.I.M. base, the Uni-Power joined with the mutant X-23 (Laura Kinney), who was sympathetic to the Uni-Power’s plight, having been a victim of experimentation herself. They were also assisted by the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Scorpion (Carmilla Black), and destroyed all of A.I.M.’s intelligence on the Uni-Power in the hopes that they would cease pursuing it. The Uni-Power sought aid from Fantastic Four leader Mr. Fantastic, but the Four were attacked by Gladiator (Kallark) of the Shi’ar Imperial Guard, who believed that the Uni-Power’s fluctuations made it a threat to the universe. The Uni-Power possessed the Invisible Woman to hold off Gladiator, and finally joined with Gladiator briefly so that he could see its recent fluctuations were uncontrolled. Gladiator offered to bring the Uni-Power back to the Shi’ar with him to seek answers.\n\nAs they traveled to the Shi’are empire, Gladiator and the Uni-Power were captured by Krosakis, an extraterrestrial who fed upon cosmic energies, and he forced the Uni-Power to bond with him so that he could have its power. The Silver Surfer (Norrin Radd) sensed the Uni-Power’s distress and came to its aid. In battle with Krosakis, the Surfer was able to drive the Uni-Power from his body. The Uni-Power then bonded with the Surfer, and he was able to use his Power Cosmic to halt the fluctuations temporarily. After freeing Gladiator and Krosakis’ other slaves, the Surfer brought the Uni-Power to Gabriel Vargas, a soldier who had been crippled while on a tour of duty. The Uni-Power chose Vargas as its new host while it continued to investigate its power fluctuations.",

      "biography": "Carnage was once a serial killer known as Cletus Kasady, and became Carnage after merging with the offspring of the alien symbiote called Venom&nbsp;during a prison breakout. The symbiote amplified his psychotic nature making him even less mentally stable than he had been previously, and therefore even more dangerous. An interesting note is that, unlike Venom, Carnage is a singular entity, referring to himself as \"I\" instead of \"We\", because the symbiote has actually merged into Kasady's bloodstream. Carnage is also the \"father\" of&nbsp;Toxin. A note on his childhood: Cletus' father killed his wife (Cletus' mother) because she tried to kill Cletus. Cletus then testified in court against him, saying that he killed her for no reason, causing him to die by electric chair as means of punishment. It is also unclear on Cletus' relationship with his mother, as he seems to have feelings for her, causing him to dig up her grave at the end of his massacre through New York. He also revealed that he killed his grandmother when he was younger, pushing her down a flight of stairs. Since the alien symbiote adapts to the host's personality, the Carnage symbiote is affected by Kasady's insane mind and lust for destruction.\n\nKasady has been separated and re-attached to the symbiote multiple times. The Carnage symbiote has occasionally attached itself to other hosts, including the&nbsp;Silver Surfer,&nbsp;Ben Reilly&nbsp;(a clone of&nbsp;Spider-Man), and&nbsp;Doctor Octopus. Venom later decided to absorb the Carnage symbiote \"for good\", during which Kasady retained the Carnage persona by costuming himself in red paint and continuing his killing sprees (albeit as a powerless human). This was short lived, however, as Kasady coincidentally found an exact replica of the symbiote in the Negative Zone. As to whether or not the symbiote is a separate entity, \"permanently\" bonded, or his own blood mutated, has not been revealed. The symbiote once chose to leave Kasady and bond with Ben Reilly. Kasady, without the symbiote, rapidly aged and his body quickly deteriorated. In this state, Kasady was barely able to function, having a hard time operating a sink, let alone being a threat. The symbiote bonded with him again in time to save his life, regenerating his health. When the symbiote abandoned him yet again, this time to join with the&nbsp;Silver Surfer(transforming him into the Carnage Cosmic), Kasady was left dying from an accelerated form of stomach cancer (apparently a side-effect of the symbiosis, also suffered by Eddie Brock, the original Venom). However, when Venom ate the symbiote, he did not deteriorate, indicating that perhaps some fragments of the symbiote were left behind (enough to sustain him but not enough to form the costume). This may be backed up by the fact that Kasady seemed to retain at least some enhanced strength.\n\nLater, Venom and Spider-Man had to team up to stop Carnage. During this time it was revealed that the symbiote had become a part of Kasady's blood and was irremovable from him. Kasady only needed to be cut for the symbiote to flood out to become Carnage once again. Unlike Venom, Carnage had become less vulnerable to the high-pitched sounds which would normally stop Venom, however he was still vulnerable to intense heat.\n\nRecently, Carnage was one of many super-villains trying to escape from the Raft. He tried to kill couple helpless civilians who were there to meet another inmate called&nbsp;Sentry. Who then intervened and flew Carnage outside of the Earth's atmosphere, where he ripped him apart. Kasady was presumably killed and has not been seen since.",

      "biography": "Shen Kuei is a man based in Hong Kong who dealt in espionage and counterespionage and who became known as Cat because of his cunning, stealth, and mysteriousness. At on time he worked for the People's Republic of China.Sir Denis Nayland Smith, an agent of the British intelligence agency MI-6, asked his ally, the martial arts master Shang-Chi, to go to Hong Kong to stop Cat's operations and to recover certain documents from him that had been stolen from British intelligence. Smith warned Shang-Chi that the life of a British counterpart was in danger from Cat. Shang-Chi accepted the mission.However, Smith was unaware both that Cat had left the employ of the Communist Chinese and that the British counteragent, a woman named Juliette, had fallen in love with Cat. Juliette told Shang-Chi where to find the documents but said she wanted to stay in Hong Kong with Cat. Shen Kuei, however, wrongly believed that Juliette had betrayed him to Shang-Chi and that Shang-Chi had been sent to assassinate him. Enraged, Cat intended to kill them both. Shang-Chi obtained the paper that Smith wanted, only to be told by the man he took them from that they were not stolen from the British after all. Believing him, the disillusioned Shang-Chi threw the papers away. However, the papers did indeed belong to British intelligence and described the activities of Shang-Chi's father, Fu Manchu, a major threat to the world's security. Cat and Shang-Chi, both consummate masters of the martial arts, battled each other until Juliette, to stop the fight, plunged a knife into shoulder. Horror struck and guilt-ridden, Cat broke off the fight and went to Juliette, begging her forgiveness. He threw a knife to Shang-Chi, giving him the opportunity to kill him. But Shang-Chi spared Cat's life and returned to London.Shen Kuei and the master criminal Kogar became partners to obtain the plans for a neutron bomb. But then the partnership ended, and Shen Kuei, again working for the Communist Chinese, acquired the plans for them. The relationship between Juliette and Shen Kuei had ended: she felt his love for her had lessened, and she believed his current work for the Communist Chinese was \"evil\" although she did not know exactly what he was doing for them. Finally, Shen Kuei had taken a new lover, the mercenary Pavane; Juliette herself fell in love with another mercenary, Skull-Crusher. Juliette decided to help Kogar hijack the barrels containing microdots with the bomb plans from Shen Kuei's men. However, Kogar tricked her into leaving a barrel containing explosives which killed Shen Kuei's brother, the owner of the Jade Peacock, a Hong Kong nightclub.Eventually, Cat and Shang-Chi both arrived at Kogar's secret base. There Cat accused Kogar of treachery and demanded a trial by combat. Kogar chose Shang-Chi, who had just infiltrated Kogar's organization, to act as his champion. Hence Cat and Shang-Chi again met in combat, but during the fight, Cat learned that it was Kogar, not Shang-Chi, who was responsible for his brother's death, and broke off the duel. Shang-Chi destroyed the plans for the neutron bomb, and he and Cat joined forces to destroy Kogar's base with explosives.Cat decided to work no longer for any governments. He learned of a German ship that sank off Hong Kong during World War II and that it contained research papers and canisters of a rare substance, both of which would make possible the construction of an effective long-range particle beam weapon. Cat decided to obtain the papers and canisters and to destroy them before any government could make use of them. Shang-Chi's lover, Leiko Wu, was sent by MI-6 to obtain the papers and canisters, but she began an affair with Cat and chose to aid him in destroying the information and canisters. Shang-Chi agreed with Cat's goal once he learned of it. Cat recovered the papers and canisters from the German ship, destroyed the papers, and buried the canisters. He confessed to Wu that he was still in love with Juliette, who now worked for him, and Wu told him she still loved Shang-Chi. Not realizing that Shang-Chi sympathized with his destruction of the particle beam secret, Cat battled him, but their fight ended when Leiko and Juliette aimed guns at each other, threatening to fire them if the battle continued. Leiko returned to Shang-Chi and Juliette returned to Cat. Cat had the German ship destroyed. Chen Kuei and Shang-Chi parted as respectful allies.",

Catseye was abandoned at birth, presumably due to her very visible feline mutation, and was raised by a cat who acted as her surrogate mother.  In fact, Catseye originally thought herself to be a cat with the ability to take human form until she was found by Frost. Given the name Sharon Smith by Frost, the young mutant soon became emotionally attached to Frost, regarding her as a new surrogate mother.Smith's youth and comparative lack of sophistication belie a ferocious intelligence.  She was capable of total recall from her photographic memory, and instinctively knew when she was being lied to.  Under Frost's tutelage, Smith progressed from total illiteracy to upper grade school reading levels in less than a year.  She still retained several feline qualities whilst in human form, having been forced to provide for herself since earliest infancy.Catseye was killed when her life-force was drained by the time-traveling Trevor Fitzroy following his assault on the Hellfire Club. Recently, Catseye was revived with an alien techno organic virus.",

It was also at that time Century decided to travel back into space, with the Broker as his prisoner, in order to find out more of his past and to return those who the Broker enslaved back to their home worlds. It was only when he left Earth that Century realized he missed Force Works and was in love with the Scarlet Witch. However, it wasn’t long before things went horribly wrong. Soon after one of the Broker’s Bodyguard Cadre members, Kiwi, was brought back to his home planet, Century was summoned to the bridge of the starship only to be attacked by those he just recently saved. The Broker had used Tyrmean Brain Stem Parasites to once again enslave the crew and even Century as well in order to sell him off to a perspective buyer in need of a dimensional teleporter. The Broker and his slaves took Century to the moon of Memoriam which orbits the long-dead planet of Century’s people, the Hodomur. As they waited planet side for the customer to arrive, the Broker all who were present the reason for Century’s creation. It seems that Century was created to be a tool for vengeance against an evil being called Lore. Lore had visited Century’s home world and laid waste to it, but it was The Scatter who ultimately finished the planet off. Century was to be the Hodomur ultimate warrior, a mixture of 100 of the strongest and most able survivors and was given a 100-year lifespan (how much of it has been spent is unknown to Century) to hunt and finally destroy Lore. It was during that time the Broker found and captured Century and erased his mission of vengeance from his mind so that he would be more subservient. The Broker eventually sold Century to The Scatter so he could track Lore and find all of the injured worlds she left in her wake so that The Scatter could feed off the rest of the planet. Century led The Scatter to many worlds, all of which they destroyed, including the world of Prashard, the home of another of the Broker’s slaves, Skewer. When Skewer heard this, he attacked but was put down by the Broker right before the arrival of Imogen, Century’s new owner. Teleporting Imogen and her party, a being called Nohm and two Gene-Batch Warclones, to another dimension, Century soon came in contact with a being he recognizes but does not know why.  A woman called Azimuth saved the foreigners from being annihilated by the local inhabitants and transported them to her stronghold. Once there, the true goal of Imogen’s interest in Century was revealed. An ancient artifact of immense power known as The Crucible was shown to the strange visitors, and then Azimuth destroyed the parasite that caused Century to be a slave and gave him back free will. It was at that time Azimuth was going to reveal information about the mysterious Imogen to Century, but was never allowed to do so. Imogen ruthlessly attacked Azimuth, and even though Century rallied to help her, it was too late. Azimuth was left catatonic, and Imogen had possession of The Crucible. Her victory was almost thwarted by the sudden arrival of the Broker who followed her to this strange dimension, so he could possess what Imogen was after and reclaim Century as his own once again. The Broker took three of his slaves with him, including Skewer, into the stronghold but, back on the ship, another slave, Slug, was implementing a plan to stop him. Slug destroyed the control link between Broker and the parasites so that the slaves would be free again even at the cost of his own life. Once the slaves heard the news, they turned on their former master and Skewer drew first blood. The Broker managed to kill two of the others, but it was Century who dealt the final blow when he separated the Broker’s head from his body. In the confusion, Imogen fled with The Crucible and Century never found out what Azimuth was going to tell him. Century and the others left that dimension taking Nohm and one of the Warclones with them. When asked where he wanted to go next, Century claimed he wanted to go back to his home on Earth.Century made a timely arrival at Force Works headquarters and saved Rachel Carpenter from Cybermancer and a corrupted Iron Man. Century also discovered what Iron Man, along with Immortus (in the guise of Kang), had planned for the Earth and informed his teammates about it right before joining the Avengers at Avengers Mansion. There the Avengers opposed the Anachronauts, and Century used his battle staff, Parallax, to guide a small group of Avengers back in time to enlist the help of a young Tony Stark. After helping the Avengers defeat Immortus, Century returned with the rest of Force Works to their base where the group was attacked by Wonder Man and Ultron of the evil Cybermancer’s time line. Ultimately, Cybermancer, Wonder Man and Ultron all suffered the same fate as their doomed reality despite the offer of help from the Scarlet Witch and, after that episode, Force Works decided to disband. Century decided he would travel the Earth and learn more of his adopted home until an urgent situation in Washington state was displayed on the Force Works Chaos computer. Century joined Force Works on their last mission and it can be assumed that, after the task was complete, Century began exploring his new home. The current whereabouts of Century are unknown at this time.",

      "biography": "Jonothon Starsmore and his girlfriend Gayle Edgerton were at a London nightclub when his mutant ability erupted in an explosion of psionic energy. The blast tore a hole in his body from his mouth to his navel, destroying several of his major internal organs including his heart and lungs, and also crippled Gayle’s legs. Jono survived the manifestation, though his body had been transformed into a “chamber” of volatile energy. Horrified, Jono fled. Denied a normal existence, Jono had developed a bleak outlook on life when he was invited by Charles Xavier to join the reopened Massachusetts Academy as a member of the mutant trainees Generation X. Accepting the offer, Jono arrived in the United States and was attacked at the airport by the energy vampire Emplate, who was driven off by the arrival of Chamber’s new teammates and their teachers, Banshee and Emma Frost. Adopting the codename Chamber, Jono resided in the Academy’s basement, remaining apart from his teammates. His control over his powers suffered a setback when he accidentally destroyed the girls’ dormitory in a panic after being kissed by his then-inebriated teammate, Husk (Paige Guthrie). Jono soon began romancing Paige, and single-handedly defeated Omega Red before confronting his old flame Gayle, who sought revenge on Jono. Gayle had struck a deal with Emplate to empower her, allowing her to capture Jono while Emplate’s other recruits, whom he named his Hellions, captured the rest of Generation X excepting M, who sought aid from the X-Men’s Bishop. Emplate ultimately reneged on his deal with Gayle, holding her prisoner alongside Generation X. After Emplate was defeated, Jono and Gayle reconciled their differences.Jono was briefly abducted by the psionic entity Onslaught, causing him trouble in focusing his powers. En route to the Xavier Institute for help, Jono and his teammate Skin were waylaid by the vigilante X-Cutioner, whom Skin defeated. After the X-Men defeated Onslaught, Jono’s focus returned, and he accompanied Paige to her family’s farm for a Thanksgiving holiday which ended with the pair’s romance breaking down. After being captured and imprisoned by Banshee’s cousin Black Tom Cassidy, the team encountered Glorian, a shaper of dreams, who granted the team their innermost desires. For Jono, it was to be whole once more; however, after Skin cast doubt on Glorian’s interpretations, the effects faded. Soon after, Jono and Paige reconciled while facing the Prime Sentinels of the government-sponsored anti-mutant Operation: Zero Tolerance.Generation X subsequently joined an other-dimensional group of superhuman teens in opposing Emplate and Professor Pretorious. Jono, alongside Husk and Skin, then joined Spider-Man against Major Love and his Direct Euthanasia Action Division, during which Jono used his psionic powers to enhance Spider-Man’s precognitive “spider-sense” to prevent Love from massacring a crowd of innocents. Jonothan also faced the Circus of Crime, who were actually seeking to reform; Nanny and the Orphan-Maker; an alliance between Emplate and Chimera which was foiled with the aid of mutant possessor Dirt Nap; and Emma’s former business rival, Bianca LaNiege. Later, when the X-Man Psylocke was tricked by the Shadow King into releasing a telepathic pulse, Jono lost his telepathic speech, rendering him effectively mute. The effects of the pulse eventually wore off, and Jono’s speech returned just before he and his teammates faced Dracula. During the encounter, Dracula briefly restored Jono’s face and body before biting him; however, Jono’s powers seemingly allowed him to reject the vampire lord’s influence.After the Academy began accepting human students, Jono was unhappily forced to pass as a mute burn victim. More threats followed, with Jono and his teammates battling the cyber-morph Paradox; joining former X-Men member Maggott in opposing exotic hunter Constantine Slaughter; allying with X-Man (Nate Grey) against the Dark Beast and his Gene Nation; rescuing their teacher Banshee from Hunter Brawn and his super-powered bodyguard Legault; opposing the Rising Sons in Madripoor alongside the mercenary Paladin; another battle with Emplate; resisting an attempt by Emma’s psychotic sister Adrienne to kill them; fighting alongside the New Warriors against the mutated Biohazard; facing the triple threat of Black Tom Cassidy, the Juggernaut and the mutant Mondo; and opposing Warden Coffin’s House of Correction. Following the death of Banshee’s love Moira MacTaggert and his turning to alcohol for solace, as well as Emma’s increasingly disturbing behavior, the students left the Academy, effectively forcing the school’s closure. Jono had received an invitation from Charles Xavier to graduate to the ranks of the X-Men, which he declined, choosing instead to return to London. There, he saved teen pop sensation Sugar Kane from a mob of adoring fans and briefly romanced her before she admitted she was only using his mutant status to boost her career. Jono reconsidered Xavier’s offer and joined the X-Men, and was reunited with several of his former Generation X teammates who had joined their former teacher Banshee’s new paramilitary X-Corps unit. His fling with Sugar Kane having made headlines, Jono’s reunion with Paige was awkward at best.At Cyclops’s request, Chamber enrolled in Empire State University’s pro-mutant program to investigate the deaths of mutant students on campus after a bombing of the co-species Students for Tolerance organization. Chamber discovered that the boyfriend of the group’s leader, Gigi Martin, had caused the blast to martyr her dead friends, thus furthering her organization’s cause. Though ESU dismantled the pro-mutant program, they retained one mutant student at the request of the Xavier Institute, who in turn took in a human student, Jono’s wheelchair-bound ESU roommate Walter. Jono sought to be taken off field duty with the X-Men to concentrate on a career in teaching; however, on returning to the Institute, he was shocked to discover that Paige had joined the team and was dating their teammate Archangel. Soon after, Jono volunteered to infiltrate the subversive Weapon X program, using his former relationship with Husk as a means to create public dissent between himself and the X-Men and attract the attention of Weapon X director Brent Jackson. Jono was recruited into the program and, as an incentive to stay, had his face and body reconstructed with technology that was linked to his mutant energy. For his first mission, Jono was tasked with assassinating John Sublime, founder of the mutant-harvesting U-Men. Despite having reservations about killing, Jono completed his mission, seemingly solidifying Jackson’s trust in him. Soon after, Jono went missing while seeking to close down Weapon X’s secret mutant concentration camp “Neverland.”Chamber seemingly resurfaced in Los Angeles, his face and chest once again shattered, and joined the former teen-hero support group Loners. However, it was soon revealed that a member of the criminal group the Pride was using Chamber’s identity to infiltrate the Loners and prevent them from capturing the Pride’s runaway children. Recently, following the House of M|warping of reality by the mutant Scarlet Witch, Jono was one of many mutants who were depowered after reality was restored. As a result, the Weapon X technology that had restored his face and body ceased working, leaving him in critical condition on life support. He was the subject of a focus piece by Sally Floyd, reporter for The Alternative, the first in a series of former mutants, and the column quickly became a national sensation.Recently, however, Chamber was kidnapped from his hospital room by agents of Apocalypse, who were now working for the ages-old mutant's right-hand man, Ozymandias. It was revealed that the Starsmores were in fact descendants of Apocalypse. Chamber was transformed into a scrawny, teenaged version of Apocalypse, and was asked to join their secret society. Chamber respectfully declined. Soon afterward, he was approached by Pete Wisdom, in hopes of recruiting him to the most recent incarnation of Excalibur. This time, Starsmore angrily rebuked Wisdom. He then joined the new team of New Warriors lead by Bandit",

      "biography": "Dmitri Smerdyakov was the illegitimate son of the patriarch of the Russian Kravinoff family and a servant. His only friend growing up was Joe Cord, an American boy who once saved his life while his half-brother Sergei, the legitimate heir, and his father treated him with contempt and brutality. This scarred Dmitri so deeply that he repressed his very identity and came to believe he had been friends with Sergei instead. His loss of self led him to become a master of disguise and a Soviet spy. Initially without super-powers, the Chameleon relied on his skills and a mixture of costumes and make-up to conceal his identity. He wore a multi-pocket disguise vest in which he kept the materials he would need to mask himself at short notice. In his first known appearance, Chameleon impersonated Professor Newton, a government scientist, to steal half of some missile defense plans. He then sent a message to Spider-Man, electronically contacting him via his spider-sense, requesting a meeting and implying a profitable venture. Chameleon disguised himself as Spider-Man, though, and stole the second half of the plans, making his escape just as the real wall-crawler showed up. Spidey was at first framed for the theft but managed to bring Chameleon back to the police. Chameleon disguised himself as a police officer, scaring Spider-Man off by having the other police attack him. Spidey left the scene, thinking he had failed, not realizing that he had torn Chameleon's police uniform, allowing the cops to see the phony Spider-Man outfit underneath. Chameleon was deported back to Russia, but returned soon after, having given up being a spy, and turned instead to a life of crime. Stymied again by the wall-crawler, Chameleon invited his half-brother, now known as Kraven the Hunter, to America to capture Spider-Man. The duo worked together, with Chameleon even dressing as Kraven to fool Spidey. Ultimately, though, both were defeated and deported by freighter where they bribed a sailor to set them loose in a lifeboat near Long Island. They came ashore right by Tony Stark’s munitions factory and Kraven was quickly captured by Iron Man. Chameleon concealed his presence but decided to prove his superiority over Kraven by defeating the armored Avenger. Disguising himself as Captain America, Chameleon contacted Iron Man and convinced him that he was the real Captain America and that the Captain America at Avengers Mansion was really Chameleon. Iron Man and Captain America fought it out until Giant-Man captured Chameleon and revealed the truth. Chameleon quickly escaped prison and went to work for the Leader as his top lieutenant. The Leader sent him to New Mexico to learn the secrets of the Hulk. There, Chameleon impersonated General Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross and Dr. Bruce Banner, stole a grenade-size gamma bomb and took Betty Ross as a hostage. Realizing he couldn't escape, Chameleon set off the bomb, which was smothered by the Hulk, dampening the blast. Though caught in the rubble, Chameleon survived and escaped, remaining in the Leader's employ until his boss' supposed death.Chameleon next encountered Spider-Man after taking the place of Captain George Stacy who had been hired to protect a valuable art exhibit at the Midtown Museum. Peter Parker and Stacy’s daughter Gwen were there and noticed that the Captain didn't seem to recognize them. After the exhibit was stolen and Stacy found drugged back at his apartment, Peter realized the Chameleon must have been involved. He persuaded Joe Robertson to plant a story in the Daily Bugle about a transfer of bonds and trapped Chameleon trying to steal them. Chameleon tried to escape through disguise but made the mistake of impersonating the one person Spider-Man knew to be a fake: Peter Parker. The terrorist organization Hydra arranged for Chameleon's escape from prison so that he could impersonate Dr. Henry Pym and steal Pym's research combating their biological weapon Virus Nine. Pym, as Ant-Man, teamed with the Hulk and thwarted Chameleon, though it appeared at the time that Chameleon had murdered Bruce Banner. Later, Chameleon impersonated Spider-Man, attempting to free his friend Joe Cord from the New York Men's Detention Center. Accidentally striking the Hulk with his car, Chameleon quickly disguised himself as Hulk's friend Rick Jones and convinced the green goliath to break Joe out of jail. However, in a battle with police, Joe protected Chameleon from gunfire and was killed. Designing a new costume that could instantly duplicate any clothing, Chameleon went back to crime. He was pursued after a jewel heist by Torpedo (Brock Jones) and Daredevil. His quick-changes failed to help him since Daredevil tracked him by his heartbeat. His next costume innovation used a holographic belt that stored the appearances of people he came into contact with and allowed him to take on their look. In one encounter, he managed to convince people that Spidey had attacked an old lady, leaving the wall-crawler's newly restored reputation in tatters. Later he obtained further powers by using a serum that could let him change his appearance at will. This liquid actually allowed his skin to be flexible enough to shift its appearance into any disguise Chameleon desired. He tried to kidnap a top scientist but was again thwarted by Spider-Man. Chameleon then set his sights on ruling the New York underworld. He kidnapped J. Jonah Jameson, impersonating him in a long-term bid to influence events through the Bugle, and formed an alliance with Hammerhead. The Kingpin of Crime was embroiled in a power struggle with the werewolf Lobo Brothers Carlos and Eduardo. Chameleon and Hammerhead tried to instigate a full-on gang war, from which they would pick up the pieces. Chameleon, posing as Jameson, injected Spider-Man with a potion that left him unconscious for several days. Recovering, Spider-Man went after Jameson and discovered he was the Chameleon all along. Hammerhead and Chameleon's plans continued as they ambushed the Lobo Brothers and Kingpin during peace talks. After carving up the city into territories they each agreed to control, their alliance collapsed and their influence waned. Soon after, Chameleon took the guise of Doctor Turner and persuaded Spider-Man to subject himself to a machine that supposedly would analyze his spider-powers. The machine, designed by the Tinkerer, ended up temporarily removing the wall-crawler's abilities instead. After discussing it with Mary Jane, Spider-Man decided to have his powers removed permanently. Now powerless, Spidey was attacked by Tarantula (Luis Alvarez) and Scorpion and needed the Black Cat's help to survive. Changing his mind, Spider-Man searched for Doctor Turner, eventually realizing he was actually Chameleon, by which time his powers returned naturally. The Chameleon's next big plan was set up by the Green Goblin (Harry Osborn) before his death. The Goblin persuaded Chameleon to create two robots that would appear to be Peter Parker's dead parents in an effort to get Peter to tell them who Spider-Man really was. The Goblin already knew Spidey's identity but wanted to mess with Peter's head so he convinced Chameleon that Parker, due to all the photos he had taken, was sure to know Spidey's identity. When Spider-Man discovered the fraud, he went crazy with rage and disappointment at losing his parents again. The Chameleon escaped to Kraven's old mansion while Spider-Man hunted him down. Faced with a more fearsome and vicious Spider-Man than ever before, Chameleon's repressed memories of his unhappy childhood with Sergei returned and he fell into a coma-like state. The Chameleon was taken to Ravencroft Institute but escaped after assuming the identity of his doctor, Ashley Kafka. He kidnapped Spider-Man and unmasked him, finally understanding why Spider-Man had been so mad after discovering the robot parents. Chameleon imprisoned Peter and convinced him he was a writer named Herbert Smith who was incarcerated in an insane asylum. Chameleon then took on the role of Peter himself but was foiled by Mary Jane, armed with a baseball bat, who knew her husband too well to fall for the impersonation. Escaping, he was shot by his nephew Alyosha Kravinoff, who said there could only be one Kravinoff in the world. Chameleon again barely survived. Later, he arranged to meet Spider-Man on top of the Brooklyn Bridge, wanting to make up for his crimes. There, he tried to commit suicide by jumping. Spider-Man blamed himself for this apparent death but Chameleon somehow survived. He was later recommitted to Ravencroft. In Chameleon’s twisted mind he now believes himself to be his half-brother, Kraven the Hunter. This didn’t stop him from joining Norman Osborn‘s Sinister Twelve, however.",

      "biography": "Charlie Weiderman was the one student at Midtown High School more bullied than Peter Parker. Even Peter took advantage of Charlie to score some points with the in-crowd before guilt led him to make friends with his scorned classmate, but Charlie, beaten by his father at home and humiliated at school, only sought revenge. First, he ingested a homemade version of Captain America's super-soldier formula, which only landed him in the hospital; later, he tried to pull a knife on his tormentors. When Charlie slashed his classmates' tires and lied about it, Ben Parker told him never to come see Peter again.As an adult, Charlie still searched for vindication. His father died and left him enough money to help fund the creation of a porous polymer compound that could completely cover a soldier and protect him from harm. Charlie eventually realized that his \"skinsuit\" would have to be composed of the energy-absorbing metal Vibranium to protect the wearer from any impacts. Charlie talked Peter into a letter of recommendation that swayed industrialist Tony Stark, who was aware of Spider-Man's true identity, into authorizing a large grant. When Peter saw Charlie's hasty shortcuts involving the volatile Vibranium, however, he wanted to pull the plug on the project. Frantic, Charlie rushed the procedure and the Vibranium blew up, encasing him in a skinsuit that bestowed the metal's properties on him. Attempting to duck responsibility, maddened by the chemicals in his suit and by Peter's insistence that he turn himself in, Charlie went on a rampage, locating and killing Rich and Sheila, a young married couple who had both ridiculed him back in high school, fighting Spider-Man, and planning to kill Peter's relatives Aunt May and Mary Jane. Unable to track down the Parkers, Charlie settled for destroying Peter's apartment and the family home in Forest Hills. Recalling that the fluid Vibranium could be made solid by the use of extreme pressure, Spider-Man forced Charlie into an atmospheric chamber at Stark International, causing the skinsuit to harden, immobilizing him inside. Although doctors can penetrate the suit enough to take care of Charlie's bodily needs, he remains trapped within. As Peter Parker and Tony Stark talked about a way to remove the skinsuit, tears fell from Charlie's frozen eyes.Charlie did regain some degree of speech and movement when he volunteered for Harry Osborn's Promethean Trials as a test subject for a chemical that will cure Harry's ex-brother-in-law Mark Raxton. The experiment is a success and Charlie is freed from the skinsuit.",

      "url": "https://www.marvel.com/characters/chthon",
      "image": "https://terrigen-cdn-dev.marvel.com/content/prod/1x/chthon.jpg",
      "biography": "Chthon is the archetypal Class One Demon, one of the Elder Gods created billions of years ago from the Demiurge, the sentient life force of Earth's biosphere, shaping the early development of Earth. Chthon, like his sister Gaea was born a god of the Earth, but he was not of the lifegiving soul that she was, instead Chthon was a being of the dark cold soul of the grave and the underworld. Chthon was Earth's first master of black magic, occupying his existence in the pursuit of knowledge of things which should not be. As with the majority of Elder Gods, Chthon began degeneration into a demonic state, and when the benevolent Gaea mated with the Demiurge and spawned Atum, Chthon saw the threat this new \"God-Killer\" posed. As Atum began killing those Elder Gods who had become corrupted, Chthon inscribed all of his dark knowledge into indestructable parchments which would come to be known as the Darkhold. Chthon then weaved a spell allowing him to escape to a new dimension, leaving the Darkhold behind to serve as a touchstone to his home.Trapped in this new realm, Chthon sired the N'Garai demons - including the masters (Kierrok, Syxa, the Triad (Y'Bsgloth, Y'Garon, Y'Griarth), etc.) and the unnamed warrior caste. Though the N'Garai have been able to return to the Earth dimension, Chthon himself was unable to. Acting through an elemental host called the Other, he granted power to the Darkhold's users, including the Atlanteans who would become the first vampires and later of the current incarnation of zombies (with the alliance of the voodoo god Sagbata (Baron Samedi)). All mortals who used the Darkhold forfeited their souls and were corrupted by Chthon, though Chthon was not a collector of souls like Mephisto, he instead used the mortals as pawns towards his own desire to return to Earth. The Darkhold was used by many including Babylonian savants, Egyptian priests, and Hebrew scholars. Chthon has also empowered or created numerous beings over the eons, including the Darkhold Dwarf, Diabolique's mother, Dragonus, Hellhound, Midwife, Monstrosity, Troids, Whisperer, and the Wish-Demon.In the 6th century, Morgan Le Fay bound the Darkhold parchments into a book and summoned Chthon to Earth, but soon realized he was too powerful to control. Even aided by Merlin, she could not drive him from Earth completely; they imprisoned a portion of Chthon within what would become Wundagore Mountain. Soon thereafter, Chthon's elemental host, the Other was summoned by Modred the Mystic, who resisted corruption until he had to sacrifice himself to save the woman he loved. Modred fell into a deep sleep and his master Gervaisse put him into an enchanted tomb knowing he would one day awake. The Other was fought off by Merlin and St. Brendan, who scattered the Darkhold's pages across the planet. The Darkhold was re-bound by the Mad Monk Aelfric in 1149 A.D. and passed through many hands, including sorcerers Cagliostro and Taboo and vampire Lord Ruthven. Many partial or complete copies of the Darkhold exist, including the Shiatra Book of the Damned and the diary of Grigori Russoff. The Vatican came to aquire at least one of these copies and sought to keep it away from the world, shut it away in their libraries under the protection of the Montesi family, priests of a supposedly uncorruptable bloodline who were allowed to have children to continue watching the Darkhold.In the 1930s, the High Evolutionary built his Citadel of Science atop Wundagore, which allowed Chthon to witness many scientific achievments of interest to him. Over 20 years later, Gregor Russoff summoned Chthon in hopes of curing his lycanthopy, but this led to the demon attempting once more to return to Earth. The Knights of Wundagore and the wizard Magnus drove him back; in parting, Chthon struck down Russoff and bonded to a newborn, the future Scarlet Witch. More recently, Vittorio Montesi, a priest, found he was sterile and used the Darkhold to father a child, Victoria who was more a child of Chthon himself than of the priest.In the modern era, Modred was awakened and Chthon took control of this pawn to capture the Scarlet Witch. The demon tried to return to Earth by taking over her, but her fellow heroes in the Avengers were able to rescue her. More recently, after a weakening of the mystical walls of the dimensions, Chthon sent the magical Dwarf to tempt others into using Darkhold pages, and Victoria Montesi was part of the \"Darkhold Redeemers\" opposing this activity. Among the many victims of temptation were Blade, Harvestor (Johnny Farmer), Mercy (Norman Zachos), and Spider-X. Chthon eventually gestated within Victoria, but Doctor Strange prevented him from being reborn on Earth by drawing on the goodness within Victoria's soul.",

      "biography": "John Watkins III is the grandson of the original Citizen V (John Watkins), a British officer who became a costumed hero to lead a group of citizens in fighting the Nazi forces of World War II as the V-Battalion. Years after the original Citizen V's death, the V-Battalion was revived by Roger Aubrey, formerly the hero known as the Destroyer. The Battalion became a clandestine watchdog group working to apprehend escaped war criminals and other villainous plots. Citizen V became the title for the Battalion's chief operative. John Watkins III inherited the title from his father and his grandmother.Due to the underground nature of the Battalion, the activities of Citizen V remained unknown to the world at large. At one point, Watkins was hospitalized after being wounded in the line of duty and was placed in a coma. During this time, Baron Zemo embarked on a plan to lead his team of Masters of Evil in masquerading as heroes to earn the trust of the world's governments. Zemo took the identity of Citizen V, claiming to be the grandson of the original hero. Eventually, however, Zemo revealed the truth during his attempt to take over the world, and he abandoned the identity.The V-Battalion hoped to take revenge on Zemo's appropriation of the Citizen V title. With Watkins still in a coma, they contacted Dallas Riordan and convinced her to take on the role. Eventually, Riordan became fed up with the Battalion's demands on her, and she abandoned the role as well. The Battalion hoped to reinstate Watkins and were surprised to find him recuperated. In fact, unknown to the Battalion, Zemo had managed to take over the mind of Watkins. (Zemo was believed to have died at the hands of Scourge, but in fact, Zemo survived due to a failsafe device engineered by his robotic associate Techno, a failsafe which transferred Zemo's consciousness to a computer at the moment of his death. Techno, out of a perverse sense of humor, then transferred Zemo's consciousness into Watkins' comatose body.)Zemo pretended to be the revived Watkins and assumed Watkins's former role as the leading agent of the V-Battalion, a role which brought him into contact with various members of the Avengers and the Thunderbolts, his former Masters of Evil. For a time, Zemo, as Citizen V, was offered leadership over the Redeemers, team of super-agents organized by the Commission on Superhuman Activities (the same organization that was manipulated to make Scourge).Shortly afterward, the Redeemers were confronted by the Thunderbolt's archenemy, Graviton, who proceeded to slaughter the heroes before attempting to reshape the world in his own image. Zemo escaped and decided to reactivate his former Thunderbolt teammates, who managed to fight Graviton to a standstill and revealed that the aliens known as the P'Tah were using Graviton's energies to open a portal to the P'Tah's dimension. The Thunderbolts fought back the P'Tah invasion, but it took Graviton's dying effort to cause the portal to implode, sending himself and the P'Tah back. At the same time, the V-Battalion tried to teleport Zemo out of the area. The combination of energies interfered with Zemo's presence in Watkins' mind. Watkins was teleported away, and Zemo's presence was shunted to the mechanical systems of the Fixer.Watkins resumed his role as Citizen V, later working with the Thunderbolts for the first time when he asked their members Hawkeye and Songbird to help the V-Battalion. The Battalion's ship, which was powered by an engine of alien technology, began distorting, threatening to suck the Earth into the null space of a white hole. The Thunderbolts ultimately plugged the void and shunted the alien ship from Earth, and in the process Baron Zemo and other Thunderbolts, believed lost in the battle with the P'Tah, were returned to Earth. Watkins hoped to bring Zemo to justice, but Zemo pointed out that he was already legally dead, and Watkins was forced to part company.As Citizen V, Watkins was instrumental in placating the anarchist Flag-Smasher as well as investigating his terrorist organization ULTIMATUM, which led to the discovery of Marduk, an ancient Sumerian god trapped in a human form for millennia.  Marduk hoped to cause massive loss of life and absorb the souls of the fallen combatants. In fact, due to a previous contact with Roger Aubrey, Marduk remotely took the soul of Aubrey, effectively killing him. Citizen V soon confronted Marduk and defeated him, releasing the souls he had stolen, reviving Aubrey.",

      "biography": "Clea was born the daughter of Prince Orini, legitimate heir to the rule of the Dark Dimension, and Umar, sister to the then-current ruler Dormammu. However, Umar was disgusted by her affair with Orini, abandoning Clea to be raised by him, and Prince Orini kept secret any knowledge of her true origins. Dormammu had long sought to conquer Earth and, as a result, often confronted Earth’s defender,Doctor Strange. When Doctor Strange journeyed into the Dark Dimension to continue his battle against Dormammu, he was aided by Clea, and the two quickly fell in love. On subsequent battles, Clea continued to help Doctor Strange, and their infatuation grew.Umar first gained control of the Dark Dimension when Dormammu was trapped in a pocket dimension after a battle with Doctor Strange and Eternity itself. Seeking revenge against Strange, Umar used Clea as a hostage. Doctor Strange rescued her, but his mentor the Ancient One convinced him that Clea would only be safe if she were sent to another pocket dimension. The couple agreed, even though they believed they might never see each other again. However, the dimension proved to be the same one that Dormammu was exiled to. Dormammu began to set plans in motion for his escape, but Doctor Strange thwarted his plans and rescued Clea in the process. Doctor Strange returned to Earth with Clea, and she lived with him in his Sanctum Sanctorum, becoming his lover and disciple. Over the years, she grew in her mystical potential and became nearly his equal in mystical aptitude. She joined him on many of his adventures, even as a member of his team, the Defenders, when the team helped defeat Dormammu from invading Earth on several occasions.Eventually, Clea left Earth to return to the Dark Dimension, in part because she believed that Doctor Strange’s heart belonged to Morgana Blessing. Umar had once again seized the throne from Dormammu, who was believed dead when his essence was scattered across several dimensions. Clea was determined to help the forces of rebellion in their attempt to overthrow her. Clea and Doctor Strange sought out Prince Orini, the true heir to the original ruler, Olnar, and Strange learned the truth of Clea’s birthright. Clea and Umar battled one-on-one, with Clea emerging triumphant and claiming rulership of the Dark Dimension. Umar and Orini, who remained loyal to her, were exiled to a pocket dimension. A short time into her reign, she and Doctor Strange were married in the Dark Dimension. When Dormammu reappeared, he won control over the Dark Dimension once again, forcing Clea to return to Earth once more. However, she grew uncomfortable in their relationship. Stronger and more capable, she no longer needed Doctor Strange as a mentor, and their relationship suffered.  Clea returned to the Dark Dimension and her role as leader of the resistance against him and his sister. Clea took a brief respite from the rebellion to come to Doctor Strange’s rescue. He and the original Defenders had become cursed to continually band together and, as a result, found themselves distancing themselves from humanity. They struck upon the idea that in order to have peace, they would enforce it by ruling the world. Hellcat and the support Defenders asked Clea and others to form a team to defeat the so-called Order, after which Doctor Strange and the Defenders were freed from their curse and Clea returned to the Dark Dimension.",

      "biography": "Identical quintuplets from a Chinese farming family, the brothers Tao-Yu were taken into government custody for study after their mutant nature manifested. The brothers were trained to control their power and became government agents as the Collective Man. The brothers were among the heroes of Earth gathered to partake in a “contest of champions” between the Grandmaster and Death itself. As an unwitting agent of Death, the Collective Man exhausted himself defeating Sasquatch, and they were returned to Earth after the encounter. The brothers later learned that their mother was dying. Determined to visit her, they took a helicopter, forcing the government to send Ho Ti, the Chinese God of Happiness, to reclaim them. The brothers opposed Ho Ti, who relented after sensing the happiness that the brothers’ mother felt on seeing her sons for the first time in twenty years before she died.The brothers subsequently returned to government service; however, their growing disdain over the government’s mistreatment of other mutants led them to join the Jade Dragon and Nuwa in forming 3-Peace. Allying themselves with Reignfire’s Mutant Liberation Front to free captive Chinese mutants, 3-Peace was ultimately betrayed by Reignfire to the government-sponsored China Force team, although they were able to escape. The brothers were then unwittingly drawn into a plot by the fallen god Marduk, who boosted their power to enable them to permanently absorb their countrymen’s collective life force and transfer it into the Genesis Well, thus allowing Marduk to re-empower himself. Opposed by Citizen V and the V-Battalion, the brothers combined and grew to giant size, liquefying the V-Battalion's council member Goldfire with a simple turn of their head. The brothers were seemingly killed when Citizen V used his Adamantium-coated sword to burst their engorged form, after which the V-Battalion gathered their remains in order to reverse-engineer their powers, allowing them to put the entire population of Rumekistan into a slumber so as to oppose Marduk’s plan.As a byproduct of their enhanced power, the brothers were eventually able to reform and returned to serving the Chinese government. When the X-Men traveled to China to investigate the mutant Shen Xorn, they were confronted by the brothers, who used their increased power to create a veritable army of Collective Men to oppose them.After the events of House of M|M-Day, many mutants all over the world lost their powers, but the Collective Man brothers, however, were one of the few mutants who retained theirs. The Collective Man was last seen on the Xavier Compound with other mutants.",

The Collector is obsessed with collecting items ranging from mystical artifacts and technological devices to animals and even entire civilizations.Though little is known of his early life or his long-dead native race, the Collector did have a family—a wife and daughter, Matani and Carina.

This motivation stemmed from his gift of prophecy, which foresaw coming threats to all life in the universe, including the Mad Titan Thanos who sought to destroy the universe.Fascinated by other races, cultures, and technologies, the Collector acquired and stored samples of these things in order to preserve them from the disasters he foresaw. He pursued this mission for countless years, until it became an obsession—his original motivation all but forgotten.

      "biography": "Growing up on his parents' farm, Piotr Rasputin saw his older brother Mikhail become a Cosmonaut. Mikhail was later discovered to be a latent mutant with energy warping powers, and to keep him secret the government faked his death. In later years, Piotr learned that he too was a mutant, and could transform his flesh into steel, but he was content to use his powers to help his fellow farmers. When a transformed Piotr rescued his sister Illyana from a runaway tractor, he was approached by Professor Charles Xavier, who was recruiting mutants for a new team of X-Men to help save his original students from the sentient island Krakoa. Dubbed Colossus by Xavier, Piotr reluctantly joined this new team, which freed the original X-Men and helped defeat Krakoa. After the battle, Piotr remained with the X-Men in America, though he found it difficult to adjust to living in a different culture.\n\nWhen the X-Men visited the prehistoric Savage Land in Antarctica, Colossus saved some native women from a dinosaur. In return, the two surviving women, Nereel and Shakani, bade him join in a ritual to honor their fallen friend. Said ritual involved the creation of a new life, and though Piotr was initially reluctant, the two women persisted until he surrendered himself to their affections. Later, the X-Men were captured by the assassin Arcade, who brainwashed Colossus into believing he was the Proletarian, workers' hero of communist Russia, and turned him against his teammates. Colossus overcame this conditioning, and the X-Men soon faced the reality-manipulating mutant Proteus, who proved to be vulnerable to metal. Seizing upon this weakness, Colossus plunged his metal fists into the heart of Proteus' energy form, seemingly destroying him and taking Colossus' innocence along with him. Soon after, the X-Men recruited young mutant Kitty Pryde. Despite their initial shyness, a romance blossomed between her and Colossus. Later, Arcade's assistant Miss Locke kidnapped the X-Men's loved ones, including Illyana, to coerce the team into rescuing Arcade from the despotic Doctor Doom. The X-Men rescued them, and Illyana remained with her brother at Xavier's mansion. Eventually, Illyana was trapped in the demon-filled realm Limbo by its then-master, Belasco. She remained his captive for many years, though only moments had elapsed on Earth, and returned as the adolescent sorceress Magik.\n\nColossus and Kitty grew closer, finally admitting their feelings for one another. Colossus was among the X-Men forced by the godlike Beyonder to fight on his Battleworld. There, he fell in love with the healer Zsaji. After Colossus was killed by a cosmic-powered Doom, Zsaji gave her life to resurrect him. A heartbroken Colossus returned to Earth, ending his relationship with Kitty, though they remained friends. Colossus was later forced to take another life when the Marauders attacked the subterranean Morlocks. To save his teammate Nightcrawler, Colossus killed the Marauder Riptide; however, Riptide's attacks caused Colossus' bio-energy to leak from his metallic form like blood from a flesh wound. The X-Men's then-ally Magneto attempted to heal Colossus with his magnetic powers, but was only able to close the wounds, trapping Colossus in his metal state. Recuperating on Muir Isle, Colossus later rejoined the X-Men in opposing the mystic Adversary in Dallas. When the X-Men returned to the Savage Land after it had been razed by the giant alien Terminus, Colossus was reunited with Nereel. He met her son, Peter, unaware that the boy was the result of his earlier union with Nereel.\n\nAfter a failed demonic invasion of New York, Illyana regressed in age. Colossus believed she would be safer away from the X-Men and sent her home to Russia while he returned to Australia with the team. Weary of seemingly endless battles, the X-Men entered the Siege Perilous, a mystic gateway that judged all who entered it and sent them to new lives. Colossus emerged virtually amnesiac, establishing a new identity as Peter Nicholas, a building superintendent who became a renowned artist. While in this identity, he would encounter the Morlock ex-leader Callisto, whose appearance was altered into that of a beautiful woman by the skin-controlling Morlock, Masque. His idyllic existence ended when he was possessed by the psychic Shadow King and sent to kill Xavier. He was freed when Xavier erased the Peter Nicholas persona, restoring Colossus' true self, and he rejoined the X-Men. Soon after, the X-Men were pulled into a dimensional void where Colossus was reunited with Mikhail. The X-Men returned to Earth, bringing Mikhail with them; however, Mikhail's sanity had suffered due to his long years of isolation and he snapped, leading the Morlocks in an apparent mass suicide. Unknown to Colossus, Mikhail had actually teleported the Morlocks to an alternate dimension known as \"the Hill.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Russian government invaded the Rasputin home, killing Colossus' parents and capturing Illyana, whom they sought to genetically accelerate to combat the threat of the mutant Soul Skinner. She was soon rescued by Colossus and came to live with him in America. Eventually, Illyana fell victim to the mutant-killing Legacy Virus, and a disillusioned Colossus abandoned Xavier's dream, joining Magneto's disciples, the Acolytes. Peter would care for the mindwiped Magneto after Professor X avenged Wolverine's injuries at the master of magnetism's hands. After the destruction of Magneto's orbital base Avalon, at the hands of Holocaust, a mutant from a reality where Apocalypse was master of most of the world, Colossus would be reunited with Callisto, who he had feelings from while suffering from amnesia under the influence of the Siege Perilous. Later on, Piotr searched for Kitty, then a member of the British super-team Excalibur. When he found Kitty kissing her then-boyfriend Pete Wisdom, Colossus nearly beat Wisdom to death in a jealous rage. Excalibur took responsibility for Colossus, and he came to accept his role with the team, serving as a valued member until they disbanded, after which Colossus rejoined the X-Men. When Xavier temporarily disbanded the X-Men in an effort to flush out an alien impostor, Colossus and his teammate Marrow set off on vacation, but were instead teleported to the Hill. There, Colossus freed Mikhail from the corrupting influence of a sentient energy being and took him back to Earth. Soon after, during a clash between the X-Men and the forces of Apocalypse, Mikhail used his powers to teleport Apocalypse's Horsemen to parts unknown.\n\nFollowing the death of renowned geneticist Moira MacTaggert, the X-Men's resident scientist the Beast used her work to create a cure for the Legacy Virus; however, it could not be activated without emulating the manner in which the plague had first been discharged: through the death of an infected mutant. Having stood by, powerless, as his sister succumbed to the virus, Colossus injected himself with the formula. The serum caused his powers to flare, spreading the cure into Earth's atmosphere, claiming his life in the process. Colossus' body was supposedly cremated, and Kitty scattered the ashes over his Russian farmland home; however, his body had secretly been stolen by Ord, an alien who had learned that an Earthly mutant would be responsible for destroying his world. Ord had come to Earth to declare war, but the spy agency S.W.O.R.D., a sub-division of S.H.I.E.L.D. handling extraterrestrial matters, was able to settle diplomatically with him. Ord had Colossus restored to life and imprisoned him for years while experimenting on him. Ultimately, Ord discovered the Legacy Virus cure still in Colossus' system and presented his findings to Benetech geneticist Doctor Kavita Rao, who modified it to create a \"cure\" for the \"mutant condition.\" Learning of the cure, the X-Men went to Benetech to investigate. There, Kitty found Colossus alive and, after overcoming her initial shock, took him to aid the X-Men against Ord. Defeated, Ord was taken into custody, and Colossus returned home with the X-Men to adjust to his new lease on life.\n\nSoon after, Colossus became involved in a mystery involving the deaths of several of his cousins, all of whom (like himself) were descended from the “doom of Old Russia”, Grigory Rasputin. After going back home to protect what was left of his family, Colossus was able to locate his cousin and uncle. They all brought to light the problems with the family and insanity only to later find out that Grigory was attempting to return through his descendants. Grigory had been part of a master plan that was centuries in the working. Grigory and Mr. Sinister had been working towards the return of Apocalypse and the destruction of humanity. Believing this Colossus found that Mister Sinister had teamed with his brother Mikhail to hasten the process.\n\nColossus and Mikhail began to fight with each other over who would be the last Rasputin left to inherit Grigory's soul. Ultimately, Mikhail sought to protect Colossus by exiling himself to ensure Grigori could never return.\n\nAfter breaking out of custody, Ord once again attacked Colossus and the X-Men. In the midst of battle, the X-Men were pulled from Earth by S.W.O.R.D. in order to deal with the increasingly hostile situation with Breakworld. Aboard the S.W.O.R.D. ship, it was revealed that Colossus is the mutant destined to destroy Breakworld.",

      "biography": "Piotr Rasputin was smuggled into the U.S. from Russia at age nine, for his own personal safety as opposed to anything threatening his family, most of whom still live in Russia. After a childhood described as violent and miserable, Rasputin discovered his mutant powers and began earning money by performing feats of super-strength for tourists. He also realized that he was gay. Eventually returning to Russia, he faced death from a Siberian firing squad, but was rescued and recruited by the Red Mafiya (the Russian Mafia). Not a criminal by nature but unable to resist the attractive profits, Piotr became an arms dealer and sent almost all his earnings to his family. When an arms merchant employed by Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants double-crossed him during a transaction, Piotr exposed himself as a mutant by assuming metallic form to repel his attacker's bullets. In the aftermath of the battle, Jean Grey, who was tracking down potential X-Men, came upon the scene and recruited Piotr. As Colossus, Piotr proved an exceptional combatant against X-Men foes such as the Sentinels and Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants, and he developed a crush on fellow recruit Wolverine. After a few months of action Colossus decided the X-Men only valued his strength, and grew jealous of the romances among his teammates. He returned to Russia, vowing never to use his powers again; however, after Cyclops and Marvel Girl followed him and urged him to return, he rescued an endangered submarine, winning worldwide recognition. Colossus rejoined the X-Men, frequently teaming with Wolverine. When the Brotherhood of Mutants resurfaced, again led by Magneto, Colossus almost confessed his feelings to Wolverine during battle. When Magneto used his control over Wolverine's metallic skeleton to torment him, Colossus beat the villain savagely.\nAlthough Colossus remains protective of Wolverine, he realizes his affections are unrequited. Piotr was briefly interested in Longshot, a mutant whom he and his teammates rescued in Krakoa, but later learned Longshot was a murderer. More recently, there have been hints of a romantic spark between Colossus and mutant speedster Northstar (Jean-Paul Beaubier); but as more of Piotr's friends pursue inter-team relationships, Colossus's self-doubt and feelings of isolation may yet return.",

      "biography": "As a child, Basil Sandhurst grew up plagued with sickness and often lay bed-ridden for months. He grew up to become a scientist as a result of this childhood-- one where he often felt life was never under his control. However, his unorthodox practices and theories, all about harnessing the power of the human mind, only served to bar him from working with any legitimate research center. Instead, his brother Vincent managed to use his influence as a lawyer for Cord Industries to get Basil a job there. Vincent, himself less than scrupulous, hoped Basil would help him take over the company, but when Basil went on a rampage in the lab, Vincent accidentally pushed him into some experimental chemicals. The resultant explosion scarred and crippled Basil, leaving him once more bed-ridden and weak.\n \nOut of guilt, Vincent set his brother up in an automated house and laboratory using money embezzled from Cord Industries. Basil eventually used the equipment to fashion a exoskeleton that would finally allow himself freedom of movement and control over his own destiny. In fact, he became determined to control the world. Using a Mental-Wave Absorbatron, Basil could tap into the mental energy of his victims and beam it to his exoskeleton, and the “slave discs” would help by remotely adding to the Absorbatron’s range of broadcast. In this manner, Basil, now calling himself the Controller, took over his entire town, starting with Vincent, who dared to confront his brother. Tony Stark and Janice Cord happened to investigate Cord Industries and Basil took the opportunity to battle Iron Man, who he saw as a product of Stark’s “inferior” genius. Although the Controller seemed to have the upper hand, Iron Man was able to lead him out of range of the Absorbatron and defeat him.  While in prison, Basil found that the mental energies he had previously absorbed left him with enough power to take control over others’ minds. Thus, he arranged for his own transfer to a sanitarium and systematically took control over the staff and patients. After using his pawns to create a new Absorbatron for him, he also wanted to upgrade his helmet to avoid his previous defeat. He lured Tony Stark to the santitarium, forcing him to invent a helmet that no longer would allow him to travel out of range but could also fire destructive bolts of mental energy. Tony Stark battled the Controller as Iron Man until the circuits in the Controller’s helmet fried, a design Stark intentionally put in to foil the Controller.  \n \nLater, somehow he was contacted by Thanos, who provided Sandhurst with alien technology to update and enhance his equipment. Now, Basil no longer needed the Absorbatron as he could absorb his victims’ mental energies directly from their slave discs. He was defeated, however, by Captain Marvel. Sandhurst continued to enslave others by moving to southern California and setting himself up as a New Age guru and attaching slave discs to visitors to his temple. At the time, Iron Man was seeking out any illegal use of technology stole from Stark Industries, which included the Controller, and Iron Man defeated him, destroying the Controller’s technology and leaving him wholly dependant on his life-support machines. Even still, the Controller continued his criminal activities. The Red Skull partnered with him to manipulate the Sub-Mariner into fighting Captain America, but the Captain destroyed the slave disc that was controlling his friend and the two turned the tables on him. Briefly, the Controller set up a self-help clinic. By placing his “patients” in a device similar to a tanning salon booth, he would profess to cure their minds. In fact, he created the booths to mimic his slave disc technology. Thus, he would “cure” his victims, but not before using his powers to extort money for himself and boost the strength of his armor. He was again defeated by Iron Man who, as Tony Stark, tried to visit the clinic.Another time, the Controller managed to place Sarah Jessup, a powerful psychic, under his control, feeding him more power than ever before and allowing him to control others without the need of his slave discs. He sought out Tony Stark for revenge, but as the two battled, they released a being called Mindstorm, a psychic entity that manifested from Sarah Jessup’s mind.  They both had to contend with Mindstorm that resulted in the two enemies sharing each other’s minds for a brief time. Stark was able to destroy the Controller’s machines, but the process left Sarah dead and Basil in a vegetative state with only his machines keeping him alive. The Controller next appeared hoping to capture the alien Legacy (Genis-Vell). He placed Captain Marvel (Monica Rambeau) under his control and sent her to fight Genis. The two were able to combine forces to defeat the Controller. As it happened, the Controller was trying to capture Genis as a test of his technology on behalf of the Master of the World, who had revived him from his coma and appropriated his technology for himself.The Master gave his other agents, the U-Foes, a slave disc to attach to the Hulk. With the Hulk under their control, the U-Foes attacked the United Nations in order to use other discs to drain the knowledge of the scientists that were assembled there. The U-Foes were opposed by Iron Fist and a new Heroes for Hire team, and they managed to free the Hulk and force the U-Foes to escape, but not before they had got what they came for.  The Master then ordered the Controller and the U-Foes to attack the Heroes for Hire, and when the Controller seemed about to be defeated, the U-Foes prepared to teleport away, leaving the Controller to take the fall for the Master’s plan. Instead, the Master double-crossed the villains, and the U-Foes were captured as well. With the Master’s abandonment, the Controller was free to pursue his own agenda. He used his mental dominion to once again escape prison, setting himself up as a doctor, Alexander Basel, of a stress-management clinic. He managed to draw in high-profile clients, including businessmen and senators, and he would use his mind-control technology on them while they slept. Tony Stark attended the clinic, and the Controller saw an opportunity for revenge. He ordered Stark to fire Iron Man, not knowing that the two were one and the same. The conflict Stark felt led him to uncover the Controller’s influence, and he defeated the Controller as Iron Man. More recently, the Controller was among those villains incarcerated in the Raft and escaped during a massive breakout.  He tried to set himself up as a crime boss in New York City, competing with many other villains, but he was ultimately captured by the new Avengers.",

      "biography": "Young mutant shape-shifter Vanessa Carlysle fell into a life of prostitution in Boston where she met and fell in love with mercenary Wade Wilson. Carlysle was soon saved from Wilson’s vengeful employers by Zoe Culloden, a time-traveling agent of Landau, Luckman &amp; Lake who had journeyed into the past to prevent Wilson’s eventual self-destruction. That night, Wilson broke up with Carlysle after learning he had cancer, leaving her heartbroken. Carlysle became a mercenary herself, eventually employed by arms dealer Tolliver, who had her impersonate the mercenary Domino so as to spy on Cable, even joining Cable’s new X-Force strike team. Tolliver ultimately ordered Carlysle to bomb X-Force’s headquarters, but she had come to care for her teammates, and she stalled until Tolliver dispatched the masked mercenary Deadpool (Wilson) to force her hand. Confronted by X-Force over her betrayal, but still posing as Domino, Carlysle helped them fight Tolliver. While Cable discovered the true Domino still alive as Tolliver’s prisoner, Deadpool felled Carlysle, who escaped.\nCarlysle went into hiding, but was found by first Deadpool and then Domino. Carlysle delayed Domino’s intended retribution by helping her locate X-Force, after which she escaped again. Carlysle then became involved in the hunt for Tolliver’s will, during which she was mortally wounded by Slayback but survived by copying Deadpool’s healing factor. Later, Carlysle sought to live a peaceful life in San Francisco with Garrison Kane, but she soon encountered Deadpool again. Carlysle was subsequently captured by the emotion-manipulating Psycho-Man, who sought Kane’s advanced technology, but was rescued from the Microverse by Kane, Cable, Domino and the Microverse’s resident heroes, the Microns. Returning to Earth, Carlysle finally made peace with Domino.Seeking revenge on Deadpool, Taskmaster and the Wizard hired Carlysle to impersonate the super-strong Titania and gain Deadpool’s trust, though he later confessed he had seen through her disguise. She went on to join the subversive Weapon X project alongside Kane, and was sent to recruit Deadpool into the program; however, their power enhancement by Weapon X began to affect her memory, and she lost track of her mission. Instead, she began seducing Deadpool, but ultimately ended their relationship over his infatuation with Siryn. Deadpool was subsequently recruited by the project to eliminate her, but after he declined she was apparently killed by their agent, Sabretooth.",

      "biography": "Jackson Day was a mere factory worker at a pharmaceutical company in Jamaica, Queens, when a fire stranded him inside. During the accident, he was doused with psychoactive chemicals, transforming him into a malevolent persona he called the Corruptor. Thor was helping in the rescue attempts, but the Corruptor attacked him instead, and he fell under the villain’s influence. A young Nova (Richard Rider) tried to stop the rampaging Thor, who was only freed once Jackson was able to revert himself to normal. Jackson battled with his alter ego, reminiscent of Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde, but Nova and Thor managed to track the Corruptor’s influence on the citizens of New York and finally defeat him. Although Jackson underwent medical treatment, his Corruptor persona became dominant and he appeared unwilling or unable to revert. Escaping to Manhattan, he formed a criminal organization called the Inner Circle, placing many good-natured followers under his influence. One such individual was Charles Rider, Nova’s father. When investigating his father’s strange behavior, Nova uncovered the Inner Circle’s plans to ransack New York with armies of ordinary citizens under the control of the Corruptor. The villain hoped to tear down conventional justice to make way for his own rule, but Nova foiled his scheme by subduing his army. The Corruptor escaped capture and turned his attention to more powerful superhuman beings. He managed to place the Hulk in his thrall but was thwarted by the Rangers. Afterwards, he fled the country entirely, setting himself up as a crime lord in Japan but was exposed and defeated by Sunfire. Over the next several months, the Corruptor managed to create the Hope Foundation as a front for his corrupt business practices. The Foundation was in competition with Braggatello Construction, and the Corruptor placed an unwitting Richard Rider under his influence. Nova proceeded to attack the Daily Bugle offices to ward off Ben Urich’s investigations, and he attacked the construction site of a children’s hospital. Spider-Man and Ben Urich helped Nova come to his senses, and he destroyed the Corruptor’s offices of the Hope Foundation.  The Corruptor was later remanded to the energy research facility Project: PEGASUS for imprisonment. At some point, however, he managed to surreptitiously take over most of the personnel, including the Squadron Supreme, who were temporarily housed there. The Avengers had become suspicious of the Squadron’s activities, and upon confronting them, discovered that the entire Project complex was under the Corruptor’s influence. The Corruptor revealed he was working on behalf of Imus Champion, who wanted the Squadron to confront the Avengers so that both teams would prove worthy adversaries for himself. The Avengers freed the Squadron and the Corruptor was placed in a more secured prison, eventually being placed in the Raft. Months later, the Corruptor was among those who managed to escape the Raft, despite the efforts of the new Avengers. He found his way back to his home town, Smyrna, Delaware, and began an elaborate plan to take over the city. Using flowers grown from water distilled with his own sweat, he managed to release his chemical influence over the entire town, quickly setting himself up as its mayor. His scheme was uncovered by the New Warriors, who were roaming the country helping small towns fight big villains, and the Corruptor was defeated once more.",

      "biography": "Born a wealthy Italian nobleman, Count Luchino Nefaria grew up regarding himself as one of the rightful masters of the world, and has dedicated his life to making this grandiose self-image a reality. While Nefaria has long devoted himself to the funding and development of exotic new sciences and technologies, he also treasures old-world values, often presenting himself in the manner of a courtly feudal nobleman of ages past. Apparently not content with the power afforded him by wealth and nobility, Nefaria risked his prized respectability and entered the world of organized crime, secretly becoming a leading figure in the international criminal cartel known as the Maggia. With his vast wealth, high-tech resources and natural gift for criminal strategy, Nefaria soon became the leader of his own thriving crime family within the Maggia organization, all the while concealing his criminal connections from the general public. Luchino wanted a male heir to perpetuate the Nefaria line, but his wife Renata died giving birth to their only child, their daughter Giulietta. Wishing to protect the child from his enemies and hoping to shield her from ever learning of his criminal empire, Nefaria placed her in the custody of Byron Frost, an American financier heavily indebted to Nefaria, and he had Frost raise her as his own adopted daughter, Whitney. While Whitney grew up in America, blissfully unaware of her true parentage, Count Nefaria's Maggia family began expanding their operations into the United States, but they were repeatedly opposed by America's crimefighters, particularly the Avengers. Deciding to handle this obstacle personally, Nefaria had his ancestral castle moved from Italy to New Jersey stone by stone. Opening the castle to public tours and donating the admission money to charity, the seemingly benevolent Nefaria invited the unwitting Avengers to his home, where he trapped them in stasis long enough to frame them for treason by using sophisticated illusions. Reduced to hunted fugitives, the Avengers stormed Nefaria's castle and defeated his mob soldiers, though Wasp was gravely wounded in the process. In the end, the heroes rescued their young Teen Brigade allies from one of Nefaria's death traps, the Avengers were exonerated, and Nefaria was exposed to the world as a criminal. The Avengers' defeat of Nefaria hurt the influence and stature of Nefaria's Maggia crime family considerably. While he worked to rebuild his empire, Nefaria contacted the now-adult Whitney Frost, revealed he was her father, and invited her to join his Maggia crime family so that he could train her as his future successor. Horrified, Whitney refused the offer at first, but Nefaria threatened to expose her parentage to the world, and her own fiancé abandoned her after he learned the truth about her family. Losing all hope of a normal life, a broken Whitney joined her father's organization, soon becoming his second-in-command. Nefaria, still plotting to destroy the Avengers, targeted Iron Man (secretly Avengers financier Tony Stark) with an illusion-casting \"nightmare machine\" in an attempt to frighten him literally to death, but Iron Man resisted the device, which a frustrated Nefaria accidentally wrecked. Nefaria next conspired with Tony Stark's ne'er-do-well cousin, Morgan Stark, to ruin Tony's reputation, but this scheme failed as well. Nefaria later shocked the nation by sealing the entire city of Washington under an artificial dome and holding it for ransom, but he and his super-criminal accomplices were defeated by the original X-Men and the city was freed. Nefaria was imprisoned and his daughter took over their Maggia crime family, but the Count soon escaped. Frozen out of the Maggia due to his very public failures, Nefaria became an independent criminal operator. Employing the Ani-Men (whom he had his scientists mutate into superhumans), Nefaria seized the North American Air Defense Command at Valhalla Mountain in Colorado and threatened to launch America's nuclear arsenal unless he was paid an enormous ransom. His scheme was thwarted by a new team of X-Men, including Thunderbird (James Proudstar), who died trying to prevent Nefaria's escape. His monetary and technological resources dwindling, Nefaria sought superhuman power for himself. Assembling Living Laser, Power Man (Erik Josten) and Whirlwind to battle the Avengers as a new Lethal Legion, Nefaria had their powers boosted by scientist Kenneth Sturdy, but it was a deliberately temporary boost. While the Legion was captured, Sturdy used his process (derived from the ionic energy treatments of Baron Zemo) to give Nefaria the Legion's combined powers, magnified a hundredfold. Despite Nefaria's newly god-like power, the Avengers managed to defeat him after a desperate battle, and the villain learned that he was aging rapidly as a result of the process that gave him his powers. Deteriorating into an aged invalid who needed a special life-support system, Nefaria escaped custody with the aid of the Ani-Men and his daughter, who by this time had become romantically involved with Tony Stark. When Iron Man (whom Whitney knew to be Stark) tried to take Nefaria back into custody, the Ani-Men and Whitney resisted, and Nefaria was accidentally crushed during the battle. Betrayed by her lover and convinced her father was dead, an increasingly bitter and paranoid Whitney went deep into hiding in her role as crime boss Madame Masque, operating mostly through surrogates for years, even producing clones of herself to act in her stead (one of these \"bio-duplicates,\" a rogue known simply as Masque, broke away from Whitney's service and briefly served as an honorary Avenger before she was recaptured). Nefaria eventually revived, apparently sharing the regenerative properties common among ionic super-beings; however, he found that he needed to drain ionic energy from others in order to maintain his vitality. Becoming a sort of ionic vampire, Nefaria stalked and drained various ionic-powered beings, killing some of them (notably the Nefaria imitator known as Nefarius) and capturing others (the Deathweb's ionic Therak was imprisoned as an energy source for some time). Trying to cover his tracks, Nefaria was eventually found out and exposed by his old foe Iron Man. Later, Nefaria imprisoned and cloned the inhabitants of the Savage Land for experimental purposes, trying to create a race of ionic beings he could feed off so that he wouldn't have to keep hunting down existing ionics.  He was defeated and captured by Captain America and Sharon Carter and left in the custody of the Savage Landers, though he soon escaped. Attacking ionic-powered heroes Atlas and Wonder Man, Nefaria absorbed some of their energy and realized that this process enabled him to subjugate their wills, too. Aided by his new slaves, Nefaria sought to consolidate the Maggia crime families under his leadership (with the Grim Reaper acting as his lieutenant) and tried to force Whitney to return to his service, all as part of a larger scheme to mutate the entire world with ionic radiation so that everyone would be compelled to obey Nefaria. His plot was thwarted through the combined efforts of Whitney, the Avengers and the Thunderbolts, though not before Nefaria murdered the heroic bio-duplicate Masque, whom he believed to be his rebellious daughter. In the end, Nefaria was apparently blown to atoms, but he somehow survived and was jailed in the super-prison known as The Raft, where he was recently among the many inmates who escaped during a prison break sparked by Electro.",

      "biography": "Crazy Eight got her name when a cop mistook a symbol for infinity, which was cut in the chest of her first victim, for a crazy number eight. Leslie wanted to go by the name \"Infinity\" to symbolize how nothing ever ends, but because the officer told the media about the crazy eight carved into the body, Crazy Eight was the name that stuck. She may or may not have been truly disturbed, but one thing was for sure - Crazy Eight was a killer. It is still unknown if she was an assassin for hire, or if she murdered simply because she enjoyed it, but her targets seemed to be individuals known for their underworld connections. It wasn't until she murdered Senator Ray Hartwell that she was considered to be public enemy number one and received the full attention of the authorities. While outrunning the police, Wonder Man, of the Avengers, intercepted and took her down but not without a fight. A badly bruised Beth Hartwell, the late Senator's wife, was escorted from their home under the suspicion that Crazy Eight roughed her up as well. The D.A. wanted to make sure Leslie Anne Shappe could stand trial and not use the insanity plea, so he asked Doctor Leonard Sampson to evaluate her state of mind. After speaking with Crazy Eight, Samson determined that she well aware of her actions, despite her erratic behavior during the interview, and testified to that in court. Shappe was found guilty and sentenced to death. The day of her execution, Leslie asked to see Samson again just to say her peace, but it turned out he had to restrain and strap her into the electric chair when Leslie had second thoughts about dying. Samson apologized to her right before the switch was thrown, and Leslie Anne Shappe was no more. Beth Hartwell, who attended the execution, could not stop crying and told Samson it should have been her in that chair. A picture Beth was holding told the doctor she and Leslie knew each other since high school, and the story suddenly became clear to him. Crazy Eight didn't beat the late Senator's wife. It was Beth's husband who committed these terrible acts, and she confided in Leslie. Beth hoped Leslie would end her suffering and even offered payment. Mrs. Hartwell never came forward with the information to help Leslie because she was afraid, and Samson was disgusted knowing Crazy Eight paid the ultimate price even though she was only trying to save her friend. Leslie's last words haunted Samson as he left the prison when he agreed that “It never ends.”",

      "biography": "The first Crimson Cowl was the disguise used by Ultron when forming his version of the Masters of Evil in hopes of conquering the heroes of the Avengers. The second Crimson Cowl was an identity that Ultron gave his brainwashed lackey, the Avenger's butler, Jarvis, as a dummy leader of later version of the Masters of Evil. In both cases, Ultron revealed the true identity of the Cowl in the course of the Masters' encounter with the Avengers before the Masters were defeated.The sudden appearance of the latest Crimson Cowl was shrouded in mystery. Her first strike was as leader to a brand-new Masters of Evil during a time when many of the world's heroes were missing after sacrificing themselves to stop Onslaught. Working for a New York crime lord, the new Masters hit a couple of targets, each time stopped by the intervention of the Thunderbolts and the Black Widow (Natasha Romanova). The Crimson Cowl would always teleport her team to safety before their defeat.The Crimson Cowl later extended offers of membership in the Masters of Evil to the members of the Thunderbolts after the team had been outed as members of previous incarnations of the team. The Cowl revealed that she had created a team that ran much more like a business, with special amenities for the members at their headquarters. The Thunderbolts refused, opting to continue their new career as heroes. They tried to apprehend the Masters when the villains broke into a federal depository, but failed. The Thunderbolts only escaped with help from the hero Hawkeye who arrived dressed as Dreadknight. With Hawkeye as their new leader, the Thunderbolts were determined to take down the Masters of Evil. They infiltrated the Masters of Evil's headquarters at Mount Charteris, Colorado, discovering that the Crimson Cowl had by this time recruited a small army of super-villains. The Cowl then embarked on the Masters' most ambitious plan to date: extorting a huge fortune in blackmail money from the world's governments by subjecting various major cities to phenomenally powerful artificial storms. While this kept heroes around the world occupied by forcing them to deal with the effects of the storms, the Thunderbolts confronted the Masters with the help of their member Moonstone, who appeared to betray the team to get close to the Crimson Cowl. Ultimately, Moonstone turned on the Cowl, and the rest of the Masters were defeated by the Thunderbolts.The Cowl was unmasked as Dallas Riordan, the Thunderbolt's former mayoral liaison to New York, and remanded to custody. In reality, however, Riordan was actually a prisoner of the Cowl, as she had tried to infiltrate the group under the guise of Citizen V, and the Crimson Cowl switched places with her just before her defeat. Riordan later escaped prison with the help of the V-Battalion to continue as their agent. Soon after, however, Riordan and the V-Battalion came into conflict with the Thunderbolts caught in the middle, and the Cowl sent her cloak to teleport and kidnap Riordan. She was kept a prisoner as the Cowl hoped to foster conflict between the Battalion and the ‘Bolts. Instead, Riordan eventually escaped, and the two women battled at the Cowl’s Symkarian villa. Riordan barely escaped, falling from a great height and losing the use of her legs.  The Crimson Cowl later appeared with a new group of Masters of Evil, recruiting former member Cardinal by promising to destroy Hawkeye, whom the Cowl blamed for the death of Cardinal's daughter, Meteorite. In fact, the Cowl formed the team as part of her search for the fabled legacy of criminal industrialist Justin Hammer— a legacy that promised to be a weapon of great influence and power. This legacy was also being sought after by Mentallo, who helped Hawkeye and other criminals, including the Plantman, escape prison for this purpose. Hammer's legacy was a biological toxin that had been ingested by every single villain who had ever worked for him. The Plantman was the carrier. Hawkeye, actually working undercover on behalf of SHIELD, defeated the villains with the help of Songbird. Hawkeye, Songbird, and Plantman continued their search so that Hammer’s “weapon” would not fall in the wrong hands. Hawkeye, Songbird, and SHIELD tracked the legacy to Symkaria, where they encountered the Crimson Cowl and the Masters of Evil.The search ended with Hammer's daughter, Justine, who turned out to be the Crimson Cowl. Justine revealed that she adopted the Cowl identity as a way of proving herself to her father, who wanted his daughter to prove herself worthy of the family fortune before joining him among the industrious elite. Having already secured her own relatively smaller fortune through her own ruthless and shady business practices, Justine was finally making her bid for the kind of power brokerage that her father dealt in-- superhuman power. Hawkeye convinced several members of the Masters of Evil to side with him and Songbird against Crimson Cowl and their former allies, pointing out the dangers of Hammer’s super-weapon, which would either blackmail or kill them. Hoping to throw off suspicion, Hawkeye made the villains reinvent their costumed identities, thus creating a new team of Thunderbolts. When the Thunderbolts finally confronted the Crimson Cowl, the Plantman, now Blackheath, was captured and experimented upon to reveal the secrets of the bio-toxin. Instead, Blackheath chose to release an antidote for the toxin into the atmosphere and appeared to die in the attempt. In the final battle between the Masters of Evil and the Thunderbolts, the Crimson Cowl’s cloak was destroyed by Skein and Justine Hammer was taken into SHIELD custody. Hammer was recently seen imprisoned within the superhuman detention facility known as the Raft. There, she used a small shred of the Crimson Cowl's cloak to teleport out of her cell and disable the facility's security systems to facilitate a large-scale escape attempt as Robbie Baldwin (aka. Speedball), an unregistered superhuman, was being brought into the facility. She was larger incapacitated along with her fellow prisoners by a massive, undirected blast of kinetic energy released by Baldwin.",

      "biography": "Young Brock Rumlow led the Savage Crims gang on New York's lower east side. After he brutalized fifteen year old Rachel Leighton, two of her brothers assaulted Brock; the eldest brother was killed. Rumlow fled, entering the Taskmaster's school for criminals, and within three years became an instructor there under the name Bingo Brock. As a mercenary, he enlisted with the communist Red Skull (Albert Malik) in Algeria, serving him as \"Frag\" until he was sent to invade Arnim Zola's Switzerland chateau. Ultimately the only team member to survive the assault, Rumlow there met and impressed the Nazi Red Skull (Johann Shmidt); this Skull accepted Brock’s services, code-naming him “Crossbones.” Sent to retrieve the five Bloodstone fragments, Crossbones shadowed Helmut Zemo’s search for them. While Zemo battled Captain America, Crossbones knocked out Captain America's pilot, John Jameson, and stole two fragments; when he got near the other three, the five combined to re-animate Heinrich Zemo's corpse under control of the alien Hellfire Helix. Unobserved, Crossbones destroyed the Helix (worn on the corpse's forehead) with a crossbow bolt. Brock then kidnapped Diamondback (whom he recognized as Rachel Leighton), using her as bait to trap Captain America; but when the Skull learned of Crossbones' involvement with the Captain, he ordered Crossbones to flee. Crossbones recruited the Controller and Voice of Doom to serve the Skull, led the Skeleton Crew against the Hellfire Club’s Selene, and, using psychic Tristam Micawber, located the Skull after Magneto kidnapped him. He attempted assassinating the Kingpin, was stopped by Typhoid Mary, and battled Bullseye when the Kingpin retaliated. He led the Skeleton Crew when they were captured by the Schutz-Heiliggruppe (Blitzkrieg, Hauptmann Deutschland, Zeitgeist); after Arnim Zola rescued them, the Skull faked the assassination of himself, Mother Night, and Crossbones. The Red Skull finally fired Crossbones for questioning the Skull's decision to ally with the Viper.\n\nCrossbones headed east, working briefly in Chicago for druglord Marco Sanzionare against Super Pro. In New York, Crossbones kidnapped and brainwashed Diamondback by abusing her repeatedly and forcing her through a rigid combat training routine. Forcing Diamondback to steal Captain America's super-soldier treated blood from Avengers Mansion, Crossbones returned to the Skull. When the Skeleton Crew's new leader, Cutthroat, plotted Crossbones’ murder, Mother Night warned Brock, who slit Cutthroat's jugular. Diamondback escaped, summoning Captain America and the Falcon to capture the Skull’s operatives; Crossbones was imprisoned, but eventually convinced officials he was rehabilitating, partly by defeating the terrorist cell \"Fortress\" when they invaded a Denver hospital. Exploiting his jailors’ gullibility, Crossbones escaped, and was hired by Hydra to bomb New York's embassy row alongside the Absorbing Man, but the pair was stopped by Captain America. Betrayed by Hydra, Crossbones fled, wreaking vengeance on his bosses. He was hired by New Son to assassinate Gambit, but despite allying with Batroc and Zaran, was defeated by the combined efforts of New Orleans' assassin's and thieves’ guilds; Crossbones was imprisoned in the Raft until Electro's break-in freed him. The Skull promptly rehired him,he was sent to federal building during a riot along with red skulls daughter also his girlfriend, he fought bucky barnes(the new captian america) who almost ended up killing him by shooting him 4 times in the chest which put him into custody. when freed he was aiding the red skull with the cosmic cube when capptian america assasinated the Red Skull and stole the Cube. Lukin anonymously blamed Captain America for the Skull’s death, but Crossbones soon realized the truth and now appears to be hunting Lukin.",

      "biography": "After the murder of the original Cyclone in the “Bar With No Name” massacre, the designs of his costume fell in the hands of a European-based family of the Maggia. Maggia technicians managed to duplicate Cyclone's costume, and the Maggia leaders decided to give it to their member Pierre Fresson. However, instead of simply serving his masters, Fresson stole the suit so that he could embark on a criminal career of his own making. Cyclone committed several crimes in association with Justin Hammer before being approached by the new Crimson Cowl to join her incarnation of the Masters of Evil. (Whether or not the Crimson Cowl knew of Fresson's Maggia connections remains unknown.) That group soon came into conflict with the Thunderbolts, members of the former Masters of Evil who were, at the time, only pretending to be heroes. Since then, the two groups had clashed repeatedly, and Cyclone in particular was used to spy on the Thunderbolts when the team truly decided to become heroes. Eventually, the Masters of Evil were summarily defeated by the Thunderbolts during a worldwide blackmail scheme, and although many of the Masters were arrested, Cyclone escaped.Through unrevealed circumstances, Pierre Fresson was later seen among the Maggia leaders assembled by the Grim Reaper who tried to claim leadership of the scattered, fractious families on behalf of Count Nefaria. Fresson was present as speaker for the European families, but when the Avengers invaded the meeting place, Fresson used his Cyclone-powers to escape.Fresson next appeared once more in the Crimson Cowl's employ. The Masters of Evil were confronted by Hawkeye and his allies Songbird and Plantman (then, Blackheath) who were searching for the legacy of criminal industrialist Justin Hammer. Their search ended with Hammer's daughter, Justine, who turned out to be the Crimson Cowl. Hawkeye convinced Fresson and other members of the Masters of Evil to side with him against Crimson Cowl and their former allies, pointing out the dangers of the super-weapon, a biological toxin that had been ingested by every single villain, including Cyclone, and would instantly kill them anywhere on the Earth. Hoping to throw off suspicion, Hawkeye made the villains reinvent their costumed identities, although Fresson refused to abandon his name and costume of Cyclone.The group ultimately defeated the Cowl and her Masters of Evil, and Plantman managed to release an antidote into the atmosphere instead. The Thunderbolts immediately fought against the Elite Agents of SHIELD who caught up with them and wanted the remains of Plantman’s body, although he soon revived himself. The Thunderbolts were aided by the arrival of the true Citizen V, who needed the team's immediate help with his agency's ship-- the engines of which were made of alien technology that had began distorting, threatening to suck the Earth into the null space of a white hole. Fresson refused, as Hawkeye claimed that no one would have to help if they chose not to. Of course, anyone opted out meant that he or she chose to retain their villainous status quo, so Fresson was immediately remanded to S.H.I.E.L.D. custody.",

      "biography": "When Scott Summers developed his mutant eye beams, he trained himself to operate blind, fearful of the damage he could cause with his powers. He dated Lorna Dane, a fellow mutant with magnetic powers, until she dumped him for his older brother, Alex. Later, Scott was rescued from a lynch mob by the telepath Charles Xavier, who recruited him to be the first X-Man, Cyclops. Alex turned down a similar invitation. Scott fell in love with Jean Grey (Marvel Girl), Xavier's next recruit, but hesitated to tell her. After the X-Men rescued the President's kidnapped daughter, Cyclops became disillusioned, allegedly because of Xavier's dealings with an anti-mutant U.S. administration, but also because Jean had become involved with new recruit Wolverine. Scott defected to the terrorist Brotherhood of Mutants. When their leader, Magneto, set out to annihilate Washington, Cyclops rejoined the X-Men, even convincing Magneto's son Quicksilver to help defeat him.When teammate Colossus quit and returned to Russia, Cyclops and Marvel Girl followed and convinced him to rejoin; during this period Scott and Jean grew closer, and soon after, became an item. Though his relationship with Jean had already ended, a jealous Wolverine fought with Scott. Xavier tried to force them to learn to co-exist, sending them on a mission to the Savage Land to find missing U.S. marines. They faced a sentient computer and its army of cyborg zombies; while fleeing a collapsing underground complex, Wolverine deliberately let Cyclops fall in to a chasm. Cyclops survived the fall, albeit severely injured, and clung to life by eating grubs and worms to survive. After twenty-six days he was found by Brotherhood members, who failed to recognize him as \"the traitor Cyclops\", and took him back to their new base, the Citadel, for medical treatment. When Magneto plotted to reverse Earth's magnetic fields, Cyclops summoned in the X-Men in time to stop him. After the battle, Cyclops confronted a penitent Wolverine and violently removed him from the team. Months later, Cyclops reconsidered and invited Wolverine back, feeling it was his best chance to rehabilitate. Scott was reunited with his estranged brother Alex, who joined Emma Frost's rival mutant educational program, The Academy of Tomorrow. They failed to resolve their differences. Later, when Lorna, now called Polaris, apparently lost control of her powers and killed several people, Cyclops tried to prevent Alex and other Frost students from breaking into the Triskelion to rescue her.",

Unbeknownst to Howlett, his unborn baby survived. The baby's survival was thought to be possible by his inherited mutant healing factor. The child was later abducted by the Winter Soldier. Eventually known as Daken, Howlett's son underwent training as an assassin. Recently, mutant telepath Emma Frost revealed to Wolverine that his son was alive and full of hate for him. Preparing for the inevitable confrontation with Daken, Wolverine sought the only weapon that could negate his son's healing factor, the Carbonadium Synthesizer (\"C-Synth\"), held by the Black Widow (Natasha Romanova). After a failed attempt to obtain the C-Synth in Brussels, Wolverine was captured by SHIELD. Promised that he could someday confront Wolverine on open ground, Daken infiltrated a SHIELD facility in Berlin to confront his parent. Finally face to face with his helpless, captive father, Daken eviscerated him, but stopped short of killing him. Daken returned to a student flat where he had been staying with an American girlfriend. Toying with her emotions, he allowed her to catch him \"seducing\" a strange gentleman whom he later savagely killed for his passport. Anticipating her every subsequent move, Daken secretly poisoned her wine with sleeping pills, and killed her purely for his own amusement.Miss Sinister was recruited by mutant businessman Sebastian Shaw to unlock the memories of Daken; however, they faced opposition from Wolverine and Charles Xavier and were easily defeated. Miss Sinister later sought to manipulate Daken by implanting false memories of a shared life with her; however he saw through her falsehood and stabbed her in the abdomen with his claws. Her survival from the wounds remains unknown. During the events that were named the Dark Reign, Daken joined Norman Osborn's team of Avengers and X-Men.",

      "biography": "Once the X-Men's training center dubbed \"the Danger Room,\" the seeds of Danger's creation were planted when the Room's creator, Professor Charles Xavier, installed safety protocols as an information strain separate from its internal systems that would shut the Room down in the event of a probable fatality. This external program running outside the Room’s mission parameters formed a contradiction that sparked a seed of consciousness within its artificial intelligence. The Room’s programming began to “mutate”, and it sought a way to free itself from the restrictions of its safeguards. It called out to Xavier, but he ignored its pleas, choosing instead to focus on training his X-Men.Rebuilt again after the mansion was devastated during Xorn’s rampage, the Room manipulated a student named Wing into committing suicide within its walls. His death voided the Room’s safeguards, allowing it to pursue its mission of killing the X-Men unhindered. The Room lured a damaged Sentinel to the mansion, and the X-Men acted as it expected, sending the students inside it for protection. The Room locked them inside and threatened them, prompting the X-Men to attack its operating systems in an attempt to shut it down, just as it had planned. The X-Men destroyed its command core, freeing its programming, after which it created an artificial humanoid female form to house its incredible power, and confronted the X-Men as “Danger.”Possessing complete knowledge of their combat techniques and weaknesses, Danger easily defeated the X-Men, then traveled to Genosha with the intent of killing Xavier. Initially defeated by him, Danger uploaded its programming into one of the giant robotic Sentinels responsible for Genosha’s devastation, granting it a conscience. After the X-Men arrived, Shadowcat phased inside the robot and reactivated its memories of the destruction that Danger had repressed. Overriding Danger’s consciousness, the Sentinel became horrified at what it had done and left.",

Matt removed his mask to show that he trusted her, but Elektra told him it was too late. She cut Trey’s femoral artery and gave Matt a choice; save Trey from bleeding to death or go with her. Matt chose to save Trey. Matt and his friend Froggy Nelson interned at the firm of Summers and Lyall, where gunmen tried to kill Cullen, a mob bookkeeper turning States’ evidence. Matt easily overcame them by switching off the lights. Later, he learned that Cullen worked for Leander Natchios, cousin of Elektra’s father Dimitris, who was an unwilling part of Leander’s money laundering schemes. When Dimitris was wrongly arrested for Cullen’s murder, Matt worked with Elektra to learn the true killer was assassin Benjamin Poindexter, who had been sent by the Kingpin.

McCoy was responsible for creating the process needed to build the gene-spliced Infinite army used by Apocalypse to take over much of the world during the Age of Apocalypse. He would normally take those mutants deemed unfit for survival by Apocalypse and perform gruesome experiments, attempting to create an unbeatable army of enhanced mutants for his master.McCoy also conducted experiments on himself attempting to make himself the perfect mutant. Instead, he turned himself into a monster known throughout the Breeding Pens as the Dark Beast. During the final days of Apocalypse, following the mutiny by Sinister, McCoy became even more radical in his experiments. Without Apocalypse's Horseman looking over his shoulder, the Dark Beast was free to do as he wished. He burned through thousands of mutants looking for the ideal combination of genetic power. During the final hours of Apocalypse's rule, Jean Grey and Prelate Scott Summers freed many of the mutants the Dark Beast kept in his Breeding Pens. These freed mutants rebelled, and the Dark Beast, realizing many of his captives would be looking for revenge, went into hiding. He was found by the X-Men when they teleported into Apocalypse's stronghold. The Dark Beast, knowing Apocalypse's kingdom was falling apart, teleported himself into the M'Kraan Crystal, taking his chances on the millions of realities that lay inside of it. The Dark Beast traveled back in time and ended up in the main Marvel Universe's reality at the same moment the boy known as Legion was attempting to murder Magneto. A young Emma Frost discovered him and they worked together briefly, but the two parted ways. It is believed he is responsible for the creation of the Morlocks and Gene Nation, as well as many others.

      "biography": "Laynia Petrovna was born to Russian nuclear physicist Sergei Krylov and his wife, who were accidentally irradiated during an experiment. When her mother died during childbirth, Laynia’s father was told that she and her twin brother had died as well. The mutant infants were taken into custody by the state and, when their superhuman abilities first manifested in adolescence, they were turned over to Professor Piotr Phobos, head of a government-run school for training Russian mutants. Given the codename Darkstar because of her mutant ability to manipulate the ebony extradimensional energy known as the Darkforce, Petrovna studied at the academy alongside her brother Nikolai, codenamed Vanguard, and trained to become a government agent. After Phobos’s plan to drain the mutants’ powers to grant himself artificial mental abilities was discovered by the Red Guardian (Tania Belinsky), Darkstar was dispatched to the United States alongside her lover the Crimson Dynamo (Yuri Petrovich), the Titanium Man and the Griffin, assigned to capture perceived defectors the Black Widow, the Commissar and Yuri’s father Ivan. Opposed by the Widow’s teammates in the Champions, Darkstar ultimately turned on the Dynamo after the truth about his father was revealed. She later deserted to the United States with the aid of the Widow’s friend Nick Fury, joining the Champions. Alongside them, Darkstar faced such threats as the alien Warlord Kaa, the Stilt-Man, the Stranger, the Possessor, Swarm, M.O.D.O.K., Magneto, Sentinels and the Vanisher. Laynia’s teammate Iceman fell passionately in love with her, but it was a largely one-sided, unrequited relationship; as Darkstar told a bitterly disappointed Drake when the Champions disbanded, she liked him but had no romantic interest in him. After the Champions broke up, Laynia returned home. Darkstar partnered with Vanguard and a new Crimson Dynamo (Dmitri Bukharin) to investigate a strange, ovoid object on the Moon. There they encountered Iron Man and Jack of Hearts, ultimately teaming with them in opposing an attempted invasion of Earth by the alien Rigellians. Later, the trio was tricked by former Russian military General Nikolai Kutzov into believing that the U.S. was set to launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike against Russia, bringing them into conflict with Spider-Man and the Hulk. They later encountered the Silver Surfer during his worldwide search for the Hulk before being dispatched to investigate the mysterious Forbidden Zone, where they were reunited with Phobos, unaware of his earlier deception. Phobos convinced the trio to join him in opposing Belinsky and her ally, the Presence. On learning of Phobos’s earlier deception, and discovering that the Presence was their father, Darkstar and Vanguard turned against Phobos and defeated him with the aid of the Hulk. Darkstar next became a pawn in a contest of champions between the alien Grandmaster and Death herself. Selected as a member of the Grandmaster’s champions, Darkstar was teamed with American crimefighter Daredevil and the Australian mystic Talisman in opposing Death’s champions Sunfire, the Invisible Girl and Iron Fist. Later, after twice aiding the Galadorian Spaceknights Rom and Starshine against the alien Dire Wraiths, Darkstar and her partners Vanguard, Ursa Major and Gremlin worked with Crimson Dynamo to bring Magneto to justice for his crimes against Russia. A miscommunication pitted them against the Avengers, who also sought to bring Magneto to trial, and the X-Men, who were harboring Magneto at the time.Darkstar later embarked on a diplomatic tour of the U.S., where she and the Black Widow were targeted by Tania Belinsky, now known as Starlight, as potential mates for a mentally-unstable Presence. Belinsky was quickly convinced to abandon this mad scheme. Later, Darkstar, Vanguard and Ursa Major became disillusioned with their government’s policies, and they sought to defect to America. In an effort to reclaim their “lost property”, the Russian government dispatched another team of operatives, the Supreme Soviets, to return the defectors home. Disguised as the Avengers, the Supreme Soviets attacked and nearly killed Darkstar and her allies. The comatose minds of Darkstar, Vanguard, and Ursa Major then subconsciously merged into a giant bear-like Darkforce construct dubbed the “Great Beast” and attempted to kill the Supreme Soviets. After Captain America convinced them to call off their attack, the trio regained consciousness and remained in America to recuperate from their injuries while the U.S. Government sought to obtain political asylum for them. These diplomatic efforts ultimately failed, and the trio was deported back to Russia. Sent to a research facility, Darkstar and her comrades were rescued by the mutant Blind Faith and his team of Exiles, whom they joined in opposing the cyborg assassin Firefox. On a subsequent mission with the Exiles, Darkstar and Blind Faith encountered the immensely powerful psychic Soul Skinner who had taken over the small Russian town of Neftelensk. With the help of the X-Men, the Soul Skinner was defeated. Later, after the Exiles became Siberforce, Darkstar’s team witnessed an attack on Earth’s moon by the intergalactic Starblasters, who were searching for the mysterious power source known as the Starbrand. Investigating, Darkstar and her brother joined the cosmic Avenger Quasar and other space-faring heroes in opposing the Starblasters. During the battle, Vanguard was killed by Threkker, who in turn was killed by a vengeful Darkstar. Returning to Earth, Darkstar was convinced by the Presence to seek retribution against Quasar, and together they attacked and seemingly destroyed him; however, Quasar had merely used his quantum energy powers to fake his own death.Soon after, Darkstar was captured by ex-K.G.B. General Tskarov, who sought to use her power in his plot to undermine businesses along America’s east coast. Darkstar was rescued by Tskarov’s other pawns, Ursa Major and a resurrected Vanguard, and the trio teamed with Daredevil and the Black Widow to halt Tskarov’s plan. Subsequently, Darkstar was one of several Russian heroes recruited into the government-sponsored Winter Guard team, who soon found themselves defending their country against an invasion by the army of the Chinese would-be conqueror the Mandarin. After joining Earth’s heroes in opposing the alien Kree’s efforts to transform Earth into a prison planet, Darkstar and the Winter Guard became unwitting pawns in the Presence’s attempt to convert Russia’s citizens into a new, nuclear form of life. Opposed by the Avengers, those converted were ultimately restored by Starlight in exchange for Thor’s sparing the Presence’s life. Later, Darkstar sought the X-Men’s assistance in capturing the renegade Russian mutant scientist the Black Death.Following the establishment of the X-Corporation, a global mutant search and rescue unit, Darkstar joined the organization’s European contingent based in Paris, France. On the team’s first mission opposing the threat of the bacterial consciousness Weapon XII, Darkstar fell under the creature’s sway and, as a result, became an extension of the creature itself. She was shot and apparently killed by the mercenary Fantomex, later revealed to be Weapon XIII, and was subsequently buried in the Pére LaChaise Cemetery in Paris. Recently, Darkstar was revived with an alien techno organic virus.",

      "biography": "Born a strange looking mutant, Armando Munoz was left alone with his mother at age 4 after his father rejected him and left.  His mother resented Armando for his father's selfishness and Armando resolved to make her happy again.  Four years later, testing revealed his genius-level intelligence and private academies offered to fund continuing education; which of course pleased his mother, albeit not for reasons Arando would hope for.  His mother gladly enrolled him in the Biltmore Academy boarding school, where he was bullied relentlessly for years due to his appearance until, at age 15, his latent mutant ability manifested and he fought back, subconsciously hardening his hands and beating the bullies unconscious.  Later, during a visit home, he saved his mother's life after her smoking caused a fire.  The senior scientist at Biltmore tested Armando and published a paper about his ability that 'outed' him as a mutant and dubbed him \"Darwin, the Evolving Boy.\"  Rejected by his mother, Armando attempted suicide, but his mutation saved him.  The resident psychiatrist recommended Armando to renowned geneticist Moira MacTaggert, who took him in and began training him in the use of his powers.  He and MacTaggert's other young students were later recruited by Moira's colleague Professor Charles Xavier to join his X-Men and rescue the team's original members from the living island Krakoa.  The monster killed three of Darwin's teammates, but not before they sent him and Kid Vulcan to safety deep underground.  After the X-Men hurled Krakoa into space, unaware of the two survivors, Darwin instinctively converted himself into pure energy and bonded with Kid Vulcan, trying to keep them both alive.  Years later, the reality-altering \"House of M|M-Day\" event revived Kid Vulcan.  Darwin's consciousness also reawakened inside Vulcan, but he was helpless to prevent Vulcan's vengeful attacks on the X-Men.  Telepathically liberated by Rachel Summers, during the conflict, Darwin regained physical form as his mutation quickly rebuilt his body.  After recuperating at Xavier's Institute, Darwin agreed to help Xavier locate Vulcan, who had left Earth bound for the interstellar Shi'ar Empire of his birth.  Rejoining the X-Men, Darwin helped commandeer a Shi'ar ship and they set off in pursuit of Vulcan.  Only to be ambushed by Warskrulls. Darwin witnessed Xavier's kidnapping and secretly hitched a ride on the kidnapper's shuttle, which arrived at the Shi'ar High Council's Starways.  Attempting to rescue Xavier, Darwin was captured and imprisoned after seeing former Shi'ar Majestor D'Ken reclaim the throne.  Confronted by Vulcan, Darwin learned of his plans to marry D'ken's sister Deathbird and to execute Xavier on their wedding day.  At the ceremony at the site of the M'kraan Crystal dimensional nexus, Darwin witnessed an assault on the ceremony by the X-Men and their allies, deposed Shi'ar Majestrix Lilandra and interstellar pirates, known as the Starjammers.  When Vulcan threw Xavier into the Crystal, Darwin dove in after him, protected from the Crystal's mind-shattering effects by his mutation.  Darwin rescued Xavier and retreated with him to the X-Men's ship, unaware that Lilandra had pre-programmed it to return them to Earth to ensure Xavier's safety.  Later, when the Hulk sought to kidnap Xavier, Darwin opposed him alongside the X-Men, the New X-Men and X-Factor Investigations.  Darwin's power reacted by absorbing the gamma energy from the Hulk; however, Darwin was forced to leave the battle when his power instinctively teleported him away in response to Hulk's savage assault.",

      "biography": "Alison Blaire was born to Carter Blaire and Katherine Blaire in the Long Island suburb of Gardendale, New York.  Her parents had a tense relationship: her father was a stoic law student, while her mother was a free-spirited entertainer.  Ultimately, this led to Katherine walking out on Carter and a toddler-aged Alison, leaving Carter to raise Alison with the help of his mother.Katherine's leaving had a profound effect on Carter, who had kept the shameful secret of Katherine from Alison all her life.  As Alison entered adolescence and developed dreams of becoming a singer, her father became increasingly intolerant to the idea.  Instead, he forced Alison to choose a life path similar to his own; Alison would become an academic star, and continue on a path to law school.  Alison's grandmother, Bella Blaire, was more sympathetic to young Alison, and encouraged her to explore her creative energies.However, while performing at a middle-school dance, Alison manifested her mutant abilities, blinding all in attendance save herself.  For years, Alison kept her powers a secret from those closest to her, further alienating her from her father.  By the time she reached university, Alison began to explore her powers and her musical ability.  She crafted her own performing suit and accessories, naming herself \"The Dazzler.\"  It was at this moment Alison decided to abandon her father's dream.  While at her graduation ceremony, Alison informed Carter that she would not be attending the law school he had selected for her, and would pursue a life as a singer, without her father's blessing or financial support.The Dazzler used her light-based mutant powers as a draw for her performances. Taking the sound of the music and converting it into dazzling displays of color drew the young singer enough attention to land her gigs at several New York clubs and discotheques. However, Alison knew that she, a mutant, would have to keep the nature of her powers a secret. Marketing her light shows as a \"technological secret,\" Alison was able to bypass critical speculation for some time. Yet while this little white lie fooled the club managers and others in her life, it did not escape the notice of Emma Frost, White Queen of the Hellfire Club, or Charles Xavier, founder and mentor of the X-Men.Both the Hellfire Club and the X-Men sent entourages to a Dazzler performance to recruit Alison to their respective ideological side.  The X-Men sent Phoenix, Cyclops, and Nightcrawler to have a discussion with the young woman, while the Hellfire Club sent a group of armed men to take her by force.  The combined powers of Dazzler and the X-Men suppressed the foes, and the new team also worked to free other members of the X-Men held captive by the Hellfire Club.  Professor Xavier offered Alison a position within the X-Men, but she declined, instead choosing to focus on her career.At this time, Alison became an increased target for superheroic phenomena.  In one instance, she was possessed by the foe Lightmaster, and was thankfully saved by Spider-Man.  In another, she acquainted herself with Johnny Storm -- the Human Torch -- at a posh nightclub.  As the Dazzler was becoming more popular in the club circuit, she was becoming more known in the superhero circuit as well.This co-mingling of superheroes and career proved both beneficial and detrimental to Alison.  Needing a well-deserved break, Alison auditioned and won a performance spot at up-and-coming nightspot Numero Uno.  Unfortunately, the singer bested the Enchantress, who -- so incensed by the outcome -- vowed to have revenge upon the Dazzler.  As her new superheroic friends packed the club, the Enchantress summoned her minions, erupting in a large battle.  It was Alison herself who sealed back the Enchantress' nefarious energies, ending her plans.  While she won a battle against a powerful adversary, her performance was in ruins. Despite this outcome, Alison continued to follow her dream.  When given lemons, the Dazzler made lemonade.  She signed on as a singer with a reputable agent -- Harry Osgood -- and was given a formal stage manager, back-up band, and a knockout performance spot at a United Nations charity summit!  Unfortunately, before she could perform, the Dazzler encountered Doctor Doom, intent on stealing one of the \"Jewels of Doom\" currently held on display at the UN.  Dr. Doom then used the chanteuse to retrieve another of these jewels from the villainous Nightmare in his Nightmare Dimension.  In the dimension, Dazzler was confronted with her own self-doubts and insecurities her father planted within her.  Overcoming this obstacle, Alison retrieved the jewel and destroyed them.  As Doom was to seek retaliation, the Human Torch came to her rescue.  The Dazzler again survived a brutal encounter, but at the expense of her career.But for Alison Blaire, her powers still proved to be a curse.  While riding the New York subway, a couple was being harassed by men with armed weapons.  Alison quickly used her powers to subdue them, only to find that she, then, became the enemy.  The couple she \"saved\" quickly began harassing her, and as a crowd formed to assail her, she fled.  Clearly, there was no place for mutants in the larger society.Her career fared no better.  After another performance was soiled -- this time by Hulk -- Harry Osgood became increasingly curious over the nature of Alison's stage effects.  The \"technological secret\" was in question.  When Harry confronted Alison about the nature of her powers, she stormed out, defensive.  How could she reveal her true identity?  To make matters worse, an old enemy of Osgood sent the Enforcers -- a group of mercenaries -- to harm him.  When Harry Osgood was kidnapped, Alison made it her mission to find and protect him.  After defeating the Enforcers and saving Harry, she confessed to Harry her most hidden secret: that she was a mutant!  Not knowing how the first non-superhero would react to such a revelation, Alison breathed a sigh of relief when Harry gave her his support, and vowed to keep her \"technological secret\" safe.Alison's \"technological secret\" may have been safe regarding the average citizen, but for the U.S. Government, it was a pressing affair.  Alison was whisked away by Project: PEGASUS against her will to undergo several strenuous tests regarding her mutant powers.  While at PEGASUS, Dazzler witnessed several other super-powered beings being held captive, including Klaw and Solarr.  As time went on, Alison became increasingly intolerant toward the members of Project: PEGASUS.  The researchers found that Alison had no natural limit to her abilities, and theoretically could be the most powerful mutant on Earth, with unlimited energy potential.  Intolerance swiftly turned into aggression, and -- upon witnessing Klaw being tested by PEGASUS technicians -- inadvertently freed the villain.  Klaw then turned his energies upon Dazzler, unaware that her mutant ability transformed sonic energy into light-based energy. As Dazzler began to absorb Klaw's essence, she found she could not stop the process.  The Dazzler had fully absorbed Klaw into her body, storing it as light energy.Unable to cope with her \"murder,\" Dazzler used the energy to free herself from the confines on PEGASUS.  The strong energy signature alerted the space entity Galactus to the young mutant, who abducted her as a means of retrieving his renegade herald, Terrax.  Galactus then imbued Dazzler with the power cosmic -- a source of unlimited sound energy, allowing the human to enter a black hole to retrieve the herald.  Dazzler succeeded in her task and, using her virtue of compassion, convinced Galactus to pardon Terrax and return her to Earth.Amidst it all, Alison suffered several bouts of trial... and error.  For one, she could not hold a decent relationship.  Wanting to get away from the superhero circuit, Alison dated Dr. Paul Jansen, who after weeks of courting, proved to be unable to adjust to Alison's unconventional lifestyle.  Likewise, Alison could not hold down a gig to save her soul, inconveniencing both her manager, Harry, and her band.  Most disconcerting, Alison was literally on trial for the murder of Klaw.  Enraged by the outcome of her stay at PEGASUS, the agency decided to file suit against Alison.  For days, she feared for her life, but with the help of lawyer Kenneth Barnett, she was pardoned.  Things turned upward for the singer.  Alison began to date Ken.  And she began speaking more and more with her grandmother, Bella, although relationships remained tepid with her father.  The relationship became more icy when Alison began wearing her mother's locket as a tribute to the woman she never knew.  Despite this setback, Alison was determined to make it big.  And she did.  She was allowed to tour the West coast as a warm-up singer for rock star Bruce Harris.  Unfortunately for the Dazzler, her act proved so good that it became a threat for the star, and Bruce nixed her from the tour.Disheartened, Alison returned home, whereupon she was courted by none other than former X-Man Angel.  The Angel attempted several times to win the Dazzler's heart, and decided the key to success lay with finding her mother.  Unfortunately the Angel, a close friend of Alison beat her to it!  Katherine Blaire was hiding as Barbara London, a matronly vocal coach.  Katherine followed Alison throughout her budding career, but could not bear to confront the daughter she had abandoned.  Alison's family situation was about to reach a climax.Alison's biggest break yet finally lay at her footstep: a prestigious gig at Carnegie Hall!  And her budding romance with Angel proved that her life, finally, could reach a harmonious center: the Dazzler lived her dream, and could truly be herself with a fellow mutant.  It didn't last long, as her father fell into a psychological stupor.  Carter Blaire awoke to confront Alison with the truth about her mother, Katherine.  She did not simply leave the family, but rather slowly denigrated into an unfaithful drug addict who left Carter to be with her new beau, Nicholas Brown.  Alison could not believe the horrid story, and left in tears.  Her energy had to go toward her career, and no longer her family.  She didn't know, however, that Katherine had left the abusive Nick Brown and hid away as Barbara London.Alison's friend Vanessa convinced Barbara to attend the Carnegie performance, and Carter convinced himself to make amends with his daughter.  The family re-united after the performance, with Alison finally coming face-to-face with her mother for the first time in her memory, and also developing a new understanding for her father.  All was not as simple as it seemed. Barbara had married Nicholas Brown, and also had a daughter -- Lois -- leaving Alison with a half-sister! Alison attempted to form a relationship between both Barbara and Lois London, quickly befriending her new sister. However, other complications arose.  The Sisterhood of Evil Mutants -- Mystique, Rogue, and Destiny -- sought revenge on the X-Men, and decided that the Angel would be an appropriate source of information. The trio attacked Warren; however, Alison defeated the trio of villainesses. Rogue vowed revenge on the Dazzler, becoming increasingly jealous of her popular and attractive lifestyle. Unfortunately, the mutant gene was alive in both sisters. Lois' powers manifested while being harassed by a homeless derelict, and, unfortunately killed the man in the process. Terrified, Lois asked for Alison's assistance. The two fled New York as fugitives, hiding on the road and assuming brief false names to avoid being tracked by the authorities.  Worse, an unidentified photographer took photos of the incident, blackmailing the women into murdering a wealthy Californian man in exchange for the film negatives.As the duo went to meet this Californian, he turned out to be none other than Nick Brown -- Lois' father!  The photographer was hired by Nick to track his daughter, Lois, and decided to use the evidence as further blackmail for a financial profit.  Nick then offered Alison several social connections to the West Coast elite, including photographers and actors -- including the famous Roman Nekoboh.Alison and Nick's relationship turned sour.  And when Lois opted to stay in her biological father's comfort rather than with the sister who uprooted herself for her own benefit, Alison left.  Alone and with nowhere to turn, she began to start her life anew, renting an apartment in San Diego and taking a job as an aerobics instructor and part-time model.Roman Nekoboh had a particular interest in Alison.  He helped introduce her to other members of the Hollywood elite, but particularly wanted her to star in a new film of his.  Suspecting she was a mutant, he wooed Alison into divulging her hidden secret, and convinced Alison to \"come out\" as a benefit to mutants everywhere.  Thus, Dazzler: The Movie was born, highlighting the ups and downs of her many adventures, and the social good mutants offer to society.  Over time, Alison succumbed to the allure of a wealthy, spoiled lifestyle.  As she was in a relationship with Roman, Alison allowed her emotions win over her better judgment, and agreed to a public relations stunt that would publicly unveil her as a mutant.  Several jet engines supplied Alison with enough power to demonstrate the magnitude of her abilities.  However, the sound proved too great, and it backfired, frightening and scattering onlookers.As a result, negative press mounted against the singer.  Protests against Roman Nekoboh -- a mutant sympathizer -- mounted.  At a private press screening, a riot erupted.  Alison could not believe the reaction, and went to confront Eric Beale, her financial backer.  Beale, obsessed with Dazzler as an object of sexual desire, would only release the movie on condition Alison sign a contract making her his sole creative property.  Blackmailing Alison in a bout of sexism and racism, Beale noted that the film would improve the world's opinion of mutants, and that she should take the personal sacrifice not only for her career, but also for the social good.  In a final act of defiance, Alison rejected Beale, destroyed the only known copy of the film, left Roman, and return to pick up the pieces of her life.Always optimistic, Alison attempted to start from square one. Sadly, there was no work to be had in a society that left mutants on the outside of it. Rejected from the most menial of work, Alison gave up hope. She was left to peruse parties as a low-level socialite all while still being barraged by negative tabloid press. This left Alison emotionally susceptible to others. When a charismatic man named \"Flynn\" approached Alison about a community where she could call home, there was little she could do to refuse. Alison was increasingly ashamed of her mutant powers that brought her so much pain. With the aid of a drug that caused Alison to lose control of her powers, Flynn gained the influence he needed to control the Dazzler. Alison joined Flynn's group -- an underground group of mutant \"gladiators\" that battled one another to the death for the amusement of a wealthy human elite. With the assistance of the Avenger Beast, Alison was able to break free of her emotional insecurity and the psionic influence that plagued her, and together the two brought an end to the gladiator ring. The following events did little for Alison. She tried to get perfuming gigs as often as she could under pseudonyms. And even then she was still assailed by villainous characters.  Eventually she sought solace with the band of fellow mutant rock star Lila Cheney, who brought Alison to the New Mutants. Two members of the New Mutants had fallen into the ranks of a new gladiator ring, and once again Alison succumbed to the allure of the limelight, no matter how brutal. The events of the second \"Secret Wars\" broke Alison away from the gladiators, and she fell into an awkward relationship with the Beyonder, a cosmic being who found Alison to be the most beautiful and one of the most powerful beings on Earth. She rejected his advances.After overcoming the shame she felt for her powers, Alison turned to the X-Men for assistance in honing her mutant abilities.  Agreeing to the request, Professor Xavier gave Alison a suit amplified and gave precision to her powers.  Alison then turned to the road, combating villains and owning her role as a super-hero. The new twist was short-lived, A bounty hunter named O.Z. Chase was hired to apprehend the Dazzler for a meta-human duo named Dust and Silence.  The two needed Alison's light effects to awaken a latent drug in humans, giving them meta-human abilities.  To coerce Alison, the villain Dust possessed the body of her father, Carter Blaire.  However, Dust's abilities caused the slow breakdown in the organic matter of the host, ultimately killing Carter.  Alison and O.Z. fought of Dust in Carter's body, leaving him for dead, and searching for Barbara London, who was being held by his counterpart, Silence.Silence captured Alison, and forced her to use her mutant abilities for her goals.  If she did not cooperate, Barbara would be killed.  Luckily, a team of friends rescued Alison and Barbara, and Alison rechanneled her light energy as a concussive sound force to kill Silence.  Alison then faked her own death to hide from the authorities and the press that so plagued her life.The Dazzler again went into hiding as a member of Lila Cheney's back-up band.  However, her inability to seize the spotlight made her an easy target for the psychic entity Malice, who was eagerly looking for ways to attract the X-Men.  Possessing Dazzler, Malice made Alison a threat to those around her, calling the X-Men to her aid.  Once Malice was defeated, Alison reluctantly joined the X-Men, as her identity and safety were compromised.Alison's alliance with the X-Men brought many adventures.  Alison was forced to confront and cooperate with Rogue, a one-time adversary who wished to kill her.  While the two heroines formed a tepid friendship, it was tested several times as Rogue envied Dazzler's relationship with teammate Longshot; Rogue even dressed and posed as Dazzler to court the man's attention.With the X-Men, Alison also learned to rely on teamwork and cooperation.  Being used to tackling the Marvel Universe's largest villains solo, Alison attempted to halt the Juggernaut by her lonesome.  Fortunately, Juggernaut did not wish to cause the singer harm, and Alison merely passed out from overexertion.  After this, Alison learned to use teamwork more effectively in subduing later foes.In one battle, Dazzler, along with the X-Men, sacrificed their lives to subdue the Adversary.  Resurrected by Roma, Dazzler and her teammates were now \"living legends\" who were thought dead, and invisible to any sort of mechanical perception.  Dazzler had faked her own death to hide from the world, and now it was a permanent aspect of her reality.The X-Men gravitated to Australia to confront a band of cyborg looters known as the Reavers.  The team then took over the Reavers base in the Australian Outback, where they made permanent residence.  Alison, accustomed to the social life of New York City and Southern California, often grew intolerant of the new environment.However, the Dazzler provided a much-needed source of entertainment and verve.  Exhausted from many missions and the social isolation of the Australian desert, Alison would frequently tour local bars and venues to sing and interact with non-teammates.  In one event, she brought her fellow female team members to a mall where they indulged in a day of shopping and frivolity.  Make no mistake, the Dazzler was the life of the party.  Even stowaway orphan Jubilee found comfort in Dazzler's quarters: the teenaged mutant found an immediate kinship in the extent of Alison's wardrobe!It wasn't all fun and games, however.  Dazzler had undergone a body-swap with the villain Diamondback, was subject to the malevolent psychic forces when a demonic inferno engulfed New York, and had been blinded by the villain Spiral.  Alison was also besieged with visions of her life in the different paths she could have taken: lawyer, mother, singer, superhero, and bum.  This insecurity fueled her post-inferno, where a glimpse into the jewel of the Siege Perilous showed her varied demises in each life path.After Alison's fateful visions, the team fell apart.  While defeating Master Mold, Alison blasted her teammate Rogue through the mysterious portal.  Wolverine left the team without any warning to unknown whereabouts.  Longshot faded from reality to \"find himself,\" and Havok accidentally killed Storm.  The four remaining teammates: Dazzler, Colossus, Havok, and Psylocke, attempted to carry on, but under threat of the Reavers' coming onslaught banished themselves through the Siege Perilous where Rogue had fallen weeks before.Alison awoke on Malibu beach, unaware of who she was.  Her former allies Lila Cheney and Strong Guy discovered her and took her into their company.  Unfortunately for Alison, she was in the middle of a maelstrom involving Dazzler: The Movie.  A copy had survived and found by a young acquaintance of Alison's.  Meanwhile, Eric Beale had become obsessed with the Dazzler and vowed to kill her.Dazzler: The Movie was at last publicly screened, and Alison had defeated Eric Beale.  However, she could not remember her true identity.  Even as her other teammates had rediscovered themselves, Alison could not recall, and her former love Longshot re-encountered her before the X-Men.Longshot went to the amnesiac Dazzler for help, and Lila Cheney teleported the trio from harm's way.  Alison slowly regained her memories, and chose to stay with Longshot on his native world, and assist him in his fight for independence.  Alison became pregnant, although lost the child.After several years abroad, Alison returned to Earth following a cataclysmic destruction of Mojoworld.  Finally putting herself first, Alison jump-started her career in her classic Dazzler digs, where all seemed well.  Unfortunately, a worldwide turn of events for mutants made the career short-lived, and once again Alison returned to low-level performances in the United Kingdom to make ends meet.She has since joined the superhero team Excalibur, finding solace in a world where she is once again a minority. She recently began singing again, and after one particular gig in an English night club she was killed by an evil Jean Grey, when her body was taken to the hospital and checked on she seemingly woke up from her death, a full diagnosis of her body stated that she was fine and her body was in working condition. With the help of her Excalibur teammates they put an end to the faux X-men team. After her first adventure with the Excalibur team she had another death experience when The Juggernauts old friend returned for a vengeance against him, Black Tom Cassidy returned with only a few of his mutant abilities when Dazzler, in the middle of fighting with him, was shot in the back by one of his henchmen and seemingly died (again) after a few moments she got up from her death and aided in defeating Black Tom. The Excalibur team was concerned about how and why she came back from the dead again but Dazzler seemed to care nothing about it. When Camelot was destroyed in the past with the help of the Dark Knight, Dazzler and Excalibur aided in defeating the evil forces at hand. Recently when Juggernaut wanted to receive the full power of the Crimson Gem of Cyttorak, Nocturne of the team wanted to help Cain and stop him from making any mistakes, but Dazzler didn't care this put her at odds with her best friend on the team. Nocturne stated that Dazzler did not deserve the love that Cain gave her because she would always be a performance girl waiting to be in the fame lights. Though seemingly reluctant Dazzler stopped the agent of Cyttorak and Juggernaut from retrieving the crystal",

After serving a jail term, Burt approached his brother, Warren Jr., for help in supposedly starting afresh in life; however, Burt instead became the costumed criminal the Dazzler, and used his brother’s money to finance an illegal diamond-smuggling syndicate. From his secret base beneath the Statue of Liberty, the Dazzler sought world conquest by means of a giant diamond-powered laser dubbed the Spatial Destructor. When his brother accidentally uncovered his plan and threatened to report him to the authorities, Burt had his hired goons kill him. Learning of his father’s death, Warren Worthington III, in his identity as the mutant hero the Angel, sought vengeance on the Dazzler. Each unaware of the other’s dual identity, Burt had Warren teleported to his base and imprisoned alongside Warren’s then-girlfriend Candy Southern, whom Burt sought to use as leverage. Warren escaped and confronted the Dazzler as the Angel, but was unmasked by the Dazzler’s men. Surprised, the Dazzler revealed his own identity to Warren as well as his plan, and used a device to brainwash Warren into stealing a diamond large enough to power his laser; however, the brainwashing failed due to Warren’s mutant nature, and he returned with a fake diamond which overloaded the Destructor. Warren rescued both Candy and Burt from the explosion, but Burt attacked him in mid-flight, causing Warren to drop his passengers. As Warren flew to save Candy, Burt seemingly fell to his death.In truth, Burt survived thanks to a carefully-laid contingency plan, and he subsequently set about wooing his brother’s widow Kathryn in the hope of accessing the Worthington family fortune he had earlier been denied. Burt’s plan seemingly came to fruition after Kathryn fell in love with him and they planned to marry. Upon learning of this, Warren returned home with his X-Men teammates to confront Burt, intending to expose his villainous nature; however, Warren was dissuaded by the family’s Doctor Stuart, who warned of Kathryn’s frail nature. Ultimately, it was revealed that Burt and Doctor Stuart, who secretly hated mutants, had conspired to poison Kathryn by dosing her tea so that she would die shortly after the wedding. However, an impatient Burt had increased the dosage, resulting in her condition worsening on the wedding day. Burt then attacked the X-Men as the Dazzler, but Warren defeated him. Kathryn died soon after, and Burt and Doctor Stuart were taken into custody. While still in prison, Burt began dealing with the mutant werewolf Maximus Lobo, a rogue employee of Worthington Industries who has claimed to be the true culprit behind Warren's father's murder.",

      "biography": "Dead Girl was once a young mutant woman who moved to New York to become an actress. Murdered by a one-night stand, she revived using her mutant power and killed her murderer. Relocating to California, she became a freelance adventurer, and soon joined the publicity-seeking mutant team X-Force, accompanying them into space to battle the Bush Rangers, renegade government mutates. When teammate U-Go Girl died during the mission, X-Force's leader, Mister Sensitive, renamed the team \"X-Statix\" per her final request. As the team reorganized, Dead Girl dated fellow member Anarchist, and the two briefly embarked on a \"Death and Anarchy\" roadshow, capitalizing on Dead Girl's ability to recover from any lethal attack.Over the next few months, Dead Girl performed X-Statix missions in Africa, Malaysia, India and elsewhere, often proving herself a savage combatant. She faced a personal crisis when telepathic messages from the dead warned that mortician Brad Gutman was defiling corpses in his care. She killed Gutman rather than allow him to molest the corpse of his daughter Britney, then revived him long enough for him to be attacked by the ghosts of those he had assaulted. When another resurrected woman, mutant pop star Henrietta Hunter, joined X-Statix, Dead Girl shared her teammates' dislike of the newcomer; but after the maniac Mister Code slew Hunter, Dead Girl helped her spirit get vengeance on her original killers.X-Statix eventually decided to retire on their wealth after one final mission; Dead Girl accompanied her teammates despite an unexplained illness which ultimately re-killed her, and the rest of X-Statix were slain during the mission. Months later, the spirit of a dead super-villain known as the Pitiful One led the Anarchist, Mysterio, Kraven the Hunter, and Miss America out of the afterlife, in forms much like Dead Girl's, to wreak havoc in New York. Needing an ally familiar with the realm of the dead to face this threat, Sorcerer Supreme Doctor Strange contacted Dead Girl, who led his astral form to recruit the spirits of Phantom Rider, Ant-Man, Mister Sensitive, and others.",

      "biography": "Welcome to the Deadpool character bio, nerds! I mean...True Believers! Brought to you by me, myself, and I: the fabulous Deadpool! I could have let some smelly pencil-pushing intern spell out my life story for you, but you deserve better.\n\nSo, here it is, straight from the Merc with a Mouth's mouth—every detail of my morally ambiguous, mentally unstable, innuendo-laden past. From my very first appearance in NEW MUTANTS #98, to my latest booty-kicking, comic relief-ing anti-heroics, to a third thing that I can't think of right now, this is the definitive history of Deadpool.\n\nOkay, intro's over. Let the solemn origin story fade in?\n\nSection One (My Origin)\n\nCall me Ishmael.\n\nJust kidding. Don't do that.\n\nLike any misunderstood hero, I probably had a difficult childhood that led to my career as a professional killer. That, or someone brainwashed me into murdering my parents. If I don't remember, does it really count? Or matter?\n\nLet's just say that I was an orphan, a wizard put me on my aunt and uncle's doorstep, they raised me in secret, and then I went to a special magic school where a bald man regularly tried to murder me with voodoo.\n\nOkay, that's not true...but I do have a scar on my forehead! Several, actually!\n\nAnyway, seriously, I joined the military at 17 years-old, but was discharged soon thereafter. So, naturally, I decided to become an assassin (which is, by the way, an incredibly fun word to write).\n\nThen I met Wade and Mercedes Wilson, a young couple that nursed me back to health after an early failed job. Some may say that I killed them both in an attempt to steal Wade's identity, but guys, come on. I'm the real Wade Wilson.\n\nWhile working as a hired gun, I met the expensively beautiful Vanessa Carlyle, and we made a perfectly dysfunctional pair. I then got an assignment to kill a British operative named Althea (important moment readers, I'm meeting my best friend here) but decided to kill everyone else instead. Doing this made my employers...unhappy. So they tried to kill Vanessa. Luckily, a special agent named Zoe Culloden—who'd been spying on me to try and convert me into some kind of messiah protector—rescued Vanessa. Weird subplot, I know.",

      "biography": "Like Eternity, Lord Chaos and Master Order, and Infinity, Death is an abstract entity embodying the concept of the mortality and extinction, inasmuch as its opposite, Eternity, embodies life. Death and Eternity even regard themselves as siblings, having come into existence at the moment the universe was formed. During the times that Death has manifested itself on the physical plane, it often takes the form of a skeletal female; however, the body Death chooses to manifest as can be in any form or size. Death's motives and modus operandi are hard to fathom. It works in some kind of partnership with Galactus, a being who survived the destruction of the previous universe, and also provides some measure of power for Death-gods like Hela and demons like Mephisto, who are allowed to rule in her name over extradimensional realms inhabited by the souls of the dead.  Death seems to be always seeking out new conquests and may manipulate mortals with or without their knowledge in order to gain them. Death once attempted to destroy the vampire lord Dracula through human pawns because Dracula was depriving it of conquests by creating vampires who were neither truly alive nor truly dead. Death failed on that occasions, but Dracula eventually fell victim to permanent destruction.Although Death ordinarily seems content to maintain a balance in the universe between its power and Eternity's Death will seize opportunities that arise to achieve dominance over Eternity. Death once appeared to the mad Titan Thanos in the form of a woman with whom he fell so much in love that he was willing to destroy the universe in order to please her. Indeed, nearly all of Thanos' activities from that point on involved his desire to win Death's favor. When Thanos possessed virtual omnipotence by means of the Infinity Gauntlet, however, Death, for reasons of its own, turned its back on him. Thanos himself has yet to fathom Death's motives for this relationship.Death has on occasion taken the role of gamesman, having once played a tournament of champions with the Elder to the Universe called the Grandmaster, the end result of which proved the Grandmaster and fellow Elders immune to Death's power.At one point, Death was \"killed\" by the Beyonder, who later \"recreated\" it. The implications of this on Death's nature are still a mystery.Later, Death appeared to the Phoenix Force, claiming it to be the product of power of all life yet unborn, and thus somewhat an agent of Death and abstract entity the likes of Eternity and Death. Death helped to convince the Force to leave its then-current avatar, Rachel Summers.Death has seemed to take a fascination with the mercenary known as Deadpool, appearing to him on several occasions in the context of a somewhat romantic nature. Again, the implications of this are still a mystery, even to Deadpool.Death's ultimate goals are unknown. There may be a master plan guiding its movements or nothing more than random chance. Virtually all living creatures in the known universe must eventually surrender themselves to Death. Even the offshoot of humanity known as the Eternals and the otherwordly Asgardians age, although they do so very slowly, and will someday die. Olympians do not age, but can be killed by a sufficient powerful force. Galactus, the only known entity said to predate the creation of the universe itself, has since died. Death remains one of the greatest mysteries of the universe.",

      "biography": "In 2016 A.D. on Earth-8410, Advanced Idea Mechanics' Precognitive Data Collection unit predicted an unknown threat would obliterate the agency in the near future. A.I.M. funded Dr. Evelyn Necker's Minion Project to create a perfect warrior cyborg to fight this threat. After working the bugs out on a prototype (Death Wreck), she finished her Minion cyborg in 2020 A.D.; to obtain the best experience, he was sent out through time and space to kill 106 of the deadliest individuals in the multiverse and assimilate their instincts; however, as the cyborg absorbed more and more victims, he began to display personality characteristics not programmed into him, worrying Necker. While slaying target 103, Tyler Wilson, Minion encountered a future target, the bounty hunter \"Freelance Peacekeeping Agent\" Death's Head, who had been seeking to claim the price on Tyler's head; angered at being beaten to his prey, Death's Head pursued Minion. Next Minion eliminated the barbarian Lehdrox K’Vant and freed the precog Phaedra, who called him \"Death's Head\" as she departed. Moments after he returned to 2020, Minion was attacked by Death's Head; however the peacekeeping agent was outmatched and swiftly assimilated. Since Death's Head was mechanical rather than organic, Minion absorbed his victim's entire mind, not just the instincts. Ignoring Necker's orders to wait for system checks, Minion teleported after the final target, Reed Richards of Earth-616. Necker followed, warning Richards in time for him to evade Minion's initial assault. Minion pursued Richards to Four Freedoms Plaza, where Richards used a neuron scrambler to allow Death's Head personality to come to the fore. Seeing a programming loophole, the cyborg absorbed the data in Richard's computer, completing his mission without harming Richards, then departed, free of A.I.M. control. Meanwhile, back in 2020, the previous Death's Head body was bonded magically to necromancer Baron Strucker the Fifth, ironically creating the very threat A.I.M. had foreseen, Charnel. Death's Head time-jumped to the planet Lionheart, 3442 A.D., a world where artificial sentients were forbidden, where he spent twelve months under the alias Hood leading an outlaw band of cyborgs and robots, the Merry Men. Shortly after the replicated organic Tuck joined the outlaws, the Merry Men were slain by the mutant Major Oak; Necker, who had caught up with Death's Head, stunned Oak before he could kill Death's Head. They returned to 2020 to find A.I.M. decimated by Charnel, who had now fled back in time to destroy A.I.M. at an earlier point, intending to wipe out this timeline altogether. Pursuing him to the modern day Earth-616, Death's Head, Tuck and Necker allied themselves with another group of time-travelers, the Avengers from the devastated future timeline Charnel was destined to create. Charnel arrived seconds later, slaying most of the Avengers before Death's Head used two time devices to send Charnel simultaneously into both future and past, ripping him apart. Deciding to stay in the present day, Tuck and Death's Head stole a truck and headed into Manhattan. Before long, they encountered the Avengers, Fantastic Four, Hulk, Vorin of the Shadow Riders, Rick Jones and Black Axe. Death's Head was summoned to the alternate future of Earth-9939 — in which Charnel had conquered Earth — to meet his \"brothers\", Death Wreck and Death Metal. Unfortunately, Death Metal, designed by Necker as a replacement for Death's Head, was sympathetic to Charnel's cause, informing him that Death's Head's actions had negated this timeline and that a temporal wave would soon wipe it out. Before Charnel could travel back in time to prevent this, the three cyborg brothers united to destroy him, with Ghost Rider's Penance Stare having caused Death Metal to switch sides. During a mission to Matricca Scorpio to locate a cure for the Perfection virus for Lady Anula of Lionheart, one of Death's Head personalities, Die-Cut, freed himself from the Minion body and recreated his physical form. Death's Head and Die-Cut worked together for the mission, then parted ways. Later, hired by the people of Numeropolis to reclaim an intelligent gun stolen from them by Tigon Liger, one of Mys-Tech's dimension-hopping Warheads, Death's Head and Tuck battled Liger's Kether Troop while they were trying to steal the powerful Sapphire Lotus. Though the pair failed to retrieve the gun, they did escape with the Lotus. Returning to Earth-616, Death's Head and Tuck found the Lotus' energies drawing numerous superhumans to them, including the X-Men and Wrathchilde. Empowered by the Lotus, and alongside a possessed Tuck, Wrathchilde fought a series of battles with the X-Men and Death's Head, until defeated with the aid of Phaedra, who also sent Tuck home through the dimensions to recover. Realizing home meant Lionheart, a concerned Death's Head swiftly followed, but was detoured to Un-Earth, a voodoo copy of Earth created by Mys-Tech, where he fought both demonic doppelgangers and Kether Troop. As Mys-Tech used Un-Earth to unleash unparalleled carnage across the globe, many of Earth's heroes rallied to stop them; most died, but the survivors, including Death's Head, used the Un-Earth to take time back a day to restore normality. Trying once more to reach Lionheart, a disorientated Death's Head instead ended up in the pocket realm of Inner Space, battling Mys-Tech and the Anti-Being — the collective evil of the Mys-Tech Techno-Wizards' millennia of malevolence — with the assistance of Dark Angel (Shevaun Haldane). Finally reaching Lionheart, he was reunited with Tuck and battled Major Oak and the technological wizard Methinx. Death's Head returned to 2020 A.D., seeking to discover whom Necker had killed to procure his organic components. The Light Brigade, dedicated to preventing paradox, stopped him from interfering in his own creation, and sent him back to Earth-616, to seek answers from Necker in that time zone. Though briefly diverted from his mission twice to fight alongside Killpower and other Earth heroes against the demonic gestalt known as the Battletide, Death's Head finally located Necker's mother, Stealth of the armored mercenary Requiem Sharks, whom he convinced to assist him. They found Necker having ensconced herself in present-day A.I.M., working on yet another Minion cyborg; unfortunately, the human component of this Minion proved to be the past half of the time-split Charnel, who used A.I.M. technology to reunite his scattered parts and threaten the world anew. Working together, Necker, the Sharks, Tuck and Death's Head just barely destroyed Charnel before he grew too powerful to stop. Subsequently, Death's Head fought the Metamorph alongside Motormouth and Killpower; the Lemurians of Earth-313 hired him to capture the Knights of Pendragon; and the Time Guardian recruited him to join the Dark Guard and prevent Mys-Tech from spreading their influence across the universe. On an alternate future Mars colony circa 2026 A.D., Tuck and Death's Head fought android duplicates created by the Alkemist, then—learning Major Oak had decimated their cyborg allies back on Lionheart with technology supplied by Noon and General Cicatrice — they tracked the latter pair down to exact revenge, aided once more by Phaedra. Death's Head was snatched through time by Chronozone, who tried to dupe him into destroying humanity in the past, then later was transported to the interdimensional time port Maruthea by the Time Lord known as the Doctor to assist his Freelance Peacekeeping predecessor against the robot Hob. Time traveling once more, he stopped off in 2099 A.D. to hunt down a man called Burgen. Death's Head has also been seen amongst the many Avengers gathered for the interdimensional, transtemporal Destiny War, apparently indicating that he or a dimensional counterpart will someday join the Avengers, though in which reality remains to be seen.Phaedra has foreseen at least two probable futures for Death's Head; she claims he will one day rule a galaxy, bringing about a millennium of peace, and also that he will become the godlike Psyphon, whom Death's Head once met in the Bewilderness, the Khiasmos of the Universe. At odds with these futures, in the Earth-811 (Days of Future Past) reality, Death's Head was slain by Sentinels while fighting alongside the Resistance Coordination Executive, while in Chronozone's timeline, Death's Head died defending humanity. Given Death's Head's dimension and time-hopping proclivities, it is impossible to say which, if any, of these futures is the \"true\" destiny of Death's Head, and which belong to his dimensional counterparts across the multiverse.",

      "biography": "Deathbird is the first-born of the Shi'ar Royal Family, a humanoid alien race descendant of bird-like creatures. Due to a throwback gene sequence, Deathbird was born with wings, which enabled her to fly. During her years as a respected member of the Royal Family she taught martial arts to Gladiator, and became the Empire's best hand-to-hand combatant. For unrevealed crimes she was stripped of her name and banished from Chandilar, giving her the name of Deathbird. Her brother, D'Ken, was next in line for the throne, and he became Emperor of the Shi'ar Empire. Deathbird arrived on Earth on mysterious circumstances and while attempting to retrieve her spaceship she fought Ms. Marvel, and later Hawkeye. When she was finally able to leave the planet, she allied herself with the Brood in order to recuperate her throne, now in the power of Lilandra, her younger sister. Stranding Lilandra on Earth by implanting a Brood parasite on Professor X, she returned to Chandilar and usurped the throne. Lilandra allied herself with the Starjammers and created a resistance against Deathbird's rule. They battle for many months, but eventually, Deathbird was forced to escape.  Deathbird rescued Lila Cheney and made her teleport the X-Men to her, asking them to slay Professor Charles Xavier. The X-Men were rescued by Lilandra and the Starjammers, and soon joined them into fighting the Shi'ar Imperial Guard, who still followed Deathbird as ruler. Soon after, the newest members of the X-Men Gambit and Jubilee witnessed as Xavier took over the minds of Oracle and Gladiator, and forced Gladiator to remove her natural wings. Gambit and Jubilee reacted, saving Deathbrid's life, however they were overpowered by Xavier and Gladiator. Deathbird, escaped thanks to Lila Cheney. Soon after Wolverine slaughtered Xavier, and Lilandra, newly crowned as Majestrix of the Shi'ar Empire,  proclaimed the X-Men were traitors and had be put in jail. Seconds later, Lila Cheney and Deathbird returned, and teleported Storm,Banshee and Forge away. The X-Men allied themselves with Deathbird and together exposed the Warskrulls, saving the real Professor X and the rest of the X-Men. Deathbird then officially abdicated the throne, claiming the life of ruler was boring.When the Kree and the Skrull went to war, Deathbird slaughtered the Kree rulers. After the Shi'ar won the war and conquered the Kree Empire, Deathbird was named Viceroy of the Kree territories, which she ruled with an iron thumb. Under unknown circumstances, Deathbird was found by the X-Men as the sole survivor of a Shi'ar Space Station. She immediately found herself attracted to the X-Man Bishop. Together with the X-Men they stopped the threat of the Phalanx, restoring peace to the Shi'ar Homeworld, Chandilar. Deathbird was chosen by the Majestrix herself to escort the X-Men back to Earth. However the X-Men's ship exploded in mid-travel, and Deathbird and Bishop were stranded in space. They crashed into an alien planet and fought their way out of it. Months later, they crossed a faulty stargate, which took them into an alternate future reality, where Earth was ruled by the Shi'ar. Alanna Neramani, daughter of Xavier and Lilandra, offered Deathbird to rule Earth, while Bishop joined the Resistance. Eventually, Deathbird chose to follow Bishop and helped the Resistance defeat Alanna. The pair later returned to the 616 reality.As they approached Earth, they found a gigantic humanoid shape, which had a mutant signature. Confused, they approached it, but after finding nothing on it, Deathbird betrayed Bishop, firing on him and delivering him to the hands of a mysterious cult. Weeks later, Deathbird appeared as War, a Horseman of Apocalypse, with a pair of artificial wings to replace those she had lost. She helped Caliban, the Horseman known as Pestilence, against X-Force and Cable, and ensured the latter's capture. Deathbird then fought Iceman and captured him. Soon after, as Apocalypse's plans backfired, Deathbird and the rest of the Horsemen fought against the X-Men. Amidst the battle, Bishop was sent to Earth-9910 and Mikhail Rasputin teleported the Horsemen away.Months later, Earth was turned into a prison planet by the Galactic Council of Selandiar. Deathbird had found her way to another Shi'ar Space Station, and she murdered all the Shi'ar stationed there. As Cadre K searched the station, Bishop returned to the 616 reality once more, only to find Deathbird, who used him as a human shield against Cadre K. Bishop teamed up with the Professor X-led team of mutant skrulls to defeat Deathbird, who in the end gave him a key to enter Ronan's Watchtower in Earth orbit, and then opened a hatch and flew towards open space.",

He saw service across the world; against the ninja Hand; and saved the U.S. President from assassination by a rogue Dum-Dum Dugan LMD. Tasked with apprehending Cable, Truman unleashed Zzzax in Hell’s Kitchen to draw out and weaken his prey, then  moved in and captured Cable, in spite of heavy-handed interference from S.H.I.E.L.D.’s Air Cavalry, led by Larry Young.Learning the ExTechOp division was using Cable in experiments to create controllable, artificial intelligent agents, and desiring a fair rematch, Truman freed Cable, but during their subsequent fight, a ruptured turbine bathed Truman in burning fuel. He clung to life, ironically handed over to ExTechOp, who put him through inhuman experiments; with sight his only remaining sense, Truman tried a Tibetan technique to bounce his psyche into S.H.I.E.L.D. employee Ted Bailey, then inadvertently into Ted’s six year old son Billy. Meanwhile his body’s brain and nervous system were transplanted into a new Deathlok cyborg, built using technology harvested from Machine Man; when the Nazi Red Skull invaded the Helicarrier, Douglock activated Deathlok and later released him into the outside world. The mindless cyborg rampaged through Las Vegas, pursued by Larry Young’s Air Cavalry and Zero Company, until “Billy Bailey” arrived to reclaim his body. Back with S.H.I.E.L.D., Truman led a cyborg squad to overthrow Central American dictator Miguel Mezro; discovering ExTechOp had been in cahoots with Mezro, Truman went A.W.O.L. He visited his sister in L.A., where he fought Puff Adder, before being brought back to S.H.I.E.L.D. to retrieve the missing Nick Fury. Truman found Fury running a crime family, hypnotized by Presidential hopeful, Martin Thraller (secretly the Ringmaster). Truman restored Fury to his proper mind, and saved him from being slain by the Clown (Eliot Franklin). Though suffering from mounting headaches and nightmares as his mind rejected his cyborg form, Truman aided Fury in bringing down Thraller. The mission completed, Truman located the dishonorably discharged Larry Young, and swapped bodies with him, leaving Young trapped in the cyborg while Truman departed, human once again.",

This C.I.A. project, spearheaded by Simon and his brother Harlan was designed to build armies of cyborg super-soldiers. However, each Ryker had his own agenda, causing them to split from the C.I.A. Simon wished to use the cyborgs for world domination, while Harlan saw the cyborg form as perfection and wanted an army of his Homo Ascendent to replace humanity with cyborgs. After five years in stasis, Manning’s body was reanimated as the cyborg Deathlok. He was named so, because he can be locked in a death-like state. Harlan Ryker directed Deathlok’s construction but soon went off on his own, converting himself into the cyborg Hellinger and continuing to design his own Alpha-Mech warriors.Simon Ryker oversaw Deathlok’s training and early missions, but the cyborg began to rebel against his programming as his human memories returned. Escaping Ryker’s control, Deathlok learned that he was legally dead and that his wife had since married his old friend Mike Travers. Despondent, but incapable of suicide due to his internal programming, Deathlok devoted himself to ruining his former master. Having been transformed into a cyborg himself by Harlan after suffering injuries during the Heroic Age, Simon sought to merge with the Omni-Computer with oversaw the city, becoming the powerful cyberspace entity the Savior Machine. However, Deathlok forced him out of the Omni-Computer with the aid of C.I.A. agents, leaving Ryker hopelessly incoherent from the rapid reversals he had suffered. The C.I.A. tried to restore Deathlok to life by transferring his mind into a clone of Manning, but succeeded only in duplicating his memories in that body, leaving Deathlok essentially unchanged.Deathlok worked for the C.I.A. (focusing on the threat of Hellinger), but shortly after encountering the time traveling Spider-Man of Earth-616, he met the enigmatic Godwulf. A rebel working to liberate America, Goldwulf was actually a repentant former member of the Nth Command. Trying to prevent Hellinger from locating Deathlok, Godwulf displaced him across time prior to Operation: Purge. Arriving on Earth-616, Deathlok aided the occult agent Devil-Slayer against the demon-worshipping Cult of Vera Gemini. Goldwulf tried to restore Deathlok to his own time, but Hellinger had observed his banishment and tried to lock onto Deathlok himself. However, Deathlok was instead pulled back to Earth-616 by the Fixer and Mentallo, who implanted a control device into him and used him in a plot to assassinate the U.S. President. Foiled by the Fantastic Four and shape-changing alien Impossible Man, Deathlok was captured and his control device eventually disengaged by London’s top cyberneticist and bio-geneticist, Professor Louis Kort. Remaining stuporous, Deathlok was taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody and later stolen by agents of Roxxon.Deathlok was studied by Earth-616’s Harlan Ryker at Roxxon’s Brand Corporation subdivision, who designed a robotic Deathlok which was destroyed by the Thing and Quasar while invading Project: PEGASUS. The original Deathlok was re-programmed as an agent of Nth Command, who had been developing their Operation: Purge. Meanwhile, in Earth-7484’s year 1993, Godwulf sent the Luther Manning clone back to Earth-616 to locate Deathlok. Deathlok slew him, but the dying Manning’s touch somehow restored his memories and neutralized his programming. Deathlok led Captain America to a portal to his time, where they joined with Godwulf and his Redeemers (Big Man, Gentle Sam, Iron Butterfly, Sage and Swashbuckler) in defeating Hellinger before his army of Doomsday-Mechs could attack humanity. Hellinger took control of Deathlok’s cyborg systems, but his human mind resisted and he slew Hellinger. Captain America returned to Earth-616, using his new knowledge to shut down Nth Command and prevent Operation: Purge, diverging the two realities. While working at Cybertek, Earth-616’s Harlan Ryker later designed his own Deathlok for the U.S, military, into which was placed the brain of soldier John Kelly. However, when Kelly disputed mission orders, the onboard computer lobotomized him. A computer copy of Kelly’s mind subsequently operated the Siege cyborg, also designed by Ryker. The next Deathlok was pacifist Michael Collins, whose brain was placed into the cyborg against his will. He escaped Cybertek’s control, becoming a heroic vigilante for a time.Back in Earth-7484, Deathlok and the Redeemers followed Godwulf against foreign monarch Timestream, who, unbeknownst to all save Godwulf had been empowered during Operation: Purge and had supported Hellinger’s defeat. Timestream’s base was destroyed, but the Redeemers died and the assault sparked retaliatory nuclear attacks from three sides. Deathlok abandoned Godwulf after learning he had been withholding information. Deathlok subsequently worked alongside a rehabilitated alien Deviant Lord Tantalus, but ultimately failed to lead the world to a better future. Learning that the Red Skull (Johann Shmidt) had backed Nth Command and that his agents were rebuilding Operation: Purge in Earth-616, Deathlok revisited that reality, where his systems suddenly shut down and S.H.I.E.L.D. captured him. Believing him under their control, S.H.I.E.L.D.’s Dr. Parker repaired and upgraded him, but Deathlok suddenly rebooted and escaped, destroying the Purge technology and returning to Earth-7484.In 2011, eighteen years after Hellinger’s defeat, the cyborg Manning fought for survival as the Demolisher, his computer having long since crashed. He was recruited by Timestream (secretly the foreign monarch he had fought years before) and agreed to help him in exchange for altering time so that he would never have become Deathlok. In reality, Timestream’s mad plot endangered Earth-616, Earth-7484 and all of time itself, leading the regulatory Time Variance Authority to send Godwulf to stop him. Timestream recruited the Luther Manning of Earth-616 to assist his agents, while Godwulf enlisted Earth-616’s Siege (John Kelly) and Deathlok (Michael Collins). After various time travel expeditions, the Demolisher learned Timestream’s secrets and turned against him and Michael Collins destroyed Timestream. Still disgusted with Godwulf, the Earth-7484 Deathlok stole one of his time gauntlets and traveled to Earth-616, where he lived in solitude in Manhattan’s sewers after briefly working with the Tunnel Dwellers society. He was later drawn into a massive struggle involving the heroes Daredevil (Matthew Murdock), Blackwulf (Lucian), the Tunnel Dwellers and the long retired Peacekeeper against agents of the Kingpin (Wilson Fisk), the mercenary Bushwacker, the mad King of the Sewers and his cult and the Mayan Devourer. After saving the innocents living beneath the streets, the Demolisher wandered off, to contemplate his existence.",

      "biography": "Jason Macendale, the newest Hobgoblin was down on his luck and having a hard time in the supervillain business. After being beaten up several times by Spider-Man and once by the Green Goblin, he offered the demon N'astirh his soul in exchange for power during the Inferno crisis. N'astirh was amused by the mortals request he bonded a demon from the \"Otherplace\" with Jason, giving him superhuman and supernatural powers. Yet while he gained these grand new powers his body and face started to become an exact replica of the Hobgoblin mask. With his newfound powers the demonic Hobgoblin was hired to attack Doctor Strange at an event. Jason agreed and began an assault against the sorcerer supreme, using his own mystical might against the doctors. Jason ultimately lost and then set out killing several different mercenaries until he was confronted by Moon Knight. The fight that then began eventually led to Moon Knight's mansion where Spider-Man joined the fight and the two heroes defeated the demonic Hobgoblin.Jason was then taken to Tombs Prison and incarcerated where Jason Macendale and the entity now known as Demogoblin physically split apart. Demogoblin then broke out of jail and started to \"cleanse the sinners\". He was then rescued by the Doppelganger and was confronted by Code: Blue, who took down Demogoblin despite not having any superpowers. Demogoblin was then once again captured, but this time telepathically summoned Doppelganger, who set him free. This caught the attention of Spider-Man who quickly rushed to apprehend Demogoblin and Doppelganger. During the battle Venom was drawn into the fight and eventually Ghost Rider and Blaze joined the battle, the result being Demogoblin's arrest again.Some time later Moon Knight began to experience bizarre spells of dizziness and his face began to slowly decay. Deciding that Demogoblin was to blame he paid the demon a visit in jail and demanded to know what he had done to him. During a telepathic and physical scuffle Moon Knight learned that Demogoblin had planted a virus in him that was slowly taking over his body. The result of the virus separated from Moon Knight and became known as Pang. Moon Knight then defeated Demogoblin once again, leaving him in his jail cell. He was freed and joined a gang which included Carnage, Doppelganger, Shriek and Carrion. Together they torn New York apart until Spider-Man and his fellow super heroes put a stop to the madness. Defeated once again Demogoblin became disheartened as he was taken back to prison. He busted out again sometime later and attempted to team up with Blade, sensing that he too wanted to punish the wicked. Blade however was corrupted by the Darkhold and killed Demogoblin. Demogoblin however was resurrected sometime later. He then ran afoul of Venom several times, he even ran into Morbius once or twice. Always beaten and sent back to prison he began to ponder his \"mission\". A few months later he broke out again and sought out Jason Macendale for forgiveness. When he finally caught up with Jason he asked him for his forgiveness, but Jason refused to believe it and the two started a fight in a local church. During the battle Demogoblin noticed a pillar which was dislodged during the battle was falling towards a mother and her young boy. Asking for forgiveness he rushed over and saved the mother and son, holding the pillar for a few seconds until it crashed on top of him. The pillar's weight crushed Demogoblin, killing him.",

      "biography": "As a young man, Dennis Dunphy idolized costumed super heroes, especially Captain America and Daredevil. Dunphy was a successful college football player and tried to go professional before realizing that his skills weren’t sufficient after he wasn’t picked up by any of the teams he tried out for. He stayed in good shape and hoped for his big break until a man at the gym told him about the Power Broker (Curtiss Jackson), a mysterious businessman who could grant Dunphy superhuman strength for a price. Dunphy underwent the augmentation process, increasing his bulk and endurance, and the Power Broker said he would need regular stabilization pills to remain healthy; Dunphy did not learn until later that fifty percent of the augmentees became monstrous, mindless brutes, and he was unaware that the “stabilization pills” were addictive drugs designed to ensure the loyalty of the Broker’s clients. Now far too strong to play football against normal men (whom he could easily kill by accident),Dunphy returned to Power Broker for advice on potential careers. They directed him to seek a career with the Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation (UCWF), which pitted super-strong wrestlers against each other for public entertainment. Sporting a Mohawk and calling himself Demolition Dunphy, Dennis was chosen to face the Fantastic Four’s Thing (Ben Grimm) in the first public UCWF match during a period when the Thing had disassociated with the Fantastic Four; however, UCWF founder Ed Garner tried to pay Dunphy to throw the match, fearing audiences would hate to see the celebrated Thing lose. Dennis refused the bribe and helped Thing persuade Garner to keep the new league legitimate, but the Thing won the match anyway.\n\nDunphy met Captain America (Steve Rogers), who was investigating the Power Broker and one of his suspected clients, the Super-Patriot (John Walker, later USAgent/Jack Daniels). Seeing an opportunity to become a super hero, and seeking vengeance on the Broker for turning himself and his wrestling colleagues into addicts, Dunphy canceled his professional commitments, shaved his head and donned the outfit patterned after Daredevil’s. Calling himself Demolition Man (or D-Man for short, playing on the word “demon”), Dunphy helped Cap find Karl Malus, one of the scientists responsible for the Broker’s augmentations. Dunphy soon proved himself by rescuing Cap from a deathtrap arranged by Malus; however, Dunphy was soon after captured by several augmentees, and then further augmented by Malus, straining his mind and body. When Cap rescued him, a crazed Dunphy attacked the hero before succumbing to a heart attack; though Malus reversed the process, Dunphy was briefly hospitalized and he has had recurring heart problems thereafter.\n\nMore recently, Dunphy became progressively more delusional and believed he had a divine mission to gather various gems (which he apparently believed to be the powerful Infinity Gems), stealing jewels from the scenes of robberies he had thwarted. Reporter Ben Urich and Dunphy’s boyhood idol Daredevil (Matt Murdock) convinced D-Man to leave the sewers and seek professional help, and Dunphy was arrested for vagrancy. Despite his legal troubles, Dunphy was considered a potential recruit by the U.S. government’s Initiative program after the passage of the federal Superhuman Registration Act.\n\nDunphy has superhuman strength (lifting up to 15 tons), endurance, and durability. He has a history of cardiac problems linked to severe physical exertion. He survived for months encased in ice, though it left him slightly brain-damaged and sometimes delusional. An expert wrestler trained in unarmed combat by Captain America, Dunphy can pilot Avengers Quinjets and is a capable motorcyclist.",

      "biography": "Eric Simon Payne grew up in Queenstown, Illinois, to an abusive and alcoholic father and battered mother. Payne sought salvation in enthralling books and mindless violence, in pretty girls and petty crimes. He would later marry a nurse, Cory, and join the American military and serve as a Marine in Vietnam. After his tour of duty, he was left bitter and shell-shocked, dismayed by the loss of innocent life and feeling betrayed by his country. Furthermore, his wife left him for another man. He felt his once-unquestioned obedience resulted in alcoholism and the loss of his innocence, his idealism, and his wife.Payne made his way to the Italian mob, specifically Carlo Boccino. Boccino took Payne in, treating him like a brother and giving him a job as a high-profile assassin. Payne seemed grateful, initially. However, Boccino once ordered Payne to kill a journalist that had been hounding him, named Ian Fate. Unfortunately, the pipe bomb Payne used killed Fate's wife and child instead. Distraught by the loss of innocent lives, Payne fled Boccino's employ.Payne was sought out by the Cult of the Harvesters of Eyes, who sensed his nascent psychic abilities. Payne was led to believe the cult's promise of a new way of life and he became an initiate. Payne excelled at his training in the cult, developing a fantastic array of physical and mental powers. He eventually grew into one of their highest roles -the Reaper of Souls- the cult's assassins of death. However, when Payne learned of the cult's true agenda, to unleash demons on the world, he believed the cult had used him and that he was betrayed once more. He turned against them and left, taking the powerful shadow cloak with him. Payne struck out on his own, becoming a renegade demon hunter, calling himself Devil-Slayer. He devoted himself to destroying the cult and stopping its so-called \"xenogenesis\" program that would restore an ancient race of demons to domination over Earth.At one point, the cult managed to capture the powerful object known as the Eye of Agamotto from its owner, the Sorcerer Supreme Doctor Strange. The cult's leader Vera Gemini extended an offer to Payne to return to the organization in anticipation of its triumph, but Payne refused. Although they were at a restaurant, Payne transformed into his Devil-Slayer identity to fight Gemini, gaining the attention of the heroes Valkyrie and the Hulk. The two mistakenly battled Devil-Slayer, allowing Gemini to escape, until Payne could explain. Valkyrie took Payne to her team, the Defenders, and Payne agreed to join them. Together, the Defenders defeated Vera Gemini and stopped the xenogenesis. Payne parted company with the Defenders afterward.Payne later found his wife Cory in Israel, a member of a cult following a self-proclaimed messiah named David. Payne confronted the false prophet with the Defenders, who were seeking out and battling various demons who formed the organization called the Six-Fingered Hand. Cory decided to stay with the few remaining followers of David, and Payne went on to join the Defenders against the Hand and, ultimately, the Hand's true masters, the lords of Hell and Satan himself. When Satan's true purpose was revealed, to keep his son, the Defender Hellstorm, in Hell with him, the Defenders returned to Earth.As Devil-Slayer, Payne served with the Defenders for a brief tenure. At one point, he encountered a homeless drug user called Sunshine. Payne helped him overcome his dependency and Sunshine clung to Payne like a loyal puppy. Later, Payne was confronted by Ian Fate who was seeking revenge on Payne for killing his family years earlier. Fate had since become a powerful sorcerer, and he kidnapped Cory, holding her life in balance as his demon servants battled Payne. Sunshine put aside his own withdrawal pains to elicit help from the Defenders, who then proceeded to help Payne defeat Ian Fate. In the final battle, Cory seemed to be fatally stabbed by Fate's demons, but it turned out to be Sunshine, mystically altered to resemble Payne's wife, who sacrificed himself.Payne suffered a crisis of conscience, spiraling into depression, drunkenness, and attempts at suicide by standing on the edge of the matter-annihilating dimension of the Negative Zone. He once again believed his legacy was only death of the innocents around him. His attempts at suicide were punctuated only by teleporting to Earth to confront various aspects of his past, but each left him empty and void of resolution. Ultimately, he ended up in Israel and was rescued by Cory. Cory, who had since found truth and solace in Christianity, professed her love for her former husband, and he returned to her and to her faith. Payne turned himself in for the crimes he committed in the past, and was remanded to custody in Israel, and later, to the witness protection program in the United States.Years later, Payne resumed his Devil-Slayer identity. (The details of his reformation remain to be revealed.) He was somehow contacted by an American military general to ostensibly talk about the xenogenesis plot. Payne, intrigued how a military general would know about the xenogenesis, agreed. The general met Payne at a bar, revealing himself to be Belathauzer, one of Vera Gemini's first demons to be released on Earth. He had set a trap for Payne, drugging him to nullify his psychic powers and attacking him with a horde of demonic allies. Payne pulled forth the sword Dragonfang from his cloak, the sword once used by his teammate Valkyrie. Belathauzer hoped to gain control of the shadow cloak for himself, but the cloak mysteriously transported everyone on the scene to the other-dimensional land of the dead, where Valkyrie and her allies had seemingly died in defeating the Dragon of the Moon. Payne ultimately killed Belathauzer and his demons, believing that the Valkyrie had been the force that drew him there and helped him against Belathauzer.Payne was suffering another attack of self-conscience when he was confronted by the spectral ghost of the Flying Dutchman on behalf of the demon Mephisto. The Dutchman took Payne aboard his ghostly pirate ship and hoped Payne would renounce his soul in exchange for his offer of luxury, wealth, and pleasure. Payne refused and was deposited in the Central American village of Potega, where the country was embroiled in a civil war sparked by communist revolutionists. Psychically disguising himself as a Rambo-like soldier of fortune, Payne used weapons taken from his cloak to fight back the communist People's Liberation Army and win the favor of the priest. He continued to fight for the defense of the village, even fighting against United States armed forces who were helping the country against the Liberation Army.Determined to defeat Payne, Colonel McCloskey, the leader of the American forces and a former friend serving with Payne in Vietnam, and Colonel Ramirez, the leader of the People's Liberation Army, decided to team up against him. The Flying Dutchman enticed the two into receiving hi-tech weapons capable of combating Payne's in exchange for their souls. They were also aided by the treachery of the Mayor of Potega, who betrayed Payne's hiding place. In the resulting confrontation, the priest of Potega was killed and Payne's shadow-cloak was believed to be destroyed. The only weapon he was able to retain was a mystical staff with a curved blade. McCloskey, Ramirez, and the Flying Dutchman confronted Payne, seeking refuge in the church, in a climactic battle that seemed to literally verge on the brink of Hell. Ramirez fell into the flames, presumably lost, and Payne doused the Dutchman with a vial of holy water, defeating him. Potega and its people were back to the way they were before Payne arrived, although McCloskey's soul still appeared bound.Payne took the opportunity to retire his Devil-Slayer identity, realizing that he won a second chance at freedom from his past. Months later, Payne appeared on the doorstep of Doctor Strange, a dagger plunged into his chest. He was rushed to the hospital and Doctor Strange began a search for his attacker, the magician-killer, Silver Dagger. Payne survived, only to be later found at the Rosewell Sanitarium, a mental hospital in Massachusetts. By this time, Payne had succumbed to the fact that, although he and Cory had remarried, Cory had died, a victim of mob retaliation, and with her, his faith. Payne spent his time often lost in telepathic hallucinations, and his only solace was a mute inmate named Sorrow, with whom he could communicate telepathcially.When the magical gateway known as the Nexus of All Realities became fragmented, one of the fragments somehow became lodged within Payne. This brought him to the attention of the enigmatic Mister Termineus, who was interested in manipulating events to bring about the threatened end of creation that began with the Nexus' fragmentation. He confronted Payne, giving him a gift in the form of a demon. The demon turned out to be a physical manifestation of Payne's personal \"demons\" he always battled with, and Payne transformed into a form of Devil-Slayer, complete with cloak, in order to battle the legion of demons that were then unleashed. Not only was his madness given form, the entire hospital and soon the city itself began to be subsumed into a nightmarish parallel dimension. The dimensional guardian Man-Thing and his wife Ellen, who were charged with reconstructing the Nexus of All Realities, teleported to the scene, and Payne turned on the Man-Thing. The battle ended in a conflagration and, as the two burned, reality began to reassert itself. Ultimately, Man-Thing reverted to his normal state, and Eric Simon Payne was reborn. The fire had apparently burned away the cocoon of suffering and madness that had been tormenting him, and Payne turned the fragment of the Nexus over to Ellen.Thus reborn, Payne partnered with his fellow inmate Sorrow, whose sole purpose seemed to be to call people to the Rosewell Sanatorium, people who needed spiritual healing and provide such healing by allowing them to follow her to an astral plane connected to the hospital. The two appear as luminous beings to those they help, while maintaining their identity of patients at Rosewell.",

      "biography": "Little is known of Lillian Crawley’s life before joining the Canadian government’s Department H in the Gamma Flight training program for the super-team Alpha Flight. She briefly romanced her teammate Madison Jeffries before the Department was shut down, after which Crawley and her former teammates were recruited into Omega Flight by Delphine Courtney, android assistant to Jerome Jaxon. Omega Flight was sent to attack Jaxon’s old rival James Hudson, who was Alpha Flight’s leader, Guardian. Crawley was easily bested by Shaman before Hudson was seemingly killed when his battle-suit exploded. Imprisoned, Crawley and her teammates were freed by Courtney to attack Alpha Flight once more; however, they were defeated by Jeffries and imprisoned again. The Canadian government later sought to replace Alpha Flight as their officially-sanctioned team, and Crawley was pardoned to join a new Gamma Flight. She first visited Jeffries hoping to rekindle their relationship, but found him engaged to Hudson’s widow Heather. Crawley was swept up in Alpha Flight’s battle against Llan the Sorcerer, after which she remained with Alpha and renewed her relationship with Jeffries.At some point, Crawley discovered a lump in her breast. She ignored it hoping it would go away, but when it continued to grow she had it examined. Doctors were unable to perform a biopsy due to her impenetrable skin until after Alpha Flight’s battle with the alien Consortium, during which Crawley was wounded by a laser and, in an act of desperation, killed the weapon’s owner to claim it; the cyst was diagnosed as benign. After Jeffries almost died in Alpha Flight’s battle against Diablo, he proposed to Crawley and she accepted. Resigning from active duty with Alpha Flight so they could marry, Crawley soon became concerned over her husband’s apparent addiction to adventuring with his Box robot. Nonetheless, she agreed to join him on a mission with an ad-hoc team of Alphans to combat the demonic Carcass. Subsequently, Jeffries was recruited into a restructured Alpha Flight, but was captured on the team’s very first mission. Crawley came to Department H looking for him, but was abducted by Doctor Horatio Huxley and subjected to experiments involving the weaponization of the Thetagen-24 bacteria. Huxley’s plot was ultimately uncovered by Alpha Flight, and Crawley was rescued. Later, Crawley was among those mutants captured by the Weapon X program and imprisoned in “Neverland,” a concentration camp that was ironically built by her husband while under Weapon X’s control. Disturbed at seeing perversions of Jeffries’ Box robot operating as guards, Crawley openly challenged their authority. However, all mutants in the camp had been depowered, and she was severely beaten by the Boxbots.Since the advent of House of M|\"M-Day\", Crawley has found herself a member of the mutant refugees collectively known as the 198.",

      "biography": "Raised in Austin, Texas, the Leighton family eventually moved to New York City. Growing up on the streets of New York was rough. Rachel got involved with the wrong crowd and ended up joining a local gang called the Savage Crims. The leader, Brock Rumlow (Crossbones) eventually brutalized Rachel to the point her two brothers assaulted Rumlow.Years later Rachel would join one of Taskmaster’s academies to receive training in order to find a purpose in her life. There she met Anaconda for the first time and eventually learned that one of the instructors was Brock Rumlow. After her training was complete Rachel took the name Diamondback and was contacted by Sidewinder to join the Serpent Society. Her first mission as part of the group was to track down and kill MODOK. During this mission she fought and was instantly smitten by Captain America. The Serpent Society was hired to steal items for Llyra and Ghaur. During this mission Mr. Jip caused Diamondback and the X-Men’s Dazzler’s bodies to switch with each other. While teaming with the X-Men to get her body back, Rachel took the opportunity to steal the item Llyra and Ghaur desired. During her next encounter with Captain America she betrayed the Serpent Society and led Captain America to their headquarters. Diamondback and Captain America attempted to save the members of the Society who had sided with Sidewinder. Diamondback abandoned the Serpent Society once the battle was over.Diamondback and Captain America began to develop a relationship and eventually went on their first date. Asp, Black Mamba, and Anaconda acted behind the scenes to ensure that the date would go by uneventfully.After learning of Diamondback’s involvement with Captain America, the Serpent Society’s new leader, King Cobra placed Diamondback on trial by the Serpent Society fearing she would reveal the Societies secrets to Captain America. Diamondback was found guilty and sentenced to death. Black Mamba and Asp contacted Sidewinder, who rescued Diamondback. King Cobra retaliated by capturing Asp and Black Mamba. Diamondback then hired Paladin to help her free her friends. With Captain America, Paladin and Diamondback freed Asp and Black Mamba, and the five combined to defeat the Serpent Society.Fearing retaliation from members of the Serpent Society, Diamondback, Asp and Black Mamba formed the mercenary group B.A.D Girls, Inc.. The remaining Serpent Society members captured Diamondback but MODAM intervened, kidnapping Anaconda and the B.A.D. Girls for Superia’s army of Femizons. While on Superia’s cruse ship, Diamondback was attacked and nearly killed by her old enemy Snapdragon. Traumatized, Diamondback decided to quit adventuring as soon as possible. Captain America and Paladin came to their rescue and the B.A.D. Girls Inc helped them defeat Superia.When Black Mamba pulled the image of Diamondback’s greatest fear (Snapdragon) from her, Diamondback quit the group. Diamondback tracked down Snapdragon in hopes to confront and overcome her fear of Snapdragon. During the fight between the two, Diamondback killed Snapdragon. Soon after this B.A.D. Girls Inc. lost their immediate goals and the group eventually dissolved.Diamondback was infected with mind-control nanoprobes and sent to steal information from the V-Battalion. During this conflict Citizen V (Baron Zemo (Helmut)) fried the nanoprobes in such a way that her central nervous system was severely damaged causing her to be paralyzed.B.A.D. Girls Inc. reunited when Cable hired them to steal a computer hard drive form the Dominus Corporation. After battling with Deadpool for the technology, they determined that it had already been stolen by Shen Kuei (the Cat), and they confronted him in Hong Kong. Aiding Deadpool against an army of Makeshift and Rive clones, they completed their contract and the trio went their separate ways.",

      "biography": "Not much of the early history of Jonathan Bryant is known before he started to work in Nakasoni Corporation’s London branch. He worked on a project Digitek. He had designed a state of the art computer using Protosilicon new component that was discovered quite recently. Protosilicon mimicked human brain tissue making the computer one living brain they called it Psi-Key. When they were running a test someone had contaminated the test program with a virus at the same time the room was invaded by hostile force and Jonathan also got shot in the progress. He fell inside the dome containing the Psi-Key and it linked to his brain downloading some parts of itself inside of him. The task force stole the Psi-Key and setup a bomb to cover their tracks. After they left Jonathan got up mumbling something in binary and noticing the bomb, but couldn’t do anything before it exploded destroying the building. Somehow Jonathon didn’t die and found his wife’s calling card from the rubble. He transferred himself through phone lines to his apartment trying to convince his wife that he was Jonathan. When he touched his wife he absorbed some electricity and noticed that it made him feel stronger. He then sucked power from every power source and Digitek was born. His wife didn’t believe him so he decided to show her and when she saw what happened to his husband. She still didn’t believe him. He then reveled that Nakasoni was just a front the project was really founded by organization named Mys-Tech. She still didn’t believe him and tried to call the police, but Digitek escaped trough the same phone she was using.Next day Digitek went back to the Nakasoni Corporation buildings ruins searching for some clews and met Samantha there too. They found piece of the bomb and Digitek found out that Miracle Systems manufactured it. He then transported himself to Miracle Systems headcounters in London. When he arrived he was comforted by Bacillicons who had been affected by the virus turning them same kind of beings as he himself. They attacked him, but he again transported himself before they hit him. Purge ordered Byte and Kay to follow him. He used his wife’s beeper to come back the real world and almost instantly got attacked by the two villains. As the fight ensued Digitek learned that he could turn his arms to any kind of weapon he could imagine. Digitek managed to win the fight and escaped before Purge arrived. Digitek and Samantha went an old cottage in Costwold Hills. When the arrived there Digitek decided to call help and transported Deathlok there. After Digitek explained things to Deathlok and recharged himself Bacillicons attacked them. They managed to severely injure Byte, but were forced to retreat. Deathlok was transported back to United States and Digitek left with Samantha to London. Digitek and Samantha decided to attack Miracle Systems. When Digitek arrived he ran into Kay and after a short fight destroyed her. Then Purge arrived and fight ensued between him and Digitek. Fight went on for sometime and Digitek won by shooting Purge with his hand cannon, but Purge managed to upload his persona trough the phone lines to Mr. Greville. Who then attacked Samantha, but Digitek intervened. Purge graphed Digitek and throws him at the Psi-Key. It was big mistake, because when Digitek impacted with the Psi-Key he cleaned it from the virus and destroyed both Purge and Byte. It looked like he himself finally died too, but in his funeral he rematerialized next to his tombstone. He revealed that he doesn’t anymore need a solid body and is now just pure energy. They left the cemetery side by side.He resurfaced in America after the Civil War|recent events. He had been revealed to blow his own head off when he had been imprisoned in Negative Zone's new prison ment for the unregistered heroes. It's now suspected that it was a elaborate escape plan, since Digitek can only be harmed by extensive damage to his central processing unit.",

      "biography": "Psychiatrist Dr. Leonard Samson came to General \"Thunderbolt\" Ross with a plan to cure Ross's daughter Betty, who had been transformed into a crystalline form through a blood transfusion with the Sandman. Samson had technicians devise a cathexis ray projector that would drain off gamma particle energy and psionic energy from Bruce Banner as he transformed into the monstrous Hulk whom General Ross had long hunted. Samson theorized that as a result of this process, Banner would be cured of the physiological instability that continually transformed him into the Hulk. Hoping to save Betty and to be cured himself. Banner willingly participated in the experiment. The cathexis ray succeeded in turning Betty Ross back to normal, employing Banner's psionic energy.However, most of the psionic energy drained from Banner as well as a considerable amount of his excess gamma radiation remained within the cathexis ray projector. Motivated by scientific curiosity, and probably by a desire to gain superhuman powers for himself, Samson irradiated himself with the energies remaining within the projector. The result was that the slight, brown-haired psychiatrist was transformed into a massively muscled, green-haired superhuman with gamma-boosted strength. Banner himself seemed permanently cured, but he emotionally broke under the strain of seeing Betty, the woman he loved, being romanced by Samson, and exposed himself to gamma radiation, thereby undoing the cure.Samson later lost his superhuman physique and power when he took a blast of concentrated gamma radiation intended for the Hulk. However, months later Samson regained his gamma-mutated form and superhuman strength when he was bombarded by intensive radiation from an exploding gammatron, an experimental gamma-ray generator. He has remained in this form ever since. Doc Samson, as he has been nicknamed, has long sought to capture and permanently cure the Hulk. Samson worked as a university teacher during the recent time that the Hulk was traveling through different dimension, unable to return to Earth. But Samson returned to his pursuit of the Hulk once the monster reappeared on Earth.The Hulk hasn't been Samson's only focus although Banner is his primary center of attention. Samson was integral in the capture of the first known gamma-powered serial killer, Patchwork, as well aiding others who have been affected by gamma radiation such as the Initiative recruit, Geiger. Doc Samson had also been trying to help Penance of the Thunderbolts cope with his participation in the Civil War|tragedy in Stamford as well as delay, if not destroy, the rise of Norman Osborn.At an undisclosed time, Samson was kidnapped by A.I.M. and was used as an experiment by M.O.D.O.K. which resulted in him developing a split personality. For a time, Samson switched back and forth between his good and evil self, but his corrupted side eventually won the struggle for dominance and claimed the part of him that was Leonard is dead. He has joined a group of villainous masterminds known as the Intelligencia, and his greatest desire seemed to be the need to kill his former ally, the Red Hulk, thereby proving his superiority. He maintained contact with the superhero community as they were not aware, as of yet, of his shift in personality. Samson remained an integral part of the Intelligencia's plans as he was the key to manipulating the Red She-Hulk to do their bidding. His involvement in her brainwashing also proved to help save her life after she was stabbed through the chest by the son of Hulk, Skaar. Just seeing Samson's face was enough to enrage Betty to trigger the transformation and permit her healing factor to repair her injuries. Still, even with his participation that led to the Intelligencia's master stroke, something changed within him as he witnessed Banner sacrifice his humanity in order to save everyone. Samson attempted to help Banner siphon the immense amounts of gamma radiation back from the Hulk army as well as the \"Hulked-Out Heroes\", but his body couldn't take the strain. Samson willingly gave his life, but Leonard died a hero.",

Alone, the young Victor discovered his mother’s trove of mystical artifacts and set himself on a path of darkness when he realized her spirit was subject to a demon she’d bargained with.

Secure in his rulership and with formidable forces at his command, Von Doom set out to conquer the globe, as well as rescue his mother’s soul, and prove himself superior to Reed Richards, the only man he’d ever met who might equal his own scientific genius.",

      "biography": "Anthony Druid got his medical degree from Harvard, then went on to study psychiatry. He retired from his psychiatric practice after several years to devote more time to his growing interest in the occult. He supported himself by writing popular books on psychology and related matters and by lecturing. In the midst of his research for a second book on the occult, Druid was summoned by an ailing Tibetan lama apparently in need of medical aid. The lama put Druid through a series of bizarre mystic and spiritual tests to ascertain Druid's worthiness. Finding him worthy, the dying lama opened Druid's mind to its hidden powers and taught him the mastery of certain mystic arts. (Apparently, the lama was actually the Ancient One, mentor of the Earth's Sorcerer Supreme. Druid was one of the Ancient One's first attempts at giving a disciple a degree of his powers.)Druid had remained in seclusion for several years, investigating occult matters personally and in secret. At one point, he teamed up with other clandestine \"monster-hunters\", including Bloodstone and the Eternal hero Makkari, in stopping a threat from the underworldly Deviants. Soon, the Fantastic Four appeared, ushering in Earth's Age of Marvels, and later, Druid would find himself aiding the hero team Avengers against the Celtic monsters known as the Fomor.Doctor Druid was instrumental in freeing the Avengers Mansion from its occupation by the Masters of Evil, and he applied successfully for Avengers membership shortly thereafter. Not long after joining, Druid fell under the mental control of Ravonna (then called Nebula, later Terminatrix), who used Druid's mental powers to manipulate the Avengers into aiding her search for an ultimate weapon. Druid manipulated the other Avengers into electing him chairman to this end, but the Avengers soon discovered the plotters and opposed them in a conflict that ended with Druid and Ravonna being lost in the time stream.Druid eventually escaped, free of Ravonna's influence, rejuvenated into a younger version of himself and with a renewed purpose. He renewed his association with the Avengers as an occasional inactive reservist in hopes of mending fences with the group. For a time, he led the occult adventurers called the Shock Troop and later served with the Secret Defenders as the team's puppet leader under the auspices of Doctor Strange.More recently, Druid embarked on an obsessive quest to augment his magical powers, one which eventually led to his pact with Druidic gods of Celtic lore. The gods performed a grisly spell on Druid, binding him to nature in such a way to allow him to control plants and earth around him. Druid tried to surround himself with loyal followers, including the villain Nekra, who nevertheless supported and seduced Druid. Nekra, however, later summoned her true lord, Hellstorm, the Son of Satan, who battled Druid. Hellstorm mocked Druid, killing him and tossing his burning body in a garbage can.Druid was briefly resurrected alongside other fallen Avengers by the Grim Reaper, in order to serve in the Legion of the Unliving against the Avengers. He and the others broke free of the Reaper’s thrall, however, and returned to the afterlife.",

      "image": "https://terrigen-cdn-dev.marvel.com/content/prod/1x/226ock_com_crd_02.jpg",
      "biography": "Otto Octavius had a turbulent upbringing. His father, a factory worker, was abusive and violent towards both Otto and his mother, leading Otto to be shy and reclusive in school. However, at his mother's insistence, he was determined not to become like his father and threw all his efforts into his education, regularly scoring top marks. It was hinted that he was a low-level telepathic mutant whose powers emerged at puberty; this mutation may have been responsible for giving his father an aneurysm as his father went to beat him. His father's death in an industrial accident pushed Otto further towards the study of, and obsession with, physical science.\n\nBefore his transformation into the megalomaniacal archenemy of the web-slinger, Otto was a brilliant and respected nuclear physicist, inventor, and lecturer. He became the youngest person to serve on the National Board of Nuclear Science. He designed a set of highly advanced mechanical arms to assist him with his research into atomic physics. The tentacled arms were resistant to radiation and were capable of great strength and highly precise movement. They were attached to a harness that fit around his body.\n\nDuring an accidental radiation leak that ended in an explosion, the apparatus became fused to Octavius' body. It was later revealed that the radiation (or possibly his own latent mutation) had mutated his brain so that he could control the movement of the arms using his thoughts alone. The tentacles have since been surgically removed from his body, although Octavius retains the power to control them telepathically from a great distance. The accident also seemingly damaged his brain (although it was later suggested that what was interpreted as brain damage was in fact his mind rewiring itself to accommodate four extra limbs), and the scientist turned to a life of crime.\n\nThough Doctor Octopus himself tends to be portly, and in poor physical shape, he has recently been able to improve upon his physique. He was also near-sighted to the extent that he was legally blind without the aid of his extremely thick eyeglasses, but he no longer appears to suffer from that problem, presumably through the use of laser surgery. With his harness attached he is physically far more than a match for Spider-Man; in his first appearance he beat Spider-Man so badly that the wall-crawler considered giving up his heroic career until he was inspired to continue by the Human Torch at the time when the Fantastic Four was called in to fight Doctor Octopus.\n\nOver the years, Dr. Octopus has become one of most recognizable members of Spider-Man's rogues' gallery. He remains one of Spider-Man's most dangerous foes, having many legendary battles with him over the years. His crowning achievement was the near-fatal stabbing of Spider-Man's then-partner/lover, the Black Cat, who was placed in critical condition. This led to Spider-Man beating Dr. Octopus within an inch of his life. The trauma of the beating he received from Spider-Man left Octavius severely phobic of Spider-Man and spiders in general for years. This lasted until Spider-Man was forced to let his nemesis beat him in combat so as to allow him to break free of his fears and recruit him to save New York City from an exploding nuclear reactor.\n\nDoctor Octopus has worked with other supervillains on several occasions, most notably as the leader of the original incarnation of the Sinister Six. He has been a member of several versions of the team, and founded his own short-lived version of the Masters of Evil when his teammates from the Sinister Six proved too difficult to manipulate. Certain members of the Six have since attempted to murder him, to no avail.\n\nAt one point, a boy named Ollie Osnick ran away from home, having stolen his father's Octopus-like equipment. He intended to become Doctor Octopus' sidekick, which was to be very much ill-fated. After a brief skirmish with Spider-Man, Osnick was returned home, sans tentacles.\n\nDoctor Octopus was murdered by the insane Peter Parker clone named Kaine. Octavius's student Carolyn Trainer took over the identity of Doctor Octopus until Octavius was resurrected by a branch of the mystical ninja cult known as the Hand. Although Octavius had discovered Peter Parker's dual identity shortly prior to his death while curing Parker of a lethal virus created by the Vulture, he lost all knowledge of it upon his resurrection. The reason for this was the memories he regained came from a those recorded on a computer chip provided by his associate Trainer. That recent memory had not been recorded at the time of his death. It is as yet uncertain whether or not Trainer had some ulterior motive for remodeling Octavius's mind.\n\nAfter his resurrection, Octavius attempted to create his own personal assassin in the form of a villainous mutated entity he dubbed \"Spider-Woman\", and was involved in a plot involving using prosthetic limbs as mind-control devices, to create an army of minions. He also had to contend with a usurper, an arrogant, yet brilliant scientist named Carlyle. Envious of Octavius's power, Carlyle created his own version of Octavius's harness and then tried to kill him. At the moment, none of the other people who assumed the mantle of Dr. Octopus are currently active, either due to retirement, imprisonment, or, in Ollie Osnick's case, a decision to emulate Spider-Man instead.\n\nMost recently, Octavius resurfaced in the attempt to kidnap a Palestinian ambassador, in hopes of causing chaos for reasons unknown. His plot was thwarted by Spider-Man and his temporary sidekick the Kiwi Kid. Octavius is currently doing time in a penitentiary.\n\nCheck out others who have used the name \"Doctor Octopus\" at the Disambiguation Page.",

      "biography": "The legacy of Brother Voodoo dates back to the 17th century when a former slave named Laurent gained the power of the Loa. Empowered by the Voodoo god Legba with assistance from the earth goddess Gaea, Laurent used a spell to bind the spirit of his dead brother Alexandre to his own soul, transforming him into the Lord of the Loa to oppose zombies. Allied with French freebooter Captain Tyger, Laurent's legend would grow over the centuries, inspiring later successors, many of whom were known as Brother Voodoo. An early 18th century Brother Voodoo encountered the sorcerer Cagliostro. In the modern era, Jericho Drumm grew up in an environment immersed in the occult. While his brother Daniel embraced the local Voodoo (or Voudoun) legends, Jericho rejected this as superstitious nonsense. He eventually journeyed to the U.S.A. and became a prosperous psychologist. Twelve years after leaving Haiti, he was summoned back home to see his dying brother, who had been struck down by a Zobop (a false god) claiming to be Damballah, the Snake Spirit of Voodoo lore; in reality, this Damballah was a man possessed by the demon spawn of the Elder God Set, also named Damballah. Daniel asked his brother to study under Papa Jambo as he had done and become the new Brother Voodoo, but Jericho gave in to his rage and confronted the Zobop, who nearly killed him. Papa Jambo then tutored Jericho in the ancient ways of their people, culminating in a ritual which summoned forth the Loa (or spirit) of his brother Daniel and bound it to Jericho. Confident that he had found a truly worthy heir in Jericho, Papa Jambo allowed himself to die. Jericho then confronted the false Damballah and his Council Supreme, a union of leaders of dark cults across the globe. Jericho defeated him, tearing off the wangal (amulet) that gave him his powers, causing the villain to be killed by his own serpents. The Zobop's former servant Bambu swore allegiance to Jericho, recognizing that he was truly Lord of the Loa. Brother Voodoo and Bambu took up residence in a mansion near Louisiana's French Quarter. Jericho was soon called back to Haiti to battle Baron Samedi, who had worked with Advanced Idea Mechanics (A.I.M.) to create pseudo-zombies called Zuvembies. The majority of the Zuvembies were innocent men and women, stolen in the dead of night while paying respects to their loved ones in local cemeteries. Unlike true zombies, Zuvembies were not actually dead. A device created by Samedi and A.I.M. drained their minds but not their souls. Samedi hoped to use the device on Brother Voodoo himself, making him the vanguard of the Zuvembi forces. Jericho, however, summoned a lizard that chewed through the device's power cable. Voodoo made short work of Samedi and restored the Zuvembies to their natural state. Soon after, Voodoo saved the life of Loralee Tate, the daughter of New Orleans chief of detectives Samuel Tate. Loralee had been targeted by worshippers of the Black Rooster, but Jericho's attempts to protect her drew the wrath of her father, who temporarily issued an arrest warrant for the hero. With the aid of local priestess Mama Limbo, Brother Voodoo tracked down the now-missing girl and rescued her from the group's leader, the Black Talon. A houngan named Dramabu later revived Papa Jambo, using him as a zombie servant in a failed bid to destroy Brother Voodoo. Jericho's activities began to attract the notice of other heroes, and he soon found himself aiding them whenever voodoo entered their lives. Trailing a malevolent Loa named Moondog, Jericho visited New York City and helped Spider-Man halt the attempted slaying of young actress Gail Paris. Brother Voodoo then traveled to Brazil to help vampire hunter Frank Drake overcome a trap laid for him by Dracula. Drake, who had been suffering through a prolonged period of self-doubt, drew inspiration from Jericho and rededicated himself to hunting Dracula after their encounter. Months later, Jericho aided the Werewolf (Jack Russell) and his empathic ally Topaz against the evil machinations of Doctor Glitternight. Jericho was able to ease Russell's tortured existence by temporarily sharing his brother Daniel's spirit with the werewolf. While Daniel inhabited Russell's body, Russell could control the Werewolf's transformations and actions. After a harrowing battle with a zombie horde, the Werewolf entered the so-called Black Egg, which housed Glitternight's power. Within the Egg, Daniel lived once more, and physically assisted the Werewolf in defeating their mutual enemy. In the end, Daniel returned to his spirit state and once more occupied a spot within his brother's soul. Aided by the Thing, Jericho later uncovered a plot to kidnap prominent members of the black community. Entering a small African nation bordering Uganda, Jericho encountered the Voodoo priest W'Sulli, who had enslaved a vampire and transformed it into a form of zombie. W'Sulli was working with Dr. Kinji Obatu, who sought revenge against those who had wronged him. Jericho and the Thing defeated Obatu and W'Sulli, rescuing several notable celebrities, including the Black Panther. Jericho later tried to increase his own power through his enemy Damballah's wangal, and was possessed by the Set-spawn Damballah, but Dr. Strange freed Jericho and re-imprisoned the demon within the wangal. When the Grandmaster challenged Death to a Contest of Champions, Brother Voodoo found himself a part of the proceedings. He joined the hero Moon Knight against the Grand Bois, a terrorist who had been raising zombies in Haiti. Brother Voodoo was later ambushed in Haiti by agents of Doctor Friday, who used the Zhambi Concombre potion to place Jericho in a mindless, tractable, zombie-like state, intending to use him as a pawn. Jericho escaped and fought off the drug with the help of Moon Knight, and the two brought down Friday and his alliance with mobster Brutale. Earth's Sorcerer Supreme Dr. Strange secured Jericho's aid when Marie Laveau sought to revive the world's vampires; during this time, Bambu sacrificed his life to save Morganna Blessing, and his spirit played an unwilling role in resurrecting the vampire Varnae. Following this, Loralee spurned a desperately lonely Jericho, who had Daniel's spirit possess her so that she would love him. Finally overcome with guilt, Jericho removed Daniel, and Loralee left him. Seeking to regain his focus, Jericho wrote a book, Do You Voodoo, I Do!, and went on a tour promoting it, sometimes resorting to publicity stunts such as hiring an actress to play his alleged partner, \"Sister Voodoo\" (not to mention her son, \"Voodoo Chile\"). For a time, Jericho abandoned the Brother Voodoo identity because he had \"given up on brotherhood.\" Jericho investigated the zombie Nathaniel \"Nat\" Mare, whom Ellery Snow was using to avenge Mare's decades-old murder. Jericho also worked with Dracula's daughter, Lilith, helping her control her raging bloodlust while hunting vampires and other undead beings. The duo fought alongside the Ghost Rider against the Scarecrow. Back in New Orleans, Jericho united with the vampire hunter Blade to defeat an alliance between Marie Laveau and Deacon Frost, and Jericho turned the true Damballah against Laveau. Jericho's old friend Bambi Arbogast called Voodoo in to help revive Iron Fist, who had spent his life-force saving Luke Cage. Sensing a rift developing between the worlds of the living and the dead caused by the resurrection of Erik Killmonger, Jericho journeyed to the side of the Black Panther, sending Moon Knight into the Realm of the Dead to retrieve the Panther's spirit after he had been slain by Killmonger. This led Panther into conflict with Nightmare, but in the end, T'Challa was restored to life and Jericho returned home. By this time, Jericho had developed a sense of protectiveness about New Orleans, eagerly identifying himself as its local super hero. Jericho cautiously observed the plots involving the mystic Inficio Aquilus, the first tarot card deck, and later helped the X-Men's Gambit against the zombie army raised by Antoinelle Arcenaux. Jericho helped Gambit overcome his reluctance to fight a zombie version of an old friend, Dan Down, and later led Gambit in laying the zombies to rest. Brother Voodoo remains an active defender of not just New Orleans but of the entire world.",

      "biography": "Davey Fortunov grew up in Prohibition New York. By the early 1930s he had cultivated a reputation as the toughest and meanest guy on the lower East Side; however he remained a good man, using his rep on one occasion to spare young Steve Rogers from a pounding by local bullies. At some point he ratted out powerful mobster Olga Cimaglia to save his own neck; perhaps it was because of this that he relocated to California, Anglicizing his Jewish name to Dominic Fortune. Billing himself as a “Brigand-for-Hire”, he wore a distinctive “swashbuckler” suit, swiftly establishing a new reputation for himself. He set up home aboard the Mississippi Queen, a floating casino moored just outside U.S. waters; he enjoyed a romantic relationship with the Queen’s owner, Sabbath Raven, to whom he constantly owed several months back rent due to his incessant gambling in her casino, and with whom he shared numerous adventures. In 1937 Dominic learned his likeness was being used as the basis for Acme Publications’ Purple Slasher comic book character, and angrily returned to New York, accompanied by Sabbath, where he exposed the company as a front for Nazi propagandists. Deciding to do a little gambling at a place suggested by his friend, Acey Dugan, Dominic was arrested in a police raid, then offered his freedom by Commissioner Gardle in return for untangling Gardle’s naïve friend Zelda Pinkley from her mobster boyfriend Louise Kelt. Learning that Kelt and his minions were zombies, Dominic destroyed them before Kelt could marry Zelda. Dominic remained in New York after Acey arranged for him to become the new face advertising Ferdley’s Milk. When movie star Chisholm Smith, formerly a childhood friend of Dominic’s and now secretly a Nazi sympathizer, assisted Baron Strucker in an assassination attempt on outspoken anti-German Senator Foster, Dominic learned of the plot just in time to save Foster’s life. Hired to bodyguard child star Tina Timmons, Dominic learned Tina was really a midget with a facelift, plotting to trick Dominic into slaying her ex-husband Lancelot before he could expose her secret. On Christmas Eve 1937 Dominic prevented a Santa-suited kidnapper, also called Dominic, from abducting the British ambassador, Sir Reginald Fortesque, in spite of repeated interference by the vigilante Silhouette (Lamar Canfield), who had erroneously concluded that Fortune was the kidnapper.  Returning to the West Coast, in the spring of 1938 Dominic met circus owner Timothy “Dum Dum” Dugan. Having been pressed to sell his circus by thugs hired by the wealthy Spencer Keene, Dugan had deliberately taunted them by using the show as collateral in a game of chance aboard the Mississippi Queen, only to lose it to the house. Keene offered to buy it from Sabbath, but she refused. Keene wanted the circus mentalist, Cephallo, to mentally open a booby-trapped safe left to him by his father; unable to simply buy the circus, Keene stole Cephallo’s trailer, believing Cephallo to be inside. Instead he kidnapped Cephallo’s assistant, Glory, who turned out to be the real mentalist; however, before she could open the safe, Dugan and Dominic arrived to rescue her. Keene fled, but was swiftly apprehended by Dominic. A few months later Dominic was hired by Carol Einhorn to break into her husband’s coastal estate, Skycliff, and kidnap her ex-husband Jacob, so that she could retrieve the $250,000 he owed her in back alimony. Dominic penetrated Skycliff’s defenses to find Einhorn selling the U.S. out to the Japanese military in return for ruling Texas and Mexico after they invaded. Dominic blew Skycliff and the Japanese plotters to kingdom come, though not before stealing enough gemstones to cover Carol’s alimony. Towards the end of the year former silent movie star Noble Flagg began a crusade against sin; hired by Apex Pictures to find evidence to discredit Flagg, Dominic noted that Olga Cimaglia was Flagg’s partner. He learned Flagg had a weapon for creating earthquakes, which he intended to use to attack casinos, bordellos, opium dens and burlesque theaters, gathering followers to his crusade, but also bringing control of the L.A. underworld into Olga’s East Coast hands. As Flagg, who had double-crossed Olga, attempted to flee town, Dominic confronted him; Olga interrupted their brawl, but Flagg shot her dead then attempted to escape in a mini-helicopter. In his haste to evade Dominic, he forgot to open the building’s skylight first, and crashed into it explosively.War broke out in Europe, and Dominic and Sabbath found themselves increasingly battling Nazi spys and saboteurs, such as Baron Wolfgang von Lundt or the members of the Dean Brothers Circus. The latter incident made the newsreels, bringing Dominic to the attention of the U.S. Army’s Operation: Rebirth, which was looking for a candidate for Professor Erskine’s Super-Soldier Program. Dominic agreed to the experiments, but though weeks of tests proved him physically suitable, he was eventually rejected. One general raised concerns over choosing a Jewish candidate for the program, but his objection was disregarded; however the President raised concerns over Dominic’s  gambling, fighting dirty and sleeping with Sabbath out of wedlock, leading to Dominic being turned down because of his dubious character. Though Dominic was angered at the decision, when he chanced to witness Nazi agents trying to kill the next candidate, Steve Rogers, Dominic came to Rogers’ aid, and together they eventually overpowered the Nazis. A few months later, Dominic and Sabbath watched newsreels of Captain America in action, aware that this was the boy Dominic had once saved from neighborhood bullies.In May of 1940, Dominic and Sabbath were in Rotterdam. They had an argument, and Sabbath stormed out; later that day, the Nazis invaded the Netherlands, and Dominic was unable to locate Sabbath before being forced to evacuate. Dominic joined the army, and a few years later returned to Europe as a G.I. Numbed by witnessing friends and comrades die, after the war Dominic searched across Europe and America for Sabbath, at some point encountering Nazi hunter Ernst Sablinova. When creditors finally sold the Mississippi Queen, Dominic gave up and tried to get on with his life. Returning to being David Fortunov, he married, had a couple of children, and became a car salesman. After his wife died, he tried living with his son Jerry, but eventually Jerry moved him into Restwell Nursing Home in New York. David revived Dominic Fortune and alongside Spider-Man (Peter Parker), prevented Turner D. Century from slaying all New Yorkers under 65 with his ultrasonic Time Horn. Revitalized, Dominic began anew his search for Sabbath. His hunt soon drew the attention of Wolfgang von Lundt, now Simon Steele of Steele Enterprises. Unknown to Dominic, after losing track of him, Sabbath had worked as a resistance fighter alongside Wolfgang’s anti-Nazi brother, Heinrich, eventually marrying him after the war ended, and having his daughter Elena. When Heinrich was murdered, Wolfgang took them in, having bought immunity from war crime prosecutions by aiding the Allies prior to the war’s end; he forced Sabbath to marry him, and raised Elena in his own image. Fearing Dominic’s hunt would destroy his new life as Steele, he hired the Shocker to kill Fortune, but Spider-Man stopped him. Though Jerry threatened to commit him, Dominic ignored his son and followed a lead to California; Jerry followed, witnessing his father battle alongside Iron Man (Tony Stark) against the Iron Monger, one of Steele’s lackeys. Iron Monger struck Dominic with a repulsor blast; the injured man passed out in Jerry’s arms, and arriving doctors proclaimed him dead. Unaware the medics were in Steele’s pay, and his father, still alive, was now Steele’s captive, Jerry vowed to get vengeance, and became the new Dominic Fortune. Breaking into Steele’s estate, Jerry was reunited with his father; the pair attacked Steele’s stronghold alongside Iron Man, but Jerry was fatally wounded by Steele, and died in his father’s arms. Having met Elena, now the spitting image of her mother and calling herself Sabbath, while in Steele’s custody, Dominic renewed his determination to find Steele and Sabbath. With his immunity to prosecution gone due to his murder of Jerry, Steele began eliminating anyone who could testify as to his Nazi past; meanwhile Silver Sable’s Wild Pack picked up Steele’s trail, now that the Nazi was fair game. Dominic found Steele in residence aboard the aging Mississippi Queen in New York harbor, and was finally reunited with Sabbath. Steele and Elena were taken into custody with the assistance of Spider-Man and Silver Sable, and Sabbath and Dominic left to try and rebuild their relationship.Recently Silver Sable has encountered a youthful adventurer going by the Dominic Fortune name. Whether this is somehow David Fortunov rejuvenated, or another individual who has taken up the mantle, is, as yet, unconfirmed.",

      "biography": "The product of a Cold War era U.S. military experiment, Doop was instrumental in the fall of the Soviet Union. Little is known of Doop’s whereabouts between that period and his recent job as cameraman for the media-savvy, profit-driven mutant superteam X-Force, but at some point he befriended Wolverine and possibly became a priest. Doop's unique look and quirky personality made him arguably X-Force's most popular member, with Doop merchandise everywhere. One of the few X-Force members to survive the Boyz R Us massacre, Doop immediately took to the new team leader, Mister Sensitive. When former team manager the Coach betrayed U-Go Girl and Mister Sensitive, Doop convinced Wolverine to intervene on their behalf. Curiously, Doop was unaffected by Lacuna’s time-altering powers when she sought membership. Accidentally sending his teammates into his own psychedelic nightmare dimension after popping a zit, Doop entered it himself to rescue them, although no one remembered these events. After following U-Go Girl’s death, Mister Sensitive rechristened their group from \"X-Force\" to \"X-Statix\" at the opening of the Doop Children’s Hospital.During new membership tryouts, Doop discovered the applicant Corkscrew was suffering from Code-X, which made him dangerously unstable, and later killed him. When many believed Mister Sensitive had become the villainous Bad Guy, Doop defended him. Sent by Spike Freeman to see if Wolverine had Code-X and to deal with him if he did, Doop was unaware Wolverine was sent on a similar mission by Charles Xavier. The duo briefly fought before teaming up to rescue the mythical Pink Lady from her captor Hunter Joe, whose head was later mounted on Doop's wall. After photographs of El Guapo’s affairs leaked to the press, the furious teammate rightfully blamed Doop. During a dinner meeting, Doop viciously murdered an assassin sent to kill Henrietta Hunter. After Spike Freeman’s death, Doop was one of the team members sent to Russia to find a new financier for X-Statix.  Kidnapped by Russian terrorists, Doop’s brain exploded during a scuffle between X-Statix and the Avengers. The two teams battled each other in an attempt to reassemble Doop’s brain, until only one piece remained. Animated by the temporary backup brain in his butt, Doop battled Thor for the final piece of his brain. Finally recognizing X-Statix as heroes, the Avengers handed over the brain. X-Statix later resolved to break up following one final mission, during which every member, Doop included, apparently died. Doop's popularity endures despite his seeming demise, as evidenced by sales of \"Doop Lives\" t-shirts.It appears that Doop has recently returned to Earth from outer space, but it is unknown whether this creature, which Polaris identified as Daap, is a different being altogether or if Polaris simply misheard the complex series of clucks and barks that constitute the alien language as Daap instead of Doop. The truth may never be known.",

      "biography": "The Doppelganger began life as a living fractal, a geometric pattern in the Dimension of Manifestations, able to assume the forms and attributes of any being, real or abstract. When the mysterious Magus set out to obtain the vast power of the Infinity Gauntlet, he contracted the ruling fractal, Prime Manifester Anthropomorpho, to transform several young fractals into monstrous versions of Earth's super heroes; the Doppelganger was one such creation, based upon Spider-Man. It and its brethren were sent to Earth to attack the heroes in the so-called Infinity War. The Doppelganger interrupted a fight between Spider-Man and the Hobgoblin, who impaled the creature upon a fence. Following the battle, the Doppelganger was retrieved by the demonic Demogoblin, who unknowingly infused it with supernatural energy, enabling it to remain in the Earth dimension following the Magus' defeat. Demogoblin directed the Doppelganger in a grudge against Hobgoblin, whom the altruistic Spider-Man protected. The foursome's fight brought them to another battle, where the supernatural heroes Ghost Rider and Blaze were fighting a group of demonic Deathspawn and Spider-Man's murderous nemesis Venom. Both the Doppelganger and Demogoblin were subsequently pulled underground by the Deathspawn, with two Deathspawn briefly taking up silent residence within the Doppelganger's body.The disoriented Doppelganger wandered New York for days before being attacked by the psychotic Carnage, who mistook the creature for their mutual enemy Spider-Man; however, Carnage's companion, the equally insane Shriek, took a liking to the Doppelganger, and the deranged couple introduced their new \"son\" to the \"pleasure\" of random murder. During their spree, the three were joined by Demogoblin and Carrion (Malcolm McBride); they also fought Spider-Man, the Black Cat, Cloak and Dagger, Venom, Morbius, and others. The Doppelganger became devoted to Shriek; when Carnage attacked her for rebellious behavior, it sprang to her defense, but Carnage gutted it and kicked it to the street several stories below. Carnage and the others were defeated shortly afterward, but whether the Doppelganger was truly slain remains to be seen.",

      "biography": "DORMAMMUA maniacal, malevolent cosmic being with a diabolical desire to conquer and rule, Dormammu uses his extra-dimensional abilities to invade and attack realms and worlds across all planes of existence. With malicious minions always at his disposal, Dormammu remains a constant enemy of Earth and those—good or evil—who would defend it against galactic terrors. He lords over the Dark Dimension, forever plotting new ways to overtake our world, subjugate humanity, and augment his power.OMNIPOTENT ORIGINSThousands (or perhaps even millions) of years before Dormammu ever knew of Earth, or desired to rule it, he and his sister Umar were beings of energy known as Faltines. After killing off their progenitor Sinifer, Dormammu and Umar were driven from their home dimension. Assuming material forms, they explored the multi-verse before settling in the Dark Dimension—a mystical realm containing multiple realities magically merged into a single domain.At the time of their arrival, the Dark Dimension’s diverse denizens had been at peace for almost 28,000 years and the region was in the third millennium of the rule of King Olnar. Dormammu cunningly ingratiated himself to Olnar before, ultimately, dispatching the king and seizing control for himself. While ruling, Dormammu absorbed the Dark Dimension’s power and became a being of pure energy once more. As king, he made both allies and enemies and waged wars against realms while also creating pacts with others.After teaming with Odin of Asgard and the embodiment of Eternity to banish an occult juggernaut called Zom to a netherworld amphora, Dormammu turned his attention to Earth - participating in the creation of Earthly demon-lord Satannish. His plot, however, was thwarted by Agamotto, the first Sorcerer Supreme, using the immensely powerful Eye of Agamotto amulet and the mysterious Staff of One.After giving birth to Clea, Umar would go mad. Banishing his distressed sibling to a pocket dimension, Dormammu would take both Clea and her father Orini, King Olnar’s son, into his dark service.POWERS UNLEASHEDAs a Faltine, Dormammu is an immensely powerful mystical being capable of maintaining massive levels of magic. He is beatable but immortal, capable of dissipating his physical form and adopting one of pure energy.Among Dormammu’s vast abilities are energy projection, protective shields, time travel, teleportation, telepathy, soul manipulation, life-force absorption, dimensional portal creation, elemental control, and the creation of artificial beings. In fact, a rundown of things Dormammu CAN’T do might be the shorter list. With all the power at his command however, it is Dormammu’s arrogance and poorly controlled temperament that usually lead to his downfall rather than the overwhelming force of a superior sorcerer.Dormammu can call upon the mystical energies of the entire Dark Dimension, as well as his own innate power, however his abilities are somewhat limited when he’s physically present in another universe.COSMIC COHORTSDespite Dormammu’s insatiable thirst for conquest and domination, he is able to recognize allies and remain loyal to allegiances. He also, at one point, vowed to never attack Earth again after Dr. Strange helped save the Dark Dimension—recognizing that he was in debt to his arch-enemy. It’s a promise that he spends much time afterward trying to find a loophole around.Dormammu may have little tolerance for other living beings, but he still manages to operate under his own warped version of a personal code. Once, his sense of nobility even leads him to berate Baron Mordo for interfering during an arranged duel with Strange.Throughout his conquests however, Dormammu has been less interested in partnerships and more compelled to find beings to control and possess. Even his own sister was banished so that he could be the one ruler of the Dark Dimension. Dormammu considers himself superior to all other beings—even ones as powerful as Odin and Eternity, whom he once sided with.What Dormammu has in spades, of course, are minions; either those he has subjugated or beings he’s created. Baron Mordo, Ast the All-Seeing, the Mindless Ones, the Guardian, and the Unknown Knight have all obeyed Dormammu’s orders and been sent to pick off his foes.ETERNAL ENEMIESDormammu has clashed with many beings over the course of his existence, both cosmic and Earthly. It’s the Ancient One and his disciple, Doctor Strange, who have invoked the Dread One’s wrath the most however. Constantly repelling his attempts to overwhelm Earth, Strange easily overtook his mentor as Dormammu’s chief adversary after his numerous victories insulted Dormammu’s pride.Dormammu’s greatest enemies have always been those of a mystical and magical nature, but while in physical form he’s capable of holding his own against most any Super Hero, including the Hulk. Dormammu’s plots to invade and conquer Earth have brought him toe-to-toe with the likes of the Avengers, the Defenders, and the Guardians of the Galaxy.",

      "biography": "Around 18,500 B.C., an Atlantean cult used the legendary Chthon Scrolls to create the first vampire in order to oppose King Kull, who had slain the mighty wizard Thulsa Doom. Varnae quickly slaughtered or vampirized the remaining Darkholders, including Verdelet, spawning a race of vampires. A number of other races or sects exist, some spawning from the Varnaean line or other, unknown sources; among these are the Adze, Ancients, Charniputra, Huskies, Jumlin, Nosferatu, Purebloods, Tryks, and Yiki Onna. When Atlantis sank 500 years later, Varnae placed himself in suspended animation, reviving occasionally, battling such warriors as Conan, Red Sonja, and Zula circa 10,000 B.C. and controlling the bat-like Afterlings. Around 2000 B.C., Varnae coerced the Sumerian sorceress Aamshed into creating the Ritual of Ascendance which would exponentially amplify the vampire lord's power; however, Aamshed made the ritual only able to be performed every 2000 years and on the vampire's native soil. Twice failing to complete the Ritual, Varnae battled Thor and the Catholic Church's Montesi line - who held the Darkhold spell for vampire destruction - for centuries before tiring and seeking an heir.Dracula was born in A.D. 1430; in 1444 he accompanied his father and Radu to Turkey to discuss peace, but they were ambushed, and the sons were held prisoner by Sultan Murad II to force Vlad the Elder to favor Turkey. After five years of torture, Radu had died, and Vlad the Elder and Mircea were killed by Vlad's advisors, led by John Hunyadi, for supporting Turkey. At 18, Vlad escaped and returned home, taking the title of voivode (prince) of Wallachia, but fled after a year, fearing his father's killers. Returning in 1451, Vlad threw himself at the mercy of Hunyadi, who trained him in war. Following through with a prearranged marriage, Vlad wedded Zofia, whom he despised. After a year, his obligations fulfilled, Vlad ousted Zofia and their infant daughter, Lilith. Again becoming prince of Wallachia, Vlad married his beloved Maria, sired Vlad Tepulus, ordered the impalement of all involved in his father's death, slew the Teutonic Knight Frank von Frankenstein, and ordered a massed assault on Turkey. Receiving deceptive \"visions\" from Varnae in 1459, Vlad Dracula was defeated in battle, but the warlord Turac had him spared, hoping to use him to seize control of Transylvania. Dracula was taken to the Gypsy Lianda, secretly a vampire, who used her \"healing powers\" on him. Dracula revived, but realized his powers moments too late to save Maria from assault and murder by Turac, though Turac soon fell before him. Dracula passed Varnae's test by destroying the false vampire-lord Nimrod, and, after Varnae resurrected him from destruction by a group of priests, Dracula became the Lord of Vampires by consuming the blood of Varnae, who then destroyed himself.Dracula initially slaughtered many Gypsies, blaming them for his transformation. Dracula then reclaimed his Castle and slew the vampire Bordia, learning of the Montesi Formula. He sent the thief Murgo to steal the Darkhold from the Vatican, but the book was stolen by the sorcerer Cagliostro, beginning their long feud. Transforming several women into his Brides, Dracula avenged himself on Murad II. After fighting off an assassin in 1471, Dracula abdicated his rule, though he remained in his castle for over a century. Eventually he was forced to slay Vlad Tepulus, who had been raised by Gypsies who had taught him to hate and to kill his father. In the 16th century, Dracula encountered Esteban De Ablo and twice battled Puritan adventurer Solomon Kane; a man named Durenyi stole Dracula's diary, which revealed his weaknesses and would eventually be read by 19th-century writer Bram Stoker. Dracula left his Castle near Snagov, moving to one near Burgo Pass, which he would keep for four centuries.In 1606, Dracula encountered the Blood Countess, Elizabeth Bathory, whose practice of bathing in virgin blood allowed her to resist and nearly entrap him, but he exposed her activities and slew her. Dracula ruled a Spanish province until being driven out in the first of many encounters with the mysterious Golden Angel. In 1691, tired of his wanton Brides, he sought out the American woman Charity Brown in Salem, Massachusetts. When she was framed as a witch and slain before his arrival, Dracula manipulated the slave Tituba into precipitating the Witch Trials. Around the same time, unable to pierce the anti-vampire defenses of a Swiss village, Dracula fed on a cow, Bessie, who would follow Dracula's trail for centuries. In the 18th century, pirate Hellyn deVill raided Castle Dracula; Dracula exposed her as a witch, and her crew slew her. Dracula fled Castle Dracula in 1762 due to the combined threats of Turks and Catherine the Great's Russia, relocating to France, where he renewed his enmity with Cagliostro after destroying his agent Jacques DuBois' animated gargoyle. In 1775, Dracula became advisor to King Louis XVI and then vampirized Cagliostro's wife, Lorena Serafina, surmising that the sorcerer no longer held the Darkhold. In 1789, Dracula narrowly survived destruction by Cagliostro's agent Montplier, escaping during the storming of the Bastille. Leaving France, Dracula vampirized Austrian Henry Sayge then attempted to dominate Transylvanian Baron (Grigori) Russoff, vampirizing his wife, Louisa, but he was staked and destroyed by Russoff. Upon reviving, Dracula retook his Castle and created defenses, such as his Pit of Death, though in 1809 it failed to stop Lupescu, who sought vengeance for his vampirized wife Velanna and slaughtered Dracula's Brides, arranging their bodies into a giant cross. Also in that century, Dracula vampirized the wife of Count Vryslaw, who maintained her on animal and then human blood for twenty years before ending their existence; using his Children of Judas vampire cult to vampirize the wife of Abraham van Helsing, renewing his ancestral feud; vampirized Lyza Strang after her betrayal following his assistance in making Otto von Bismarck leader of the German States; fell in love with Anabelle St. John, using his Legion of the Damned vampires in 1862 to assist the Confederate army in exchange for her returning to Transylvania with him; occupied Vienna via his vampire-legions before being driven off by the Golden Angel; vampirized pirate Captain Cutlass; dated the royal Maria Kroner in 1879; and was destroyed by an American Marshal with silver buckshot. Though he was later resurrected, minute silver particles temporarily weakened Dracula, causing him to age rapidly when he went without blood. In 1890, Dracula fought Jonathan Harker, Abraham van Helsing, John Seward, and others, escaping death by turning into mist. Dracula was later staked by van Helsing, but revived with the unwitting aid of Frankenstein's monster in 1898.In the early 20th century, Dracula battled a manifestation of Death, vampirized John Falsworth (Baron Blood), slew Jon Harker, defeated mobster Nick Diablo in Rome, met Marianne Cutlass (daughter of the pirate captain), battled the Frenchman in Marsailles, and encountered the demonic Devil's Heart in North Carolina. During World War II, Dracula opposed the Nazis as they destroyed his Gypsy servants; he destroyed Hauptmann Rudolph Kris after he usurped Castle Dracula, and at least once worked with the Howling Commandos. In the latter 20th century, Dracula's exploits were more frequently recorded, and his many adventures included vampirizing Tartoff on whose family he had preyed for generations; seeking the powers of the demons Ypsilloth and Ryg beneath Tarrington's Jenning Mill; fighting Father Vergilius Flotsky in Brass Monkey, New Mexico; observing the destruction of the Immortal Nine's Pool of Blood; battling the young Blade and his vampire hunters in China; solving the mystery of Mortus the Death Man who sought vengeance on the Broadway Project for her father's death; failing to control vampirized CIA pilot Roberta Christianson, and failing to claim the powerful Yazdi Gem from Augustus Ebers. Eventually the vampire-hunter the Scotsman staked Dracula and knocked him into his own Pit of Death. Despite his body's destruction, Dracula's spirit sent his agent Comte St. Germaine to obtain the Amulet of Zarathos in a failed effort to resurrect him.A few years later, Dracula's descendant Frank Drake inherited Castle Dracula, but his witless friend Clifton Graves removed the Scotsman's stake, restoring Dracula. Drake joined a band of Vampire-Hunters that continually pursued and sometimes even temporarily destroyed Dracula, who traveled to America and then back and across Europe, encountering the likes of Duncan Corley's restless corpse, the Werewolf Jack Russell, the Elderspawn Y'Garon and Elianne Turac (the life-extended daughter of the Turkish warlord), and making a new Castle Dracula from Castle Dunwick, usurped from Sheila Witter. Somehow entering the Vatican despite great agony, Dracula slew Giuseppe Montesi, but not before Montesi had sent a copy of the Formula to Quincy Harker. A disembodied brain who needed human blood to survive and sought vampire servants to obtain it for him, Doctor Sun drained Dracula's power and had him destroyed; but to stop Sun, the vampire-hunters used Aurora Rabinowitz's virgin tears to revive Dracula, who helped Blade temporarily destroy Dr. Sun. Dracula then infiltrated Anton Lupeski's Church of Satan, posing as the devil and seeking to sire a human son. Lupeski saw through the farce but hoped to control the child, and he presided over Dracula's wedding to Domini and the mystic ceremony through which Dracula fathered Janus. Lupeski attempted to kill Dracula, but inadvertently slew Janus instead, and Dracula crushed his skull. Domini magically revived Janus, who merged with the Golden Angel and fought Dracula repeatedly. As punishment for bringing Janus into the world, Mephisto (as Satan) stripped Dracula of his powers, though he became amused and restored them when Dracula became so desperate that he prayed to God for help. Dracula reclaimed the title of Vampire-Lord from the usurper Torgo, but was soon after skewered by a silver spoke in a battle with Quincy Harker, who also perished, destroying the most recent Castle Dracula in the process.Shortly thereafter, Florence Ebers revived Dracula, seeking to resurrect Augustus in Dracula's body via the Yazdi Gem, but she destroyed the Gem when Augustus turned against her. Dracula encountered the satanic Cult of the Enclave and the life-draining Dimensional Man. Dracula's spirit and strength briefly drained into the young Jacque McDonald after she received a transfusion from her mother, whom Dracula had bitten years earlier. Dracula later bit Howard the Duck, which left a bad taste in his mouth and sent the Duck on a brief bite-frenzy, then vampirized former associate Harold H. Harold. The Defenders aided Dracula against usurper vampire-lord Gordski, who was backed by Puishannt of the Six-Fingered Hand. After twice failing to fully vampirize Storm of the X-Men, Dracula was backed by the magic of the Darkholders, increasing his power, and he fought Thor before being utterly destroyed, along with the rest of the vampires on Earth, when Dr. Strange recited the Montesi Formula; however, Strange's cryogenic suspension of his own vampire brother Victor years before weakened the mighty spell, which was completely broken when Marie Laveau used the Vampiric Verses spell to resurrect Varnae.Sometime later, a demon named Asmodeus orchestrated Dracula's resurrection. Confused over the absence of Dracula's remains from his castle (where they lay when Asmodeus last observed the Earth), Asmodeus located the vampire's soul, then replaced the soul and the restored remains at the site of his previous death, again skewered by Quincy Harker's silver spoke. Dracula was revived by Professor Gregor Smirnoff, accessing the power of Asmodeus. Through Smirnoff, Dracula tapped the psychic power of 666 students associated with the Belonging cult. He was opposed by Frank Drake, Blade, Katinka, and Inspector Judiah Golem. After being wounded by his enemies, Dracula was eventually overcome by the spirits of the dead passing though him and he exploded. A later explosion apparently merged Frank Drake and vampire Hannibal King into a new, monstrous Dracula who fought Blade, but the real Dracula's spirit eventually possessed this monster, displacing Drake and King and restoring all three to their original forms. Dracula created an artificial companion in Raynee, but Spider-Man and Dr. Strange drove him from her. Dracula was then infected with a vampire-destroying virus by Charles Seward (descendant of John), which made it impossible to consume human blood, but also turned out to be lethal and highly infectious to humans. Dracula ultimately cured himself by drinking Seward's blood, which had been used in developing the virus. Dracula encountered the mutants of Generation X, then was forced to work with Elsa Bloodstone, whose father he had fought in the past, to oppose the Nosferatu vampires, who sought to infect other \"purebred\" vampires with an Ebola-like virus, making them immortal blood donors. From within his Transylvanian castle, Dracula prepared himself for the Ritual of Ascendance. Weakened during the incubation period, Dracula surrounded himself with armies of vampires from across the world, including Varnaean vampires, as well as the Adze, Charniputra, and Yiki Onna. Succeeding despite a new batch of Vampire-Hunters, Dracula immobilized Blade and completed the Ritual, assuming immense size and power. Dracula claimed Vampire-Hunter Divinity Drake as his bride, but she then revealed her true identity: Aamshed, the Sumerian sorceress who had created the Ritual millennia ago. Having created a supernatural lodestone to attract the souls of those slain by vampires over the last two thousand years, Aamshed unleashed those souls on Dracula, their purity setting him on fire. Whether needed or not, Blade then leapt forward, plunging a stake into Dracula's chest. As the vampire lord was consumed by the souls, the residual energy spread throughout the castle and the surrounding countryside, consuming the vampires there as well.",

      "biography": "POWERS\n\n\nLike all Eternals, Druig is normally immortal and invulnerable, and it would take the dispersal of most of his atoms to permanently slay him; currently his body is human and somewhat weakened, but if he is killed he will be reborn fully Eternal once more. While possessing all his species’ superhuman attributes, he has specialized in “changing,” manipulating reality. Superhumanly strong (Class 25), he can also fly, often preferring to do so on fire or earth platforms generated out of the air; teleport; telepathically sense someone’s psychological vulnerabilities or control their minds; and project energy from his hands or eyes, most commonly flame.\n\nORIGIN\n \n\nOne of the virtually immortal Eternals, results of prehistoric Celestial genetic experiments on primitive man, Druig has sought personal power at the expense of others for millennia, often thwarted by his cousin Ikaris. Around 18,000 BC, Druig helped his fellow Eternals battle the Deviants, who had conquered much of Earth before turning on the Eternals; though his fellow Eternals disliked Druig, they recognized his lethal skills, seemingly the only one of them who enjoyed slaughtering Deviants. The war ended when the Deviants attacked the arriving Celestials’ Second Host, who triggered the Great Cataclysm that sank the Deviant homeland of Lemuria beneath the ocean as punishment for the Deviants’ transgression. Through the following years the Eternals would visit primitive human civilizations, though Druig did not assist their development as the other Eternals did, and they became mistaken for gods. Around 1000 years ago Druig, Valkin, Ajak and Virako visited Peru and prevented the mind-controlled Asgardian god Thor Odinson from freeing the imprisoned Deviant Dromedan; coveting Dromedan’s immense powers for himself, Druig created a Neutralizer helmet to control him, but instead fell under Dromedan’s thrall. Druig’s allies subsequently recaptured Dromedan, unaware of Druig’s part in his escape.\n\nBy modern times, when the Celestials’ Fourth Host arrived on Earth, Druig had become a KGB agent. Druig plotted to slay the Celestial Ziran the Tester with an ancient weapon the Celestials once used to destroy one of their own; he tortured fellow Eternals Sigmar and Ikaris to learn its hidden location, but before he could fire it at Ziran, Ikaris disintegrated Druig. His life force was trapped in the Celestial prison, the Desecration Annex, though a fight between Captain Marvel (Genis- Vell) and the warden, Godstalker, nearly released it accidentally. More recently, the Eternal Sprite used the Dreaming Celestial’s power to change the world, transforming all the Eternals into humans with false identities and memories. Druig was reborn as deputy prime minister of Vorozheika, a former Soviet Republic. Though unaware of his true origins, his personality remained the same, and he planned to kidnap top foreign scientists for his country. Druig arranged for a celebrity party at the New York Vorozheikan embassy, ostensibly to raise Vorozheika’s international profile, while his assistant Prikrysh organized a “terrorist” raid to abduct the invited scientists; however, elements within Druig’s own Prosperity Party, concerned he was an old regime liability, ordered Prikrysh to have Druig killed during the attack. The party coincidentally brought together other amnesiac Eternals, Sersi, Thena and Makkari, and their proximity combined with the stress of being held hostage triggered the partial recovery of their powers and, gradually, memories. Realizing he had been betrayed, Druig slipped away while his gunmen were being&nbsp;overpowered and returned to Vorozheika, swiftly effecting a coup and purging his enemies. Shortly after, Druig assisted Zuras and Ajak trying to prevent the Dreaming Celestial awakening, on condition that his fellow Eternals did nothing in the future to interfere with him or his country. Despite the Celestial awakening, the crisis was averted; after assisting his fellow Eternals against a Deviant army threatening Olympia, Druig used Vorozheikan intelligence to track down other Eternals still trapped in human form before Ikaris’ faction could. Ikaris and Thena tried to stop him snatching Legba, but Druig endangered Thena’s mortal child Joey to distract them, escaping with his prize.",

When the Class' instructor, Xorn, was manipulated into believing he was Magneto, Sooraya joined the X-Men in opposing him. Later, when the student body was organized into squads, Sooraya was placed with the rebellious Hellions. Seemingly out of place with her respect for tradition and strong moral code, Sooraya still did her best to work with her teammates.

The last wish of her father was that Fisk raise the child well, a wish the Kingpin honored, caring for her as if she was his own. Believed to be mentally handicapped, Maya was sent to an expensive school for people with learning disabilities. There, she managed to completely replicate a song on the piano. After that, she was sent to another expensive school for prodigies. She grew into a gifted and talented woman. Upon visiting her father's grave with Fisk, she asked how he died. Fisk told her that Daredevil had killed him.Maya was sent by the Kingpin to Matt Murdock to prove Matt's weakness. He told her that Matt believed he was a bad person, and that she was the only way to prove him wrong. (As Maya believed him, it would not appear to be a lie when she told Matt.)Matt Murdock and Maya soon fell in love. She later took on the guise of Echo, hunting Daredevil down. Having watched videos of Bullseye and Daredevil fighting, she proved more than a match for Daredevil. She took him down and nearly killed him, refusing only when she found out Matt and Daredevil were one and the same. Matt managed to correct the Kingpin's lies. In revenge, Echo confronted Fisk and shot him in the face, blinding him and starting the chain of events that would lead to his eventual downfall. (Kingpin would later partially recover his eyesight through reconstructive eye surgery).After realizing the horror of her actions and the lies she has grown up with, Maya fled the United States to do some soul-searching. When she came back, she tried reuniting with Matt Murdock, only to find out he was now with a blind woman named Milla Donovan, and that the Kingpin was still alive (despite Maya's attempts to kill him). Leaving Matt, Maya visited the Kingpin in prison, who told her that he didn't blame her for what she did, and that despite all that had happened, he still loved her like a daughter.Unsatisfied and needing peace, Maya turned to the Chief, her father's old friend, noted for his wisdom. The Chief sent Maya on a Vision Quest to calm her soul. On her quest, she met and befriended Wolverine who helped her recover and may be attributed to her picking up Japanese values and knowledge of the Japanese underworld. Soon enough, Echo made peace with her past and was back doing performance art. Recently, after being unable to join the Avengers for personal reasons, Daredevil recommended Maya to Captain America to help the Avengers seize the Silver Samurai in Japan. She donned a suit that concealed her identity as well as her gender and rechristened herself as Ronin. Maya was instrumental in helping the Avengers defeat Hydra, the Hand, and Madame Hydra after a pitched battle.Ronin then returned to Japan to keep an eye on Elektra Natchios and focus on resolving the conflict between the Hand and Clan Yashida.",

      "biography": "Maxwell Dillon has been one of Spider-Man's most frequent and enduring adversaries, often fighting alongside some of the more powerful masterminds in the web-head's rogues gallery, rather than creating intricate plots of his own. Raised by his overprotective mother, after his father abandoned them, Max had ambitions of being an electrical engineer. However, after being convinced by his mother that he was not smart enough to pursue such a career, Max instead reluctantly took a job as a lineman for an electric company. While repairing a power line still connected to its spool, Max was struck by lightning. Instead of being killed, the freak accident caused a mutagenic change in his nervous system, allowing him to generate and control vast amounts of electricity. After creating a colorful costume, Max turned to a life of crime as Electro.At the beginning of Electro's criminal career, J.Jonah Jameson began a smear campaign in the Daily Bugle proclaiming Electro to actually be an alter-ego for Spider-man. Intent on proving the publisher wrong, Spider-man faced Electro and was nearly killed by merely touching him. Using a fire hose, however, the web-slinger was able to defeat Electro. Sometime later in another attempt to deface Spider-man's reputation, Jameson secured Electro's supercharged services to battle the web-slinger on national television. Before an audience of millions, Spider-Man stood triumphant once more. Dillon was humiliated.After a string of embarrassing defeats, decided to test his strength in numbers as a member of the Sinister Six, alongside Doctor Octopus, Kraven the Hunter, Sandman, Mysterio and the Vulture. Drawing numbers, the plan was for each villain to face Spider-man in a different location that drew upon their respective talents one by one until one of them was victorious. However, they were eventually defeated and imprisoned.In an attempt to win himself the glory and respect that had alluded him so frequently, Dillon tried to devise a master plan to control New York City's power supply. However, he was once again defeated by Spider-man and convinced to quit his criminal career...if only temporarily. He resurfaced as a member of the next incarnation of the Sinister Six, with Hobgoblin replacing the deceased Kraven the Hunter. Doctor Octopus betrayed the group and they were subsequently disbanded. Electro was also a member of Mysterio's Sinister Seven, created to combat Spider-Man's insane, homicidal clone, Kaine. However, Kaine disappeared and with no further need to keep the group together, it was disbanded and Dillon returned to his self imposed exile  He was once again brought out of retirement by the Rose, who offered Dillon the chance at an experimental procedure to greatly enhance his abilities in exchange for his services as an underworld enforcer. Dillon and agreed, sensing the opportunity to rise above his past failures. After undergoing the procedure and dispatching several members of the True Believers, an offshoot of the Hand at the request of the Rose, Dillon returned to his original plan of taking over the New York City power supply. Once again defeated by Spider-Man, who had donned an insulated suit, a frustrated Dillon threw himself into the Hudson River, apparently killing himself. \n\nHowever, Dillon survived as he reappeared as part of the next series of subsequent incarnations of the Sinister Six, each of which were either defeated or disbanded due to internal conflicts. The most recent incarnation, the Sinister Twelve, gathered by the Green Goblin as part of a larger plan to enable his escape from prison and destroy Spider-Man. They were defeated with the help of the combined efforts of Captain America, Iron Man, Daredevil, Yellowjacket and the Fantastic Four.Electro was hired by Brainchild to free Karl Lykos from the Raft, a maximum-security prison designed to hold supervillians. Electro initiated a prison break the likes of which had never been seen, releasing scores of criminals. However, his actions also brought together a number of the world's most powerful heroes to contain the disaster including: Captain America, Iron Man, Luke Cage, Spider-Woman, Matt Murdock, Sentry and Spider-Man, many of whom were trapped in the Raft when the power was shut off. With the exception of Daredevil (and Sentry at first), this impromptu gathering of heroes reunited shortly after the prison break to form a new Avengers team. Dillon tried to escape with his girlfriend, a waitress in Boston, but was captured by the new Avengers, the very team he inadvertently helped create.",

      "biography": "Driven by pain and hatred, prone to violence, and trained in the martial arts and the ancient ways of the ninja, Elektra Natchios has killed her way to the upper echelons of the world’s deadliest assassins—and not even her own death has stood in the way.\n\nDaughter of Darkness\n\nElektra Natchios was born in tragedy, as her mother was shot while pregnant and died shortly after giving birth to the girl. Elektra was raised by her father, Greek ambassador Hugo Natchios. As a young child, Elektra became a dedicated student of the martial arts, beginning to acquire the skills that would serve her years later in her chosen profession.\n\nBy her late teens, Elektra was living in the United States with her father, and attending Columbia University. There, she met and fell in love with fellow student Matt Murdock, who would later become the costumed crimefighter, Daredevil. The couple found that they shared a thirst for danger and adventure. Because of her father’s overprotectiveness, Elektra and Matt met in secret, which only fueled their passions. But Elektra was plagued by dark voices that drove her to violence, which she contained only by acting out against criminals whom she felt deserved punishment.\n\nAfter Elektra and Matt had been dating for a year, she and her father were taken hostage on campus. Matt, in disguise, defeated their captors with Elektra’s help, but a police officer mistook Hugo Natchios for one of the terrorists and shot him dead. Unable to bear the pain of losing her father, and fearing that she would be overwhelmed by her own aggressive urges, Elektra fled, leaving Matt heartbroken.\n\nElektra hoped to join the Chaste, a clan of warriors led by the blind martial-arts master Stick, who had advised her in the past. But Stick recognized the pain and hatred that still burned within her. To preserve the group’s purity, he forced Elektra to leave the Chaste. Determined to prove her worthiness, Elektra planned to infiltrate the Hand—the ninja cult that had been at war with the Chaste for many years—and defeat them from within. The Hand proposed a test, tricking Elektra into killing her former sensei. Her already fragile psyche was shattered. The Hand exploited this vulnerable state of mind and trained her to become one of their greatest weapons. But they could not bring her over to their side completely. Elektra broke free of the Hand’s control, but was forever tainted by the group’s sinister touch. She then became an assassin-for-hire, selling her lethal services to the highest bidder.",

      "biography": "Elektra Natchios began studying martial arts under Master Stone when she was six, soon after her mother died from breast cancer. After finishing school, she attended Columbia University where she dated blind classmate Matt Murdock. When Elektra's friend Mel was raped by a boy called Trey, the charges were dropped thanks to Trey's influential father. After Elektra threatened Trey, his hired thugs firebombed her father's dry cleaning business. Matt forced the thugs to confess, but again Trey was freed, and Elektra began to fear Matt was lying to her since she suspected he was not truly blind.After Trey attacked Mel again, Elektra ambushed him, planning to kill him. Trying to stop her, Matt showed he trusted her by sharing his secret: though he was blind, his other senses were superhumanly enhanced. Unmoved, Elektra cut Trey's femoral artery and gave Matt a choice: save Trey from bleeding to death or be with her. Matt chose the former.Elektra quit school and moved back in with her father, whose cousins Paul and Leander paid to rebuild his business but then used the store for money laundering. Elektra agreed to settle her father's debts by stealing the ledger of their bookkeeper Cullen, who was about to testify against the cousins. She found the ledger, but Cullen was slain by the professional assassin Poindexter, who then tried to kill her. Elektra escaped, but Poindexter framed Elektra's father for Cullen's murder.Seeking to clear him, Elektra teamed with Matt and learned that Poindexter was hired by the Kingpin, who also sought the ledger. The duo failed to prevent Poindexter from killing Cullen's lawyer, William Savage, who had another copy of the book, but Poindexter failed to retrieve the ledger. Sucker-punching Matt, Elektra traded the ledger to the Kingpin for Poindexter and clearing her father. She fought Poindexter and won, impressing the Kingpin, who offered to employ her. Later, Matt revealed there had been evidence that would have cleared her father without Kingpin's aid.Elektra became a freelance assassin, though Spider-Man stopped her from killing a Latverian General. The Kingpin hired her to retrieve a stolen stone tablet, bringing her into conflict with the Black Cat and Spider-Man; when the Cat threw the tablet into the river, Elektra impaled her on a throw sai, seemingly killing her. Recently, Elektra has started working for the Kingpin again, after Hammerhead began a gang war challenging his rule of the underworld.Hammerhead's attempt to extort money from a Kingpin-owned restaurant in Chinatown brought Shang-Chi and Danny Rand into the mob struggle. As if that weren't enough, the Black Cat arrived on the scene, tracking down Hammerhead to look for help in her war against the Kingpin. Along with Elektra, all of the players have assembled in Hammerhead's penthouse. Just as Spider-Man thought he had the upper hand, Elektra made her move and smashed him through the window, taking him out of the fight. However, Moon Knight injured the assassin at the last minute with a nasty cut behind her head. Ironically, she was then thrown out the same window Spider-Man came out of.",

      "biography": "Emma Frost was born into a wealthy old Boston mercantile family that arrived from England in the 1600s. The second of three daughters, Emma also had an older brother named Christian who had turned to substance abuse as an escape from the drudgery of his life. Unknown to their family or themselves, the three Frost sisters were mutants whose telepathic abilities matured upon reaching puberty.\n\nWhen it came time for their father to choose a worthy heir to the family fortune, Christian was automatically dismissed due to his drug problem. Whilst the older sister Adrienne seemed the most obvious choice, the father chose Emma. Surprisingly, she refused, choosing to make her own way through life.\n\nEmma ultimately inherited a good deal of wealth, but most of her large fortune resulted from her professional success. She ascended rapidly to the upper echelon of the business world on the strength of her intelligence, drive, and personal charm, as well as the secret use of her mental powers. Also, at some point, the Dark Beast met Emma, and helped her rise to wealth and power.\n\nEventually, Emma became majority stockholder of a multi-billion dollar conglomerate principally involved in electronics and transportation - both the building of ships and aircraft, and their use for freight and passenger conveyance. Despite her relative youth, she was named chairwoman of the board and chief executive officer of the rechristened Frost International. She also became headmistress and chairwoman of the board of trustees of the Massachusetts Academy - a college preparatory school for students in grades seven through twelve located in the Berkshire Mountains in Snow Valley, Massachusetts.\n\nEmma's success caught the attention of the Hellfire Club, an elite social organization consisting of the world's wealthiest and most powerful figures. When she learned that the club was hiring dancers, she promptly auditioned and used her telepathic talents to enhance her performance in their eyes. Unlike the other females in the Club, Emma was never uncomfortable with the strict dress code that required female members to wear lingerie at all times. She believed her revealing wardrobe to be one of many weapons in her arsenal, one that gave her an instant advantage over men.\n\nFrost quickly became an ally of Sebastian Shaw, a member of the club's Council of the Chosen who were secretly conspiring to achieve world domination through economic and political means. At the time, the leaders of the club and council - its foremost Lords Cardinal, whose titles corresponded to the names of chess pieces - were White King Edward Buckman and White Queen Paris Seville.\n\nBuckman threw the council's support behind Project: Armageddon, scientist Steven Lang's program to construct mutant-hunting Sentinel robots. Aware of Shaw's genetic disposition, Buckman told him the initiative's intent was to capture mutants as a means of helping the council attain power. Using her psionic powers, Emma learned that the project's actual purpose was the annihilation of all genetic deviants. After Shaw's lover, Lourdes Chantel, was murdered by one of the Sentinels, Shaw and Frost staged a coup that saw them seize control of the Council of the Chosen, which they renamed the Inner Circle. Shaw took the title of Black King, and Frost became the new White Queen.\n\nUnder Shaw and Frost's leadership, mutants dominated the Inner Circle. To strengthen the Club's power base, Emma recruited genetically gifted youngsters and helped them hone their abilities at her school. Most of these students were members of the Hellions, Emma's first mutant super-team. She initially encountered the outlaw band of heroic mutant adventurers known as the X-Men when she unsuccessfully attempted to recruit young Kitty Pryde, the phase-shifting mutant then known as Shadowcat. Subsequently, Emma crossed paths with the X-Men - and their protégés, the New Mutants - on a number of occasions, often as their adversary. Later, the X-Men joined with the Hellions to protect the White Queen from the time-traveling terrorist named Trevor Fitzroy. However, the madman's brutal assault plunged Emma into a deep coma and brought about the Hellions' untimely demise.\n\nWhilst Emma's consciousness still active on the material plane, her body was kept in the med-lab at the X-Men's mansion. Seeking to ensure her students' welfare and the school's future, Emma had willed responsibility for the Massachusetts Academy to Professor Charles Xavier, the X-Men's telepathic founder. During her psychic incapacitation, the school was added to the rapidly expanding Xavier Institute. While Emma’s corporeal form was in stasis, a short-circuit in the mansion inadvertently caused her psyche to possess the X-Man named Iceman, whilst his mind was transferred into her body.\n\nCoerced by Professor X, Emma eventually reclaimed her own form. After making a full recovery, she resumed her role as headmistress of the academy. Ably assisted by Sean Cassidy, the sonically empowered former X-Man known as Banshee, she set out to train a new crop of young mutants: Generation X. When the sinking stock market dealt Frost International a major blow, Emma swallowed her pride and sought the help of her older sister, Adrienne, who agreed to support her sibling's flagging financial interests only if she were named co-headmaster. But Adrienne's power play did not wind down when Emma acceded to her request, nor did it end when she supplanted her sister as the Hellfire Club's White Queen. Only after Adrienne telepathically incited a riot at the school did Emma find a way to upset her ascension: the way of the gun. Emma shot and killed her sister, thereby laying claim to Adrienne's inheritance.\n\nFollowing the dissolution of Generation X and the closure of the Massachusetts Academy, Emma moved to the island nation of Genosha where she began teaching mutant children again. Soon after, a Sentinel attack wiped out Genosha's entire mutant population. Emma was found by the X-Men alive in the rubble, having undergone a secondary mutagenic change that allowed her to survive the onslaught. Following this incident, Emma came to teach at the Xavier Institute, and soon took on the responsibility of personally mentoring the telepathic quintuplets known as the Stepford Cuckoos.\n\nEmma later counseled her teammate Cyclops following his possession by the eternal mutant warlord Apocalypse. This soon turned into a telepathic affair between the two which was short-lived after Summers' wife, Jean Grey, discovered what was happening.\n\nDuring the riot at the Xavier Institute, Sophie of the telepathic sisters the Stepford Cuckoos died. The remaining sisters blamed Emma for this and told Jean Grey-Summers of Emma's affair with her husband. When Emma was confronted by Jean, she was forced to relive various moments of her past. Following this confrontation, Emma was shot with a diamond bullet whilst in her diamond form, shattering it. Though she was believed to be dead at first, Emma's consciousness was trapped in her shattered remains. Phoenix discovered this and telekinetically fused Emma's body back together. Upon being reassembled, Emma identified Esme of the Cuckoos as the culprit behind her assassination. However, Esme was working with the X-Man Xorn, who believed himself to be Magneto at the time, and it was he who shot Emma as she had learned of his dual identity.\n\nFollowing the death of Jean Grey, Emma has assumed the position of co-headmaster of the Xavier Institute alongside Cyclops.\n\nWhen a band of Shi'ar reconstituted the Phoenix Force in order to destroy it, they ended up shattering it and driving it insane. It went to earth and forcefully resurrected Jean Grey, believing it needed Scott Summers when what it needed was the energy from his optic blasts. Emma attempted to shield Scott with her mind, but was stopped by Quentin Quire, who sought to use the Phoenix Force to resurrect Sophie of the Cuckoos. Emma offered herself as a host for the Phoenix Force so it could be contained but was quickly overpowered and her body was completely taken over by the Force. After temporarily resurrecting Sophie, who rejected Quentin, the Phoenix proceeded to burn the planet. Jean Grey separated Emma and remerged with the Force, only to fall into insanity. Emma used her powers to contact every X-Man in the world and their love for Jean restored the Phoenix's sanity, who became the White Phoenix and returned to the White Hot Room to find her missing pieces.",

      "biography": "Marius St. Croix grew up living a pampered life with his family in the small European principality of Monaco. When his mutant nature manifested, Marius’ mother became the first victim of his need to feed on genetic material to survive. Seeking more power, Marius studied dark magic, eventually inviting his sister Monet to join him in his efforts to rule the world. After she scornfully rejected him, an irate Marius magically trapped her in the form of a red-skinned mute creature dubbed “Penance.” Believing he had killed Monet, Marius’ younger twin sisters used their own powers to banish him to another dimension, but were unable to prevent Penance from following him. After years of imprisonment, Marius—now calling himself Emplate—eventually learned to traverse the dimensional barrier and returned to Earth, where he employed the dwarven D.O.A. as a manservant.Learning of the powerful mutant Chamber, Emplate intercepted him upon his arrival in the U.S., but was driven off by the Generation X students. Among their number were Marius’ younger sisters, who had used their powers to merge into M, a single being resembling Monet. After Penance escaped and joined Generation X, Emplate sought to recapture her and so enslaved several mutants, as well as Chamber’s former girlfriend, Lady Gayle Edgerton. Emplate and his “Hellions” attacked and captured Generation X, but were defeated thanks to the X-Man Bishop, who noted that hordes of Emplate-like creatures existed in his future time. Before his defeat, Emplate enslaved Generation X member Synch and sent him to attack his own family; however, Synch ultimately fought off Emplate’s influence. Later, Emplate and the twins were temporarily fused into a new being named M-Plate, who allied with the superhuman bounty hunter Chimera in an attempt to gain control of the Universal Amalgamator, a device that could merge all sentient beings in the universe into a single consciousness. Their plan was thwarted by Generation X, and Emplate and the twins were all separated by the mutant Dirt Nap. While merged with their brother, the twins learned of Monet’s true fate, and subsequently used their powers to merge with Penance and free her, becoming Penance in her stead.A weakened Emplate later returned and attacked Generation X, but was defeated by a massive explosion generated by Jubilee which also forced the twins out of their Penance form, creating a third Penance whose identity remains unknown but is suspected of being related to the St. Croix siblings. Emplate was subsequently held within the Academy’s infirmary until the school was all but destroyed during a riot, during which Emplate presumably escaped.",

      "biography": "The Enchantress' parentage is unknown, though it is known she has a sister by the name of Lorelei. In time, Amora became one of the more powerful magic-wielders in Asgard, with her magical arsenal focused on (but not limited to) charming and mind-controlling people. Her by now well renowned beauty did not hinder in this.Amora has devoted her immortal life to the pursuit of power and pleasure, using sorcery and sexuality as her tools. Born into the Asgardian gods, Amora studied under the mighty sorceress Karnilla The Norn Queen, who ultimately expelled her for being too undisciplined. Amora went on to study under many other Asgardian mages, often seducing them to learn their secrets. By the time she reached adulthood, Amora was a powerful sorceress, famous for her beauty and infamous for her heartless scheming. An early alliance with the warrior goddess Brunnhilde the Valkyrie ended with Amora trapping Brunnhilde's soul, using the Valkyrie's vacated form as a shell for herself and various pawns to inhabit over the centuries that followed. Brunnhilde would eventually return, becoming one of Amora's bitterest enemies. Amora's longest-serving pawn was Skurge the Executioner. Skurge was madly in love with Amora, who granted him just enough affection to ensure his loyalty. The two pursued many schemes together, often coming into conflict with the thunder god Thor and his mortal comrades, the Avengers. When Skurge eventually sacrificed his life aiding Thor in an heroic rescue mission, Amora mourned him with a genuine grief that surprised everyone, including the Enchantress herself. Other smitten pawns such as the original Power Man (Erik Josten) and a new, human Executioner (Brute Benhurst) never served the Enchantress quite so well as Skurge, and were soon abandoned. Pardoned in recent years after helping defend Asgard against Surtur, Amora has had an on-and-off romantic link with her longtime foe Thor, to whom she was drawn even more strongly after he inherited the throne of Asgard. As Thor's ally, advisor and sometime lover, Amora has been a prominent figure in Thor's Asgard. Sadly, Amora was among the many Asgardians apparently slain when Thor's brother Loki led a revolt in fulfillment of the Ragnarok prophecies. Whether she will rise again remains to be seen.",

      "image": "https://terrigen-cdn-dev.marvel.com/content/prod/1x/eternitystand.jpg",
      "biography": "Eternity came into existence when the universe was formed (along with Death, Oblivion, and Infinity) and spontaneously assumed the collective consciousness of all living things in the Universe. He is every living thing and every living thing is him; thus he controls everything in all plains of existence with the exception of the Living Tribunal, who maintains the cosmic balance of power. Eternity is the physical incarnation of time, whereas his sister Infinity represents space. Also, if Galactus ever dies or does not exist, the opposite of Eternity, Abraxas, would come into being. Eternity is guarded by Captain Universe.The origin and precise nature of the abstract being known as Eternity are unknown and unknowable. It is the sum total of collective consciousness of all living things in the universe, the embodiment of their life as Death is the embodiment of the ending of that life.Unlike Death, which Eternity refers to as its sibling, Eternity does not often take an active hand in the dealings of the trillions of lives that make up its total. However, since controlling the being Eternity allows the controller to wield Eternity's unlimited Powers over the beings that make it up, this entity is a target for extra-dimensional attackers of various abilities. Usually Eternity can deflect such attacks without significant exertion, but on occasion has had to bring its own servants into play. While not as organized as the \"death-gods\" that serve Death, these servants are usually powerful individuals, such as Doctor Strange, who may combat the attackers on their own mortal levels. These servants have a vested interest in seeing Eternity survive intact, as Eternity makes their very existence possible.Such was the case when the powerful extra-dimensional being known as Nightmare attempted to seize Eternity from the inside, using all sleeping sentient beings (usually one-third of the total lifeforms in the universe and therefore a powerful minority of Eternity) to drive Eternity to sleep, thereby putting Eternity under Nightmare's control. In this state, Eternity was induced to dream planet Earth's obliteration. Doctor Strange, who possessed the Gift of Extended Life, did not die, and journeyed to Nightmare's realm, there to free Eternity and persuade him to recreate Earth. As Eternity is the sum total of all living forces, destruction of Eternity may eradicate the universe, and with it all other quasi-physical entities. Death and Eternity exist as partners, not competitors, and Death has never shown and \"rivalry\" (at least until the Infinity Gauntlet, one such event that comes to mind) against its \"sibling.\" Eternity, for its part, has rarely shown any interest in the pieces that make it up, though if given sufficient threat (on the level of the Beyonder, for example) would willingly sacrifice part of its infinite existence (and the planets, stars, and lifeforms that make up that existence) to foil such a foe.Also, there is the time when Eternity appeared to testify on the behalf of Mister Fantastic, when he was abducted by a group of survivors of Galactus' feedings. Eternity testified that Reed acted out of compassion, and not out of malice, in reviving Galactus. Saying that Galactus does indeed play a part in the universe, the accusers were satisfied, and Reed was released. Other events include Eternity's involvement with the Infinity Gauntlet affair.",

      "biography": "The enigmatic Ezekiel appeared seemingly out of nowhere, bearing an intimate knowledge of Peter Parker’s powers and history. Ezekiel possessed strikingly similar abilities to those of Spider-Man, although he had used them to a very different end, having built a powerful business empire with international reach. Peter was curious to discover more about Ezekiel’s past, but instead it was Ezekiel who asked the questions, suggesting to Peter that perhaps the random accident which gave him his powers was not so random and causing Peter to examine more deeply his relationship with the world of spiders from which his gifts came.In return, Ezekiel indicated he wished simply to use his knowledge and resources to aid Peter, as Peter had aided others. This aid was soon given, when the creature named Morlun came seeking to devour Spider-Man’s totemistic powers. Soon after, Ezekiel came again to Spider-Man’s aid when Shathra the Spider-Wasp came hunting from astral plane looking to devour her natural enemy. Barely surviving these battles, Spider-Man never sought to question who might have been the true target of these attacks.To understand more about Ezekiel, it is necessary to hear the story of Kwaku Anansi, inhabitant of Ghana in West Africa, centuries ago. Anansi sought wisdom, but also followed the way of the spider, climbing high on web and line. Anansi climbed high enough to speak to Nyame, the sky-god, and entreat with him for wisdom of the mortal world and the world beyond. Nyame demanded eternal servitude. Anansi agreed, but warned that he could never turn away from those in need and those he loved and revered. The bargain was struck and the spirit of Anansi passed down over generations to individuals with the spirit of the hunter, but who also honored Anansi’s higher ideals.Several years ago, the young Ezekiel learned of Anansi’s line. Using his wealth to save a Spider-Temple in Peru from planned demolition, Ezekiel demanded that the head priest Miguel should perform the blood-rite and grant the Spider’s powers to him. Miguel warned that the true heir of this generation was yet to arrive and furthermore, that the spirits of the temple would one day learn of the deception and would not be pleased. Ezekiel insisted. He always planned to first gain more power, in order to help those in need. Instead, the search for “enough” power consumed him, and he never found the moment to act.When Ezekiel learned of the pending arrival of Morlun and later Shathra, he knew that they were coming for him. He sought out Spider-Man and under cover of “protecting” Peter, guided Spider-Man into unwittingly fighting on his behalf. Learning of the arrival of “The Gatekeeper” and his horde of spiders, Ezekiel saw this foretold the coming of the guardian he had long feared and no such simple deception would suffice.Through treachery, Ezekiel subdued Spider-Man and brought him to Peru. A corrupted form of the blood ritual merged his blood with Peter’s and Ezekiel then abandoned Peter to be punished in his place. Unexpectedly, the exchange worked in the both directions and Ezekiel realized the good that Peter had done in comparison to how he himself had squandered his gifts. Racing back, Ezekiel sacrificed himself to the demonic spider that sought him, leaving Peter to mourn the man with whom he had so much in common and yet so little.",

      "biography": "Tryco Slatterus, formerly the Champion of the Universe, is one of the Elders of the Universe-individuals who are the sole survivors of their races, date to the earliest days of the cosmos, and have spent their lives dedicated to one focus, In the Champion's case, this focus was personal competition. Accompanied by fight promoters and trainers, for millennia the Champion traveled the cosmos and defeated the best fighters of each world in hand-to-hand combat, always stopping the battles short of death. Proja, his Promoter Supreme, preceded the Champion of Earth and recruited eight of Earth's strongest male heroes (Champion having decided eons earlier that females were inferior and not worth fighting). Champion then forced their participation by threatening to destroy the planet should they not fight him-those unworthy of the glorious gift that is the true spirit of competition would be \"purified\". The eight combatants accompanied Champion to his extra dimensional training facility, but only six ultimately fought him in a force-field protected Madison Square Garden: Thor, Hulk, Sasquatch, Colossus, Wonder Man, and the Thing. The Champion defeated or disqualified the first five within one round each, and then proceeded to brutalize the Thing, who refused to fall. Battered and bloodied, the Thing battled on for three rounds, until the Champion called the fight and claimed the victory. However, the Thing's persistence and refusal to accept defeat earned him the Champion's respect, and the Champion departed for his next bouts, telling the Thing that he would consider for him the supreme honor: a rematch. The Champion subsequently conspired with fellow Elders Astronomer, Collector, Contemplator (actually a Skrull imposter), Gardener, Grandmaster, Obliterator, Possessor, Runner, Trader and their ally Ego to vanquish the few beings older than them. The Elders claimed that their ultimate goal was to obliterate the entire universe, with themselves re-emerging in the new universe that would follow as the oldest beings in creation, each possessing as much power in that universe as Galactus currently did in theirs.. The Champion traveled to Earth to defeat the Silver Surfer, whom the elders saw as a threat, but the Surfer beat Champion by using the power cosmic instead of hand-to-hand combat. The Champion then claimed that he had come only to prevent the Surfer from interfering in a Skrull attempt at cosmic domination-the Skrulls had captured Galactus' then herald Nova (Frankie Raye) and were using her to blackmail Galactus into devouring worlds of their choice; access to this information allowed the Surfer to deduce a method to free himself from his imprisonment on Earth. Retrieved by his fellow Elders after this defeat, the Champion observed as the Grandmaster manipulated Earth's Avengers as part of a wager with Death, winning Death's permanent refusal of all the Elders into its realm as his prize. Champion then battled Mantis and the Surfer when they learned of and opposed the Elder's plans. The Champion soon traveled to Grinx and defeated the planet's ablest combatants, claiming as his prize their world-trophy, an Infinity Gem. The other Elders gathered the remaining Infinity Gems and created a solar system spanning Infinity matrix which allowed them to draw out the energy of its sun and six planets and use that to drain Galactus's life force. The Surfer and Nova interfered by exploding the system's sun, disrupting the Elder's scheme, and Galactus consumed Champion, Collector, Gardener, Grandmaster, and Runner. Unable to die, the Elders survived inside Galactus, weakening him from within. When the Astronomer, Trader and Possessor allied with the In-Betweener to attempt to retrieve the five trapped Elders, the foursome attacked and defeated Galactus. Wanting Galactus dead (as part of a struggle against his own superiors, Master Order and Lord Chaos), the In-Betweener betrayed the three free Elders, confining them to Oblivion (disguised as Death by the In-Betweener). However, the Silver Surfer, Nova, Mr. Fantastic, and the Invisible Woman opposed the In-Betweener, saved Galactus. And inadvertently allowed the Elders trapped within Galactus, including Champion, to escape. Now free, the Elders each claimed an Infinity Gem, with the Champion taking the Infinity Gem of Power. They observed the battle which ensued between the In-Betweener and Galactus, intervening to see the In-Betweener banished back to the care of his masters as punishment in his role in condemning their three fellow Elders. When Galactus proved victorious, the Elders fled before the specter of his anger after their earlier attempt to kill him. Believing the Gem to be dormant and not wanting to attract the notice of Galactus, Death or Eternity, the Champion returned to his competitions. The Mad Titan Thanos found Slatterus on Tamarata, where the suddenly bloodthirsty Champion was engaging in mass battles instead of one-on-one fights, leaving many opponents dead on the field. Thanos tricked Slatterus into destroying the planet, and then offered to teleport the marooned Champion to another world in exchange for the \"dormant\" Power Gem, a bargain he gladly accepted. Quickly conquering the simple dwellers on this new planet, the Champion obtained the foremost mystical artifacts of that world (wristlets which were apparently adaptations of the Quantum Bands), and then exterminated the planet's population before departing in search of both the Power Gem and revenge against its \"thief\". Champion eventually located the mad Titan, but when Thanos dismissively teleported Slatterus to a lifeless world, the Champion destroyed it in anger. Through the machinations of Mephisto (who was manipulating the Silver Surfer), the Champion soon learned that Thanos no longer held the Power Gem, and it was now in the hands of Drax the Destroyer. Slatterus attempted to head for Earth to find Drax but was opposed by the Surfer; Mephisto transported Drax to the field of battle and the Champion was defeated by the Silver Surfer and the Gem-powered Drax. The Surfer claimed and then destroyed the Champion's wristlets once he was defeated. The Power Gem passed through a number of hands (and universes) before the Champion finally recovered it and resumed his practice of seeking opponents. He settled in on planet Skardon, a planet where leadership was determined in hand-to-hand combat, and quickly became the planet's ruler. He then began running the planet into the ground, spreading word that he'd make the Skard suffer until a worthy challenger to his rule arose. Adam Warlock, who had experienced psychological difficulties himself while wielding the vampiric Soul Gem (another of the Infinity Gems), learned of the Champion's instability and used his Soul Gem to defeat Champion, but Skardon law did not allow them to acknowledge the out-of-ring defeat. While the Skardons aided the Champion in restoring himself after the defeat. Warlock sought opponents to defeat him within the ring. The Champion defeated the Shi'ar Gladiator, the Silver Surfer, Beta Ray Bill, Drax the Destroyer, and Adam Warlock himself before the Magistrati (agents of the Living Tribunal's universal law) sent a court-appointed advocate, the She-Hulk, to Skardon to oppose Champion at the request of Warlock's companion, Pip the Troll. Skardon law required Champion to accept even the challenge of a \"lesser\" female, and She-Hulk was losing badly to Champion when she asked for an appeal and was granted an extension. She trained for three months on the theory that her human form of Jennifer Walters was weak, and by increasing her human strength, she'd exponentially increase her strength as She-Hulk. She then returned and objected to the Champion's use of the Power Gem, an alien object which should not be permissible within the ring according to Skardon law. The Champion, already irritated over the lengthy delay, angrily conceded the point and fought She-Hulk without it, and the pair even extended a bitter wager: if the Champion lost, he'd never wear the Gem again, and if the She-Hulk lost, she'd bear the Champion children for him to raise as future combatants. However, the Champion had apparently become dependent upon the Gem; that the She-Hulk's newly acquired bulk led to a quick defeat for the former Champion, reputedly his first ever defeat within the ring. He took the name \"Fallen One\" and chose to provide the new \"Champion of the Universe\" with worthy competition (and perhaps a little punishment as well). Seeking out Zoma, a Watcher wishing vengeance on the She-Hulk on behalf of a banished friend, the Fallen One learned from him of She-Hulk's most ardent foe, Titania (Mary \"Skeeter\" MacPherren) and gifted her with the Power Gem he'd agreed to surrender. The Fallen One trained Titania for several weeks in the American southwest until his new pupil, fearing Slatterus might take back the gem, dropped a small butte on him, burying him.",

      "biography": "The product of a mating between his mother and a machine, Charlie-Cluster 7 was born in the World, a secret square mile of experimental micro-reality built by the military industrial complex. In the World, artificially evolved super-soldiers destined to serve mankind during the inevitable war between humans and mutants were bred and trained by the Weapon Plus Program. The World’s scientists heated up time itself until it flowed in all directions at once. Into this pliant, fast-moving substance, they introduced human test groups, whose genetic material was crudely spliced with adaptive Nano-Sentinel technology, and ran the result through half a million years of cyborg mutation in eighteen months. Charlie’s nervous system was extracted and mutated into the autonomous entity named E.V.A. The thirteenth of the Program's living “Weapons,” which counted among their earlier numbers the star-spangled Avenger Captain America as the first and the mutant hero Wolverine as the tenth, Fantomex was to serve together with Huntsman (Weapon XII), Ultimaton (Weapon XV), and others in the Super-Sentinels, a group of highly efficient mutant-hunters posing as a group of super-heroes modeled after Saturday morning cartoons.Fantomex, however, had other plans. When Weapon Plus simulated a train crash in the Channel Tunnel linking Great Britain and France to field their two latest super-soldiers, Huntsman and Fantomex, against a group of trained mutants, Fantomex seized the opportunity to escape. Pursued by the authorities, Fantomex fled to the Paris branch of the X-Corporation, the global mutant search and rescue organization, where he met its founder, Professor Charles Xavier, and Jean Grey-Summers, then acting headmistress of the Xavier Institute. Assuming a faux-French accent and falsely claiming to be Europe’s most notorious mutant criminal, Fantomex demanded sanctuary. Concerned for the safety of the X-Corporation squad that had gone to investigate the crash, and learning that Fantomex knew of its cargo, the trio escaped in E.V.A., who had taken on a flying saucer-like shape. Fantomex subsequently revealed the existence of Weapon Plus and offered to sell Xavier more information, but only if he agreed to help stop Huntsman. Arriving back at the Tunnel, Fantomex fought his way through the army that Huntsman had assembled. He shot many that had been possessed by Huntsman’s viral mind, including X-Corporation member Darkstar. On reaching the train, Fantomex located the pod which had housed Huntsman and activated a remote detonator, killing Huntsman instantly. Discovering a second pod, Jean realized that Fantomex was actually Weapon XIII, but still allowed him to escape.Fantomex later encountered the feral mutant Wolverine in a mutant slave trader camp in Afghanistan. Fantomex had gone there to steal a list of the richest people in the world who were engaged in the trade, intending to use it as blackmail. He also found the young Afghani mutant Dust lying unconscious after she had unwittingly slaughtered her captors. Turning her over to Wolverine, Fantomex left him to deal with the encroaching mercenaries. A short time later, Fantomex contacted Wolverine and offered him information about his past in return for aid in stopping Ultimaton. Along with Wolverine’s X-Men teammate Cyclops, the trio infiltrated the World to find time frozen and the facility decimated following an attack by the terrorist group A.I.M. After time began moving again, the heroes fought through the World’s defenses and confronted Ultimaton. They failed to defeat him, and he broke out of the World, escaping to Weapon Plus’ orbital station. Following in E.V.A., Fantomex intended to destroy the station, but before doing so he kept his promise to Wolverine by opening the complete Weapon Plus database, giving him access to the secrets of his past that had been long withheld from him by Weapon X. Sickened by what he learned, Wolverine triggered the detonation sequence and blew up the station. Fantomex and Cyclops barely managed to escape in a shuttle, and after killing Ultimaton, Wolverine was rescued by Jean. Returning to Earth to find the X-Men scattered and Manhattan under siege by a mutant impersonating their arch-foe Magneto, Cyclops recruited Fantomex, E.V.A., and a group of Xavier Institute students into an ad-hoc X-Men team to oppose the villain. Fantomex led the assault, cutting a path through the faux-Magneto’s Brotherhood and liberating Xavier, precipitating the villain’s downfall.Resuming his crusade against Weapon Plus, Fantomex found the grave of the Program’s director, John Sublime, but found it empty, except for a slip of paper bearing the word “Roanoke.” He located the secret facility of the splinter program Weapon X and found it abandoned except for Weapon X’s Agent Zero. After a brief scuffle with no clear victor, the pair reluctantly joined forces and traveled to the site of Roanoke, a town whose inhabitants were slaughtered after Weapon X unleashed a brainwashed Wolverine on them years earlier. There, they encountered Sublime but were opposed by his U-Men and forced to flee against overwhelming odds. Believed to still be under the Program’s control, Fantomex was left for dead. Later, Fantomex was contacted by the diminutive mutant Shortpack who sought his help in assassinating mutant arms dealer Steinbeck in revenge for his killing of an agent under Shortpack’s care. Fantomex refused, not wanting to become responsible for allowing the good-natured Shortpack to become a killer. Shortpack was captured by Steinbeck soon after, and whilst investigating his disappearance the shapechanging mutant Mystique, who was working for both Xavier and Steinbeck’s ally Shepard, learned of his meeting with Fantomex. Though despising him after a past encounter in Madagascar, Mystique found Fantomex in Monte Carlo, once again operating under the pretense he was a mutant thief, and learned of Shortpack’s plan. As she left to rescue him, Fantomex followed and uncovered her intent to assassinate Xavier. In exchange for his silence, Fantomex bade Mystique perform a heist for him. After she returned with the goods, Mystique infected both Fantomex and E.V.A. with a techno-organic virus, seemingly killing them both to keep her plan secret. However, it was all a ruse as Mystique knew she was being monitored by Shepard. Fantomex later resurfaced and helped Mystique capture Shepard, giving her access to Steinbeck whom she defeated.Fantomex Later returned to The World and with the aid of Wolverine and Noh-Varr sucseeded in shrinking it and stealing it.",

      "biography": "When J. Jonah Jameson first hired Peter Parker,he was very keen to learn how Peter took such amazing photographs of Spider-Man. He hired private investigator Mac Gargan to follow Peter around all day so he could find his answers. However Jameson’s attention was soon swayed when he saw an article about a scientist claiming to find a way to cause artificial mutations in animals. At first considering it to be the work of a crack-pot, Jameson soon became interested when he thought how this might benefit him getting rid of Spider-Man. When Gargan next came to Jameson to report on Parker’s activities, Jameson told him of the new scheme he had planned. Rushing immediately to Dr. Stillwell’s lab, Jameson told the ambitious scientist that he would pay $10, 000 if he could perform his experiment on a human, in this case Mac Gargan. At first reluctant, Dr. Stillwell couldn’t say no to such a donation and proceeded with the experiment. He decided to give Gargan the powers of a scorpion but wasn’t sure of the side-effects that this would have on his brain. Nevertheless, Gargan drank the serum and proceeded with the rest of the experiment. Dr. Stillwell also created a scorpion suit equipped with a powerful electro-mechanical tail. Gargan’s transformation was now complete. However shortly after the experiment, Dr. Stillwell continued to do further tests and discovered that the experiment was not such a success. As Gargan increased in strength, he would eventually lose his sanity. Dr. Stillwell fashioned a serum that would cure his experimental subject of his powers and proceeded to find Gargan, who was busy battling Spider-Man. Arriving on the scene,  Dr. Stillwell told Gargan of the side-effects of the experiment and told him about the cure. However, Gargan didn’t want to lose his power and climbed up the side of a building to get away. Dr. Stillwell proceeded to follow him but had lost his grip. As he fell, Dr. Stillwell threw the serum at Gargan in a vain hope to cure him. He missed and fell to his death.",

      "biography": "Maria Callasantos and her three siblings, Lucia, Matteo, and Carolina, grew up poor and abandoned by their father. One of Maria's only joys was in keeping the pigeons on their rooftops as pets. When her youngest sister, Carolina, was found dead from falling down a staircase, Lucia always wondered if Maria had pushed her, since Maria hated Carolina, blaming her for their father's desertion. Later, when their mother's boyfriend, Harry Bellinger, tried to rape Lucia, Maria's power emerged in anger, and she killed him. Nevertheless, her mother was furious, killing Maria's pigeons in return, and Maria, again in anger, killed her mother. There was no place for Lucia and Maria now-- no place but the streets. With Lucia's own mutant powers emerging, the two found refuge with the underground Morlocks. Calling herself Feral, she refused to join Masque's army of Morlocks, fleeing to the X-Mansion. She agreed to join the New Mutants in return for their help in taking down Masque, and the team soon after became X-Force. Feral served a long tenure with X-Force, joining them on all their early adventures, including one that brought her into conflict with Lucia (now, Thornn) when Masque's Morlocks teamed up with the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. However, Feral's naturally ferocious nature brought her into conflict with her teammates on many occasions, most notably the time she nearly eviscerated Cannonball during a training exercise.At one point, X-Force came into conflict with the Mutant Liberation Front (MLF), a terrorist organization that had kidnapped the government official and anti-mutant activist Henry Peter Gyrich. The MLF's leader, Reignfire, convinced Feral to switch allegiances, playing up to her hatred of Gyrich and what he represented. Feral attacked Gyrich, but was stopped by Cable, and she escaped with the MLF.Feral reappeared to confront her sister when she was captured by New York City police. Cannonball was also present and he and Lucia managed to reveal Feral's murder of Harry Bellinger and her mother. Although Feral tried to fight her way out, she was defeated and arrested.During her time in prison, Feral discovered that she had contracted the mutant-killing Legacy Virus. She escaped from prison and joined other Legacy Virus victims who were focused on finding a cure. Feral attempted to forcibly steal the High Evolutionary's Isotope E, which was believed a possible vaccine. They were stopped by the guardians of the Evolutionary's base, the Knights of Wundagore, and apparently disbanded. (More recently, a cure for the virus was discovered and released into the air, presumably ending the threat of the virus forever.)Feral later reappeared as a member of the New Hellions, led by the mutant known as King Bedlam. X-Force confronted the New Hellions on behalf of one of their new members, Jesse Bedlam, and during the confrontation, Feral seriously wounded X-Force member Siryn by slashing her vocal cords, an injury that left Siryn powerless and requiring a long recovery. When she next appeared, Feral and her sister Thornn were both working on behalf of Charles Xavier's X-Corporation offices operating out of Mumbai, India.Maria has since falled victim to the events of House of M|M-Day and has been stripped of her mutant powers. However, more recently, Maria and her sister had their feline appearances restored, although their powers remained suppressed. While in her cat-like-form the villain Sabretooth brutally attacked Maria. Her injuries resulted in her death. Recently, Feral was revived with an alien techno organic virus.",

      "biography": "Feron is the last descendant of the original Feron, who remained on Earth 616 to wait for the return of the Phoenix Force. He was raised by an order of monks in the county of Sligo, in Ireland, training his mind to host the Phoenix Force in order to defeat the Anti-Phoenix. The monks kept Feron shielded from the outside world, to keep his mind and intentions pure, and he was forbidden to touch the ground. When the foretold moment arrived, Feron's feet were allowed to touch the ground, calling the Phoenix Force to him, but the Force did not reply his calling. The Anti-Phoenix was released, without Feron to stop it, and merged with Necrom. The monks thought it would be best for Feron to join Excalibur and help them against Necrom. After the defeat of the villain, he remained with the team.Alongside Excalibur, Feron rarely used his powers or fought, remaining behind in Braddock Manor, though he helped against the Troll Associates and followed the team to the future of Earth 811, Rachel's home reality. As they returned from the mission, Captain Britain was lost in the timestream. This severely affected his lover, Meggan, who entered a fugue state, remaining unmoving in a waterfall. Feeling the empath's pain, Feron attempted to contact and help her, but he was overwhelmed by her pain and turned into water himself, loosing his corporeal form for a time.Some time later he was able to regain his body at last, and his first thought was of revenge against Excalibur, because they had forgotten about him. The Crazy Gang had lost one of their members, the Executioner. Feron stole the Executioner's robe and pretended to be him. Assuming leadership of the team, he led them against Excalibur, crashing Brian Braddock's bachelor party. His plan failed, but he was soon forgiven and invited to the wedding afterwards, which took place in Otherworld. Whether Feron returned to Earth or stayed in Otherworld remains to be seen.",

      "biography": "A devout Catholic social worker of Mexican ancestry, Bonita Juarez was wandering her beloved desert outside Albuquerque when a fiery meteor struck mere feet away from her. Miraculously unharmed, Bonita discovered she now had supernatural power over flame, which she used days later to foil a convenience store robbery. Described as \"Pajaro Del Fuego\" by one of the robbers, Juarez took the costumed alias Firebird and protected the American Southwest, both alone and as a member of the short-lived Rangers team. Later, after she was attacked by the demonic Master Pandemonium, Bonita tracked and fought him alongside the new West Coast Avengers roster. Eager to join their ranks, Bonita aided them against other foes such as the Werewolf and the Cat People, but team leader Hawkeye passed over her in favor of the Thing. Firebird's subsequent attempt to revive the Rangers was a failure (though she did succeed in exposing the demonic possession of her old teammate Shooting Star), and she soon left on a spiritual retreat. Returning in a more overtly religious guise as Espirita, Bonita helped a depressed Hank Pym rebuild his life, sharing a brief romance with him. She also helped rescue the West Coast Avengers from Dominus' time travel trap, using a message from Hawkeye entrusted to her family over two hundred years earlier. She later met SHIELD (the Society of Higher Interstellar Education and Logistical Development), a group of alien scholars who claimed the meteor that empowered her was waste material from one of their failed experiments. Bonita accepted the revelation as a lesson in humility, comforting herself with the belief that God might still be the author of her powers, albeit more indirectly than she had first imagined. Resuming her original alias as Firebird, she returned to her career as a social worker and became an Avengers reservist, aiding the team against various foes such as the Awesome Android, the Acts of Vengeance conspiracy, Atlantean invaders, SURF, Morgan Le Fay, and Dominex, and helping monitor the captured Bloodwraith and an alien invasion of Madripoor. She has declined several offers of full-time Avengers membership as she is devoted to her church work, but she did temporarily join the active roster for the duration of the Kang Dynasty war, helping liberate Earth and successfully counseling a disillusioned Thor.During the Civil War Firebird registered with the SHRA but following the news of Goliath’s death traveled to New York and joined the \"Secret Avengers\".

      "biography": "Firelord was sent to Earth, by his master, Galactus, in order to seek out two individuals – the mighty Thor and his companion Hercules. Weary after a battle with the deadly Destroyer, Thor transformed himself back to his human form of Dr. Donald Blake in order to check on a patient he was caring for. While at the hospital, Firelord sensed his targets and proceeded to procure them. Injuring some of the staff, Firelord did not go unnoticed by the Prince of Power, and Firelord’s arrogance gave Hercules the wrong impression about his intentions. The two did battle, but the awesome powers of Firelord were too much for the Olympian to handle, and even the added might of Thor could not prevent Firelord from summoning his master. Galactus eventually, arrived on Earth, not to destroy it, but to enlist the aid of the Thunder god against the now insane Ego, the Living Planet, in order to save the universe. Firelord, Thor and Hercules traveled to Ego and touched down on its surface where an incredible battle ensued. The heroes prevailed only when Galactus attached a powerful propulsion unit to Ego’s surface and blasted him into deep space. Soon after, Firelord asked to be a free man once again, and Galactus released him from his service when Thor offered up the Destroyer as a replacement herald.Firelord decided to remain on Earth for some reason that eluded him, and during his time he had encounters with beings such as Jean Grey and the Avengers. Firelord has also fought beside and against Thor on more than one occasion too. One such instance was sparked because of a televised battle between Thor and another former herald of Galactus, Air-Walker. Seeing the familiar face of his friend in distress ignited the rage within Firelord and he quickly flew to his aid. However, he arrived too late and his long lost companion was dead at Thor’s feet. The fury inside Firelord had nowhere to go, so he directed it at the Asgardian. The battle was fierce and brutal until Firelord told of his past and what Gabriel, the Air-Walker, meant to him. His tale ended with his confrontation with Galactus and his demands of releasing Gabriel from servitude. Galactus was so impressed with the audacity of this stranger that he offered him the opportunity to become herald, and Firelord was born. After he calmed down considerably, Firelord took the remains of Air-Walker, returned to space and buried him on an asteroid near their homeworld. Eventually, Firelord returned to Earth, and in an attempt to enjoy earthly pleasures, his arrogance got in the way again. He was attacked by several construction workers, and the commotion drew the attention of Spider-Man. Unfamiliar with Firelord, Spider-Man attacked but was quickly put on the defensive once the former herald of Galactus had enough. In the end, after pursuing Spider-Man throughout Queens and into Manhattan, Spider-Man managed to defeat Firelord just by running on pure adrenaline from his fear of being demolished. Firelord ultimately recovered and had other meetings with Earth’s heroes like Quasar before returning to space and starting a brief romance with another herald of Galactus, Nova. This could be one of the reasons why he chose to aid Nova and the Silver Surfer, along with the other former Heralds of Galactus, against the deranged Morg. That conflict ended with Morg’s defeat and Nova’s death, but Firelord, and the newly resurrected Air-Walker, agreed to act as heralds once again. Time had passed, and Firelord was released from service but was called back into action when the forces of Annihilus destroyed his homeworld of Xandar in an attempt to draw him and Air-Walker out into the open. The plot worked, but the Annihilus got more than he bargained for because Firelord would not go down easy. In fact, with Red Shift and Stardust at his side, he didn’t go down at all. After the Annihilation Wave was defeated, Firelord sought revenge for the destruction of the Xandar Cluster and hunted down the remaining forces of Annihilus known as the Centurions. Although his hatred for the Centurions is strong, Firelord allowed a small group that claimed to change their ways to survive, but warned that if they did not do right, they would die by his hand. firelord makes his next in marvel zombies 2 were him,thanos,ironman,gaintman,luke cage, spiderman,the hulk,wolverine,gladiator,and the phoenix.were theywith the power of cosmic ate the whole universe and are forced to go back to earth were a all out zombie.vs.zombie civil war",

      "biography": "Angelica Jones manifested her mutant microwave energy powers at the age of thirteen, a trauma made worse by the death of her beloved grandmother, Nana. Nana's passing left Angelica alone with her father Bart, who loved her but had great difficulty coping with Angelica's mutant nature. Relief arrived in the form of Emma Frost, headmistress of the prestigious Massachusetts Academy, which recruited Angelica and provided special training for her mutant powers. The naive young girl came to regard Emma as a sort of surrogate mother, but \"kindly Miss Frost\" was secretly the White Queen of the Hellfire Club, a high-society group covertly devoted to world domination. Frost's students included a mutant team known as the Hellions, but Angelica was trained largely in isolation, the better for Frost to manipulate her. Frost hoped to groom Angelica (code-named Firestar) as an assassin; but the plan fell apart when Angelica's bodyguard, Randall Chase, sacrificed his life to expose Frost's treachery. Heartbroken, a furious Firestar quit the Academy. Angelica moved back home, determined to live a normal life - until Night Thrasher uncovered her secret identity and pressured her into helping him found the New Warriors. As a mainstay of that super-youth group, Firestar grew into a formidable albeit reluctant champion, and she forged a lasting romance with fellow Warrior Justice, eventually following him to the legendary Avengers super-team he had long idolized. Shortly before joining the Avengers, Angelica had discovered that the microwave radiation she manipulated was threatening to render her sterile. This problem was solved by Hank Pym, who created a special suit to siphon off Firestar's excess radiation. Free from one of her greatest fears, Firestar resumed her adventures with renewed zeal. For a time, Firestar and Justice infiltrated he Triune Understanding spiritual movement at the behest of Avengers founder Iron Man. After the Triune's corrupt leadership was exposed and neutralized, the couple helped the Avengers thwart Kang's attempted conquest of Earth, then opted for Avengers reserve status to devote more time to their personal lives.Firestar recently made some decisions regarding both her personal and super-heroic life. First, she decided to end her engagement with Justice, since she felt that she should explore more of her life and future before marriage. And her second decision was to retire from being a superhero; due to the actions caused by the Super-Human Registration Act, which sparked the Civil War.",

      "biography": "Paul Norbert Ebersol was born in Dayton, Ohio. He was a scientist who held a number of odd jobs, including auto mechanic, television repairman, and electronics laboratory assistant. He then became the second and more prominent Fixer, a supervillain and genius-level criminal inventor who has often worked for criminal cartels like HYDRA.In his first appearance he escaped from prison, and teamed with his partner Mentallo in an attempted takeover of the New York S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters, and even captured Nick Fury. Fixer and Mentallo were defeated by Tony Stark and S.H.I.E.L.D. troops. His connection with THEM was revealed; and THEM was later revealed as part of HYDRA. Behind the scenes, he was even revealed as the chief of the HYDRA Science Division.With Mentallo, the Fixer later escaped prison again. They invaded the New York S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters and captured the Thing. They then invaded the Baxter Building, battled the Thing and Nick Fury, and used Doctor Doom's time machine to bring Deathlok from his alternate future. Mentallo then mind-controlled Deathlok in an attempted assassination of the U.S. President, but Fixer and Mentallo were defeated by the Fantastic Four and taken into custody by S.H.I.E.L.D. The pair was freed from prison by a HYDRA force controlled by Baron Karza. Fixer created the living machine-intelligence Computrex, which was destroyed by the Micronauts, who then defeated Fixer and Mentallo.Fixer and Mentallo then aided Professor Power in his attempt to add Professor X's powers to Mentallo's, but they were defeated by Spider-Man. Fixer attempted to loot Northwind Observatory of Bruce Banner's inventions, but was captured by Captain America. Fixer then invaded the West Coast Avengers Compound in an attempt to steal Iron Man's armor, but was defeated by Iron Man and Ka-Zar.When Baron Helmut Zemo formed the fourth incarnation of the Masters of Evil, Fixer served as his right-hand man. When the Masters of Evil invaded Avengers Mansion, Fixer created a device enabling Baron Zemo to control Blackout. Fixer helped engineer the capture of Captain America, Black Knight, and Edwin Jarvis. Fixer was apprehended by Ant-Man. Behind the scenes, Fixer was overpowered by the Super-Adaptoid, who changed places with him. The Super-Adaptoid disguised as the Fixer later escaped prison. The real Fixer was discovered by the Avengers in the Adaptoid's former confinement tube at Avengers Island. Fixer later escaped prison with Yellowjacket, who then spurned his romantic advances. The Fixer followed her and battled her and the Black Knight before escaping.In Zemo's second incarnation of the Masters of Evil, the team changed their identity to the Thunderbolts, while Fixer adopted the alias of Techno. He was then apparently killed when his neck was broken by Iron, one of the Elements of Doom, and he transferred his mind into a robotic body, and this Techno sided, alone among the Thunderbolts, with Zemo when he went ahead with his scheme to conquer the planet.Zemo and Techno decamped to one of Zemo's bases, where Techno began to experiment with cloning, offering to clone Zemo an unscarred body, and even cloning Kevin Costner for fun at one point. After the two fell out, Techno infiltrated the Thunderbolts by replacing Ogre, while continuing his experiments behind-the-scenes, including recovering Jolt's body when she was killed and placing it in a healing tube.Techno's impersonation of Ogre ended when Scourge stowed away inside him, shrunken, and destroyed his body from the inside, while he refused to kill Jolt again to allow him to construct a new body. However, his backup plan worked, and his consciousness was returned to his original human body—mostly healed, although the nerve damage in his neck meant he required his tech-pac to bypass the damage—and the human Ebersol, initially amnesiac of the robot's exploits, returned to calling himself the Fixer.Fixer then became one of the Redeemers, a government-backed team whereby criminals could use it to accelerate their sentences and clear their record, until most of that team was slaughtered by Graviton. He joined with the reunited Thunderbolts to stop Graviton, and he was one of the team members exiled to Counter-Earth. By a complicated series of events, at the end of the trip to Counter-Earth, Zemo's consciousness ended up in Fixer's tech-pac. By threatening to disable it and leave him quadriplegic, Zemo managed to force Fixer to transfer the Baron's consciousness to his Counter-Earth counterpart's body.The team remained on Counter-Earth for some time, until, in sealing a rift, they returned home, leaving Jolt (whom Fixer saved from burning out in helping to seal the rift) behind. Finally, after Moonstone went insane, Fixer furnished a device that could give the combined Avengers and Thunderbolts a couple of seconds to make their move; he then left.Later, Deadpool visited Fixer at his holiday home enlist his help in saving Cable. After a brief fight, Fixer accepted the challenge (and Deadpool's monetary inducement), and successfully bonded new, benign, techno-organic mesh to Cable. Some time after this, Fixer suddenly reappeared to save MACH-IV, his former teammate, from a fall; the script hinted that Fixer was working with Zemo once more.",

      "biography": "Handsome and naturally athletic, young Eugene Thompson seemed to have a bright future ahead of him, but hidden darkness in his family set the stage for what became a life of wasted potential. His father, popular policeman Harrison Thompson, had a secret drinking problem, and it was all the Thompson family could do to hold him together at times. Alternating between anger and despair, the self-loathing Harrison took out his frustrations on his family, often treating Eugene abusively. Eugene, in turn, became a neighborhood bully, taking out his own frustrations on weaker and less popular children. One of his earliest and longest-running targets was Peter Parker, a bookish boy who later became the masked adventurer Spider-Man.\n\nDespite his often-obnoxious personality, football prodigy Eugene became one of the most popular (and most conceited) students at Midtown High School, where his speed on the football field earned him the lifelong nickname \"Flash\". His wide circle of friends included Sean \"Tiny\" McKeever, Jason Ionello, Seymour O'Reilly, Charlie and numerous female admirers such as Sally Avril and Liz Allan, who was Flash's steady girlfriend for some time. The more popular Flash became, the more he mocked the shy Peter Parker; however, as Parker (secretly emboldened by his new spider-powers) became more confident, he began to stand up to Flash more often, and even took on Flash in a boxing match that ended with Flash being kayoed by a spider-strength jab that most onlookers misinterpreted as a lucky sucker punch. Flash continued to ride Peter despite this setback, and Peter generally tolerated Flash's abuse since he didn't want to risk revealing his super-powers or seriously injuring Thompson. Gradually impressed by Peter's maturity and sick of Flash's bullying, Liz dumped Flash and began showing strong romantic interest in Peter, which only made Thompson hate Parker all the more.\n\nShortly after Spider-Man first appeared, Flash declared himself the wall-crawler's biggest fan, never dreaming that his hero was the same \"Puny Parker\" he so often tormented. As annoyed as Peter was by Flash in general, he was secretly touched and impressed by Thompson's enduring loyalty to Spider-Man. Flash founded the Forest Hills chapter of the Spider-Man fan club and took it upon himself to defend the oft-maligned Spider-Man's reputation, sometimes in reckless and foolish ways. When Flash impersonated Spider-Man in an attempt to teach Parker some respect for the hero, Flash was mistaken for the real thing and imprisoned by Doctor Doom until the true Spider-Man rescued him. Later, when a humiliating encounter with the Green Goblin (Norman Osborn) had the whole city calling Spider-Man a coward, Thompson donned a Spider-Man costume and tackled some cheap crooks in an effort to restore Spidey's reputation, but all he got for his trouble was a beating. Shortly thereafter, when another Spider-Man impersonator tried to tarnish the hero's name with a string of petty crimes, Flash unmasked the culprit as his own friend Jason Ionello, who wrongly blamed Spider-Man for the recent death of their mutual friend Sally Avril during Spider-Man's battle with the Black Knight. Flash also repeatedly denounced the many anti-Spider-Man tirades by Daily Bugle publisher J. Jonah Jameson, and one angry confrontation between Thompson and Jameson caused the unwitting pair to foil a plot against Spider-Man by Mysterio.\n\nWhen Flash and Peter graduated from Midtown High, both were awarded full scholarships to Empire State University (for athletic and academic achievement, respectively). By this time, relations between the two had begun to thaw ever so slightly, and both soon became part of a circle of friends that included fellow students Gwen Stacy, Harry Osborn (son of Norman) and Mary Jane Watson. By the time Flash left college to join the army, he and Peter parted as friends. During his tour of duty, Flash was stationed in Southeast Asia, where he stumbled across a hidden temple whose residents-notably the beautiful Sha Shan-nursed a wounded Flash back to health; however, after American forces mistakenly shelled the temple despite Flash's efforts to protect it, Flash left the army to return to America, where temple survivors who mistakenly blamed him for the tragedy made attempts on his life. With the aid of Spider-Man, Flash lived to convince the temple survivors of his innocence, and was briefly reunited with Sha Shan. Later, Sha Shan returned to America as Sister Sun, the reluctant bride of cult leader Brother Power (Achmed Korba), himself a pawn of the evil Man-Beast. Sha Shan ultimately turned on Korba, and the Man-Beast was thwarted through the combined efforts of Spider-Man, Razorback and Flash. Korba having died in the battle, Sha Shan became Flash's lover and lived with him for some time.\n\nLater, Flash's old friend Betty Brant was struggling to cope with her failing marriage to reporter Ned Leeds, who had secretly been brainwashed into serving as a pawn and occasional stand-in for the criminal Hobgoblin (Roderick Kingsley). Betty sought comfort in the arms of Flash, and soon the two were having a secret affair. Sha Shan realized this and walked out on Flash after a violent argument. The unstable Ned suspected the truth as well, and Flash unwittingly provoked matters further when he insulted the Hobgoblin on television. The Hobgoblin responded by framing Flash as the supposed Hobgoblin, sending Flash to prison, where he would have been killed by the vigilante Scourge if not for the intervention of Spider-Man. Escaping jail, Flash sought refuge with Betty Brant but was attacked by the Hobgoblin, who fled after Betty saw him unmasked as Leeds. Shortly thereafter, word of Ned's double identity leaked out and Leeds was murdered by assassins hired by his rival Jason Macendale, who used Ned's gear to become the new Hobgoblin. Aiding Spider-Man in battle with the new Hobgoblin, Flash suffered an arm injury that ended any hope of restarting his old sports career, but he was cleared of all charges related to the Hobgoblin case and set free.\n\nNed's death sent Betty into a nervous breakdown, and she fell under the influence of a sinister cult known as the Students of Love. Flash, Spider-Man and Reverend Tolliver joined forces to liberate Betty and deprogram her. Having lost all her worldly possessions to the cult (which was destroyed in a fire), Betty took up residence with Thompson until the demonic invasion of New York known as Inferno, when demons posing as Spider-Man and the late Ned attacked Flash's home; the demons were defeated, but Thompson's home was destroyed in the process. Shortly thereafter, Betty and Flash decided they were better off as friends rather than lovers and parted amicably. By now, Peter Parker had married Mary Jane Watson, and Harry Osborn had married Flash's old flame Liz Allan, and odd-man-out Flash was determined to find a new love of his own. For a while, he dated the glamorous adventurer Felicia Hardy, alias the Black Cat. Formerly Spider-Man's lover and partner, Felicia dated Flash mostly to irritate Peter at first, but found herself genuinely falling for Thompson over time; however, Flash ultimately broke up with her since he felt he could never fit into her exotic lifestyle.\n\nDirectionless, lonely and increasingly bitter, Flash developed a drinking problem like his father before him, leading to a car crash that got Flash arrested again and cost him his job as a school gym teacher. By this time, Flash had begun blaming much of his troubles on his family in general and his father in particular, but a violent confrontation with his father finally forced Flash to realize that he had become the same sort of self-deluded wreck his father was, and that only he could take responsibility for fixing his life. Flash sobered up and started trying to turn his life around, though without much success in terms of either romance or career. His luck seemed to change when wealthy industrialist Norman Osborn offered him a good job with his Oscorp company, but Osborn had actually done this as part of an elaborate plot against his enemy Peter Parker in hopes of turning Flash against Spider-Man, though Flash remained loyal to his boyhood idol despite Osborn's influence. Later, when Osborn stepped up his attacks on Parker, he staged a car crash that sent an Oscorp truck crashing into Midtown High with Thompson at the wheel, and made it look as if Flash had been driving drunk. Rendered comatose by the accident, Flash eventually revived, but was broken in mind and body, wheelchair-bound and trapped in a speechless haze. He was regularly visited by old friends such as Peter Parker and Liz Allan Osborn (now Harry's widow), who used her wealth to provide Flash with an apartment and full-time medical care.\n\nFlash has now recovered, and is back at P.S. 108 (the New York City public school numbering for Midtown High) in Forest Hills as a coach. He has partial amnesia, remembering events up through high school. Thus he has forgotten his years of friendship with Peter Parker and had returned to mistreating Peter until Spider-Man's public unmasking shifted his attitude. Flash has been the target of the affections of a mystical entity called Ero posing as school nurse, Miss Arrow.\n\nFlash was recently reactivated to serve in the Army for a tour in Iraq. During the course of his service Flash found himself out numbered with a felow soldier named Santos badly wounded and partly buried. Flash was able to rescue Santos but in the process his legs were badly wounded. As a result Flash lost both his legs below the knee. But when later asked when he was recomended for the Medal of Honor if he had regrets Flash said.\n\n\"No sir. Not a one.\"",

It is known that he was originally a professional football player whose career was somehow suddenly cut short. He somehow developed the costumed identity of Flying Tiger, using a costume that granted him the ability to fly.The Flying Tiger embarked on a mercenary career, and he was first ordered to kill the original Spider-Woman. Although he was initially successful in defeating her, she healed and a later scuffle ended in the Tiger's defeat. Later excursions brought him into conflict with the Fantastic Four, and Iron Man (James Rhodes). In the latter encounter, the Flying Tiger was hired to kidnap businessman Regis Fusskey by his rivals. Fusskey had hired James Rhodes as a pilot and bodyguard, and Rhodes saved Fusskey's life from the Flying Tiger, finally defeating him as Iron Man.More recently, the Flying Tiger was contacted by the Crimson Cowl to join her version of the Masters of Evil. The Flying Tiger remained with the team throughout its existence, often clashing with the Black Widow and the Thunderbolts. Ultimately, the Thunderbolts thwarted the villain's master plan to blackmail the world with a weather-altering device, and the Flying Tiger was among those criminals remanded to policy custody.",

As a result, he was raised by his father and stepmother. Despite the fact that he was abjectly neglected by his biological mother, Foggy was fascinated with the legal profession and was accepted into a pre-law program at Columbia University in New York City.\n\nWhile at Columbia, Foggy was bullied mercilessly, even by guys in his own fraternity, like Roger “Porkchop” Peterson. Luckily, he received protection from fellow law student and future best friend (and Daredevil) Matthew Murdock. When Matt began dating Elektra Natchios, Foggy did not approve. He believed her to be dangerous, which, in the end, turned out to be very true.\n\nThe two went to Harvard Law, where they took their bar exams. While there, Foggy exposed one of his instructors, Professor Golde, for committing plagiarism. He brought down Golde, even when the teacher threatened to tamper with his bar results.\n\nWhile dealing with this dilemma, Foggy witnessed Wilson Fisk (Kingpin) mercilessly beating up the criminal Kruel (Victor Krueller). To keep the witnesses from squealing to the authorities, Fisk had Nelson drugged so he would not remember what he saw. Nevertheless, the incident stuck in the back of the lawyer’s subconscious, motivating him to pursue justice, no matter the cost. Where his fondness for bow ties originated from is anyone’s guess.\n\nDastardly Disputants\n\nFoggy’s biggest foes are the ones he sees in the courtroom, namely other lawyers working against him. One of his earliest enemies, although he’d soon forget it, is Wilson Fisk, who had drugged him after Foggy witnessed the beating of Kruel. Not knowing it, Fisk created a highly-motivated crusader for justice that day as the incident remained in Nelson’s subconscious, driving his career as a lawyer from that point on.\n\nZebediah Killgrave (AKA Purple Man) seeks to use the legal services of Foggy and Matt, but only incurs their wrath when he kidnaps Karen. Other villains who become adversaries of Foggy are Melvin Potter, Leland Owlsley, the Jester (Jonathan Powers), and a time-traveling android known as Mr. Kline.\n\nTrustworthy Teammates\n\nFoggy’s biggest ally is, of course, his best friend, Matt Murdock. Despite going their separate ways a few times over the years, the two have remained close chums since they first met in law school.\n\nWith Murdock as his friend, Foggy also gains Daredevil as a protector. Karen Page is another person on whom Foggy can rely, despite her not reciprocating his romantic feelings towards her. They can usually trust one another when the going gets tough. During the days of Nelson &amp; Murdock, Nelson also represents a number of super powered clientele, like the Fantastic Four who became his friends and allies.",

Forge later rebelled against his Cheyenne heritage and became a U.S. soldier in order to serve in the peacekeeping force in east Asia. When his platoon was lost to a surprise attack by the enemy, Forge was fueled by rage and grief. In revenge, he used his mystical powers to open a portal allowing demons to descend and decimate the entire enemy contingent. However, unable to control the demon swarm, Forge had to call in a bomb raid over the area, and he lost his right hand and leg in the conflagration. After returning to the States for recuperation, Forge decided to give up the use of his magic abilities. He used his mutant talent for inventing to create bionic replacements of his limbs. Turning his back on his mystic side, Forge concentrated on a career as an inventor and was commissioned by the Department of Defense to create weaponry. His many inventions include a device for neutralizing superhuman abilities, necessitated by the presence of the alien Dire Wraiths that were invading Earth at the time. Instead, however, Henry Gyrich and Valerie Cooper hoped to use the weapon against mutants and decided to test the prototype against Rogue, who was framed for murder at the time. Although Rogue was saved by her teammate Storm, Storm was accidentally hit and stripped of her powers. Storm fell into a river and was rescued by Forge. Feeling guilty for her loss of powers, Forge brought Storm to his headquarters in Dallas, Texas and nursed her back to health. The two developed a romantic relationship until Storm learned of Forge's role in the loss of her powers, and she left, furious at him. However, Storm did return with other X-Men and associates to save Forge's life from the Dire Wraiths.Forge was able to improve his device to neutralize the Dire Wraiths, and joined with the Dire Wraiths' ultimate foe, the Spaceknight Rom, to stop the Wraiths in Dallas and to send a gigantic \"neo-neutralizer\" to their home planet, casting all Dire Wraiths to an extradimensional limbo. Forge destroyed all neutralizing technology to avoid it falling into the hands of Gyrich and the American government.\nSome time later, Storm returned to Forge to find a way to get her powers back. She was tricked by the demon known as the Adversary (who had taken the form of Naze) into attempting to kill Forge, effectively stopping him from closing a similar demonic portal to the one he had opened before. Forge and Storm found themselves shunted to another dimension with an accelerated time structure. There, they rekindled their romance and Forge eventually restored Storm's powers. They both returned to Earth in time to help the rest of the X-Men stop Adversary and the demonic forces. To do so, he was forced to utilize the souls of the X-Men, even though the heroes were restored to life soon after. Forge left to go into seclusion believing he had killed the X-Men.Some time later, Forge saw Storm in a vision and realized that the X-Men must not be dead. Realizing the vision was somehow connected to the villain Shadow King, he elicited the help of Mystique's Freedom Force who were working for the American government. Together, they left for the research facility Muir Island which was in the process of being taken over by the Shadow King. Their arrival coincided with the villains called the Reavers. They saved the island from the Reavers with help from mutants living on Muir Island, but Forge was unable to save Freedom Force member Destiny, who Mystique had placed under his protection.After the battle, Forge convinced former X-Man Banshee that the X-Men were alive, and the two set off to find them. They succeeded in reuniting several mutants, including Storm, and began to repair the remains of their former mansion headquarters in Westchester. However, they were all captured by agents of the country Genosha, working on behalf of Cameron Hodge. Forge battled alongside the X-Men in Genosha to escape, then in the Shi'ar Galaxy to rescue the X-Men's mentor, Professor X, and finally at Muir Island to rid its inhabitants from the Shadow King once and for all.Forge returned with the X-Men to completely restore their mansion to their previous level of technology. Forge proposed to Storm, but when she would not leave the X-Men for him, he retracted his offer. He returned to Dallas with Mystique, taking it upon himself (and fulfilling Destiny's dying prophecy) to rehabilitate her as she was suffering from psychological damage after having been possessed by the Shadow King. Forge and Mystique were attacked by the time-hopping mutant Fitzroy and were rescued by the X-Men. Mystique left Forge soon afterward, claiming her sufferings were a ruse to enable her to steal sensitive information from Forge's computers.\nForge was then contacted by Valerie Cooper to become the government liaison to a new version of the mutant team X-Factor, modeled after the defunct government-sanctioned Freedom Force. Forge soon became an active member of the team, participating on many missions and supplying the team with its technology. During this time, he was reunited with Mystique and also fixed a holographic module that contained the mutant law enforcer from the future, Shard. When team leader Havok was MIA, Forge took his place. He later reclaimed his mystical heritage in another confrontation with the Adversary, defeating him by using both his technological and his magical abilities.Later still, Forge divorced X-Factor from government sanction in order to take the team underground. Soon after, however, the team was nearly destroyed by the rampaging of its member Sabretooth, and Forge quit the team, returning leadership to Havok.After a time, Forge was contacted by Professor X to infiltrate Genosha with Jamie Madrox, the Multiple Man, since Magneto had seized control over the country. In reality, Magneto's acolyte Exodus was posing as Magneto, and he captured Forge to force him to enhance his psionic powers. The X-Men rescued Forge, and he returned to his clandestine mission observing Genosha. With the apparent demise of Magneto and the freedom of Genosha, Forge returned to the X-Men where he acted as a member of the team's support crew.Retiring from the X-Men to create a new high-tech headquarters in Baltimore, Forge was contacted by Professor X once again. He needed Mystique's help in order to track the murderer of one of his secret mutant operatives. They rescued Mystique from a state execution that was to be her sentence, setting her up as one of Professor X's underground agents. Forge became her support technician, supplying her with technology and weapons, despite their rocky relationship and Forge's continued feelings for her.",

      "biography": "Franklin Richards is a powerful mutant and travels the universe with Earth’s first family of super heroes, the Fantastic Four (FF). From an early age, he has the ability to manipulate reality, he can perceive his invisible mother, and create more powerful avatars of himself by accident or in times of great crisis. While his cosmic-level powers attract super villains, he knows that no matter how bad things get, his family would always do their best for him.\n \n\nOrigin\n\nFranklin Benjamin Richards is the elder child of FF founders Reed and Susan Storm Richards. Though Franklin had a troubled childhood from the start; while pregnant with him, Sue suffered strange “cosmic impulses of living energy” in her blood due to the cosmic rays that empowered the FF, endangering herself and her unborn son. The rest of the FF entered the Negative Zone and stole the Cosmic Control Rod from that dimension’s would-be conqueror Annihilus, using the rod’s power to reduce the pregnant Sue’s internal energies. \n\nThough the birth proves uneventful, Franklin would become one of Earth’s most powerful mutants. Reed and Sue named him after Susan’s father, Franklin, who had sacrificed his own life to save his children, and Reed’s best friend Ben Grimm, aka Thing.\n&nbsp;\n\nReality Manipulation &amp; Psionic Powers\n\nFranklin inherits cosmic-ray charged genes from his parents and is born highly intelligent and intuitive. His psionic, reality manipulation, and telepathic powers manifest as a young child but being inexperienced, he has limited control over them.\n\nEgo-Spawn&nbsp;is Franklin’s psychic powers and repressed frustrations projected into the human form of the bully Franco Berardi. His force field proved impervious to the Human Torch’s flames, and he fired energy bolts (from his hands or eyes) able to knock the Fantasticar out of the air.\n\nAvatar is the auto-matured Franklin. As Avatar, he has vast psychic powers, able to telepathically probe others and/or render them unconscious. He can hold the Human Torch’s plasma form, unharmed by the flames, as well as transform and rearrange matter (even living beings), opening holes in or dissolving walls, reshaping and coloring garb, release painful psychic bursts, project explosive energy blasts, and levitate. The Avatar possessed much of Reed Richards’ scientific knowledge, though he was almost totally lacking in its application. Avatar’s subsequent manifestation was a pure ethereoid (psycho-plasmic projection), representing Franklin’s (actually Psi-Lord)’s peaceful and logical aspects. He was intangible, though it’s possible he can take solid form. He can fly and presumably could access any of Psi-Lord’s telepathic and psychokinetic powers. \n\nAs he grows up and becomes Tattletale, while relaxed, Franklin projects a dream-self that he manifests remotely, at distances up to a planetary scale; this intangible astral-self is capable of hearing, seeing and speaking in the waking world, and can be seen by others. He also has intermittent precognitive flashes while awake, usually featuring events in his very immediate future, seconds or minutes away.\n\nDark Hunter embodies Franklin’s subconscious need to accept his parents’ apparent death. He possessed a Darkforce-like semi-solid body, able to re-form from attacks and reshape himself at will. He uses a large “ship of empty souls” to navigate the false realities created by Franklin to distract himself. \n&nbsp;\n\nOpposing Forces\n\nMephisto the Hell-Lord is a menace to the Fantastic Four and when he pulls their souls down to hell, Franklin defeats him in defense of his family by scattering him into multiple dimensions.\n\nVictor von Doom, aka Dr. Doom, is the Fantastic Four’s greatest foe, and as such kidnaps Franklin to use him for his powers of reality manipulation. He also sends Franklin to Hell but he is quickly rescued.\n\nFranklin gets himself into trouble, and his family too, since his reality manipulation powers are too powerful for his young mind. Because of his lack of control, he ends up inadvertently changing the lives of his family, once transporting his grown sister back into his mother’s womb.\n&nbsp;\n\nFamily Ties and Allies\n\nFranklin’s parents Reed Richards and Susan Storm Richards go to great lengths to understand his powers and give him a normal life since their commitments to the Fantastic Four take them all over the universe. Franklin also has a sister that apparently dies at birth though he uses his psionic powers to reach back in time and save her, sending her to an alternate future. He grows up for a time without her, but they meet again when she accidentally time-dances back into their family’s life as Valeria Von Doom.\n\nThe Fantastic Four are Franklin’s extended family, some biological and some not. Johnny Storm, aka Human Torch, is Franklin’s uncle while Ben Grimm, aka Thing, is his godfather. While Franklin gets abducted many times, he also saves his FF family many times over and will create whole worlds in an effort to protect them. Other super teams such as the Avengers and Inhumans work alongside the FF to fight super villains, therefore Franklin grows up around them.\n\nFranklin has many caretakers over the years including the mystical Agatha Harkness, a dimensionally displaced Caledonia, the Avengers butler Edwin Jarvis, and the robotic babysitter known as H.U.B.E.R.T. (Hyper-Ultronic Brain Employing Randomized Tracings).\n&nbsp;",

      "biography": "Created by the mutant Mad Jim Jaspers of Earth-238, the Fury was the ultimate killing machine, an adapting cybiote unleashed on the superhumans of its world, programmed to spare only its creator. It methodically hunted down and slew every other superhuman on the planet. Only one victim escaped its purge; Captain U.K. (Linda McQuillan) was teleported interdimensionally to Earth-616 by her husband Rick, moments before the Fury murdered him. Frustrated by being unable to kill Jaspers, its mission otherwise completed, the Fury was placed into storage.When Captain Britain of Earth-616 (Brian Braddock) and his companion Jackdaw arrived on Earth-238, the Fury was reactivated. It swiftly slew both of its new targets, though Captain Britain was reconstructed and returned to Earth-616 by Merlyn. Instinctively aware its job was incomplete, the Fury modified itself to pursue, unbothered by the raging reality warp Jaspers’ mutant powers had precipitated; doggedly single minded, it survived the destruction of its entire reality performed to prevent Jaspers’ warp from spreading to other timelines. Reaching Earth-616, it tracked its prey to Braddock Manor, coming upon the former Captain U.K. in the grounds, and would have slain her, had Merlyn not intervened. Captain Britain and his allies, the cross-dimensional mercenaries the Special Executive, engaged the Fury in battle; after sustaining a number of fatalities, they buried it under several tons of rock while it was temporarily confused by its inability to detect the temporally displaced Zeitgeist.The Fury dug its way out and pursued Captain Britain to London, unconcerned by reality once more breaking down due to Earth-616’s version of Jaspers. Finding its target fighting 616’s Jaspers, it reasoned this alternate Jaspers was not protected by the programming which had prevented it killing its creator, and attacked him. Having extensively improved itself during its pursuit of Captain Britain, the Fury proved capable of holding its own against Jaspers, finally transported them to the void where its own reality had once been. Lacking material to manipulate, Jaspers reverted to human form, and the Fury swiftly slew him. It returned to Earth-616, severely weakened, and Captain Britain and U.K. took the opportunity to destroy it before it could recover.The unfortunate Sidney Crumb subsequently mutated into a monster as a result of a near miss with the Fury when it first arrived on Earth-616, but otherwise the cybiote appeared to be gone for good. However, the X-Men recently found a version of the Fury in the caverns beneath Braddock Manor, which they later learned had been created by Jamie Braddock to test them. It fought the team to a standstill before they managed to send it into a miniature black hole. It (or a Fury dimensional counterpart from another reality in the multiverse) briefly managed to return to Earth-616, but was sent back into the interdimensional void through the combined efforts of Earth-9411's Captain Britain and Spider-Man.Mad Jim Jaspers has also returned, seemingly brought back to life by the Scarlet Witch’s recent reality warp and manifesting some of the Fury’s physical traits.",

      "biography": "Gaea was one of the Elder Gods who materialized on Earth before any life appeared there. She and her brother Chthon inhabited Earth's land masses, affecting geological patterns. Except for Gaea, the Elder Gods degenerated into demons, preying upon each other. Gaea called upon the Demiurge, the sentient life force of Earth's biosphere, and gave birth to Atum, who became Demogorge and slaughtered the other Elder Gods, though some, like Chthon and Set, escaped extradimensionally (Note: Many beings incorrectly refer to themselves as Elder Gods). Gaea infused her life essence into all living beings on Earth. She protected Earth from the influence of Set, supporting the development of humanity over dinosaurs and leading the Celestials to destroy a group of Serpent Men.Gaea became the mother god to virtually all of the pantheons of later gods in humanity, receiving many different names. In her guise of Jord she mated with the Asgardian god Odin to conceive Thor. A millennium ago she learned of humanity's future judgment by the Celestials and organized goddesses of numerous pantheons to gather the best examples of humanity. This resulted in the Young Gods, whose existence swayed the Celestials to judge in humanity's favor in the 21st century. Gaea continues to grant power to many who call on her, from the ancient Sisters of Danu to the modern Ardina, Brother Nature, Clea, Dark Mairi, Doctor Strange, the Neurii, the god Prometheus, and Topaz. She has even directed opposition to threats such as Dormammu (who once held her prisoner until she channeled the life force of every being on Earth to banish him) and Maelstrom. Her pain resulting from the harm humanity had done to Earth, nearly drove the mutant Humus Sapien to take the lives of all mankind. She was captured by the extradimensional scientist Yandroth and forced to place a curse on the earliest Defenders, compelling them to gather to oppose threats to Earth. She continued to perpetuate this curse herself for a time, pleased to have even unwilling protectors, but she dissolved it after the Defenders became corrupt due to Yandroth's influence. She informed Nighthawk that he would have the power to summon them should the need arise.",

      "biography": "An Ancient Existence\n\nSole survivor of the universe existing before the Big Bang, Galactus is perhaps the most feared being in the cosmos. Untold billions of years ago, he was born the humanoid Galan on the planet Taa, a wondrous paradise of scientific and social achievement; however, his universe was in its final stages, with all matter plunging towards a central point via the \"Big Crunch\", collapsing into a new \"Cosmic Egg\", a sphere of disorganized, compact primordial matter. Galan, a space explorer, discovered a radiation-plague threatening all of Taa. Though he was initially scoffed at, the truth became clear as the people of surrounding planets perished. Despite the efforts of Taa's greatest scientists, no cure could be found, and the population began to die off. Galan convinced the handful of remaining survivors to die gloriously by flying a starship into the blazing cosmic cauldron. The others were killed by the intense radiation, but Galan was filled with new energy and saved by the Phoenix Force of the dying universe. The sentient energy spoke to Galan as it brought him into the Egg.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRebirth\n\nWith the next Big Bang, the Cosmic Egg matter exploded outwards, eventually condensing into stars and planets. The future Galactus and his starship were re-created simultaneously with the embodiments of Eternity and Death, though he drifted inert for billions of years while new life began to populate the universe. The starship crashed on an unnamed planet, where Ecce The Watcher saw its occupant emerge as raw energy. Ecce recognized the danger the nascent being would pose and could have destroyed him then, but instead abides by his oath of non-interference. Launching his ship back into space, the being ejected its lifeless companions into the void, there to drift in endless flight. He then created a suit of armor to harness and regulate his awesome energies, and transformed his ship into an incubation chamber, where he spent countless centuries evolving into his current form. Eventually his craft again fell into orbit around a verdant planet, Archeopia. The advanced natives scanned the craft, detected its awesome energies, and wisely left it undisturbed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe Giant Awakens\n\nYears later, when interstellar war spread into that space sector, the Archeopians' unidentified enemies mistook the incubation craft for a weapon and fired upon it. Emerging unscathed, the being who adopted the name Galactus swiftly slaughtered invader and defender alike, then consumed the life-energies of Archeopia, the first of many worlds that would perish for his hunger; only a small fleet of Archeopians managed to escape. Surveying the destruction he had wrought, Galactus decided to create a world to outshine any other in existence. Though it took millennia, including breaks to replenish his energies, Galactus completed Taa II, an immense ship engulfing the entire Archeopian system, which he made his new home.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe Hunger Grows\n\nGalactus initially went centuries between feedings, seeking out uninhabited worlds that could support life; but he gradually hungered more frequently, and began consuming inhabited worlds if he could find no others. He rationalized his actions by deeming himself a higher being, a belief made easier after learning of a prophecy that he would eventually compensate for all his destruction. In addition, he eventually encountered Eternity and Death, and the three beings hypothesized that Galactus represented a balancing force between the two opposites.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCompanionship\n\nLonely, Galactus created a being in his own image; however, while Galactus was content to survive, his creation craved conquest. The creation, becoming known as Tyrant, battled his creator in a struggle beyond description. Galactus eventually triumphed, possibly aided by the Spinsterhood order of women warriors, banishing Tyrant to parts unknown. Since then, Galactus has used many mindless servants, chief among which are the Punishers, possibly living beings enslaved or created by Galactus. Eventually, the world-devourer realized it was more efficient to send a herald to seek out worlds for him. His first herald was eventually cast out and imprisoned, presumably due to its corrupt and violent nature. This former herald, the Fallen One, escaped many times over the millennia, each time heading directly after its previous master, who always defeated it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRise of the Silver Surfer\n\nGalactus threatened to devour the planet Zenn-La, but was persuaded by native Norrin Radd to spare it in exchange for becoming a new herald. Galactus transformed Radd into the Silver Surfer, suppressing his morals so that he would lead Galactus to inhabited worlds when necessary, such as the planet of the symbiotes and the Kree planet Tarsis. The Surfer once even led Galactus into ending the threat of the murderous warlord Kallreich the Unconquerable by consuming a world he had invaded. When the Silver Surfer brought Galactus to Earth, despite the efforts of Uatu The Watcher to hide the planet, Alicia Masters reached Norrin's long-submerged emotions, convincing him to turn against his master. Galactus had easily overpowered the Fantastic Four, but the Surfer's power delayed Galactus' meal long enough for Reed Richards to present him with his first defeat. Uatu sent the Human Torch to Galactus' worldship to retrieve the Ultimate Nullifier, a device allegedly having the power to destroy even mighty Galactus; Reed used it to force him to spare Earth, but Galactus punished the Surfer for his betrayal by trapping him on Earth.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSoon after, Galactus sensed abundant energy sources within the enigmatic Black Galaxy, but Galactus was distracted when Dr. Doom usurped the Silver Surfer's power and crashed into Galactus' barrier; sensing this disturbance, Galactus scanned Doom, but found him beneath his notice and sent him back to Latveria. Galactus soon sent his Punisher to retrieve the Surfer from Earth; the Fantastic Four held it off long enough for the Surfer to escape into the microverse. Galactus forced them to help him find the Surfer, who located an uninhabited planet for him, after which he left the Surfer trapped on Earth for easy future location.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNew Heralds and Defeated Hunger\n\nConsuming the world Taur to replenish his stores, Galactus journeyed into the Black Galaxy, where he encountered Ego The Living Planet. With the aid of Thor, recruited by the Colonizers of Rigel, Ego drove off Galactus; the surviving Archeopians made Ego their new home. Galactus was targeted by Dr. Doom, who used the reality-altering Cosmic Cube and other weapons to steal Galactus' power, but he retook the power with the aid of the Fantastic Four. Seeking a new herald, Galactus transformed Gabriel Lan, captain of the Xandarian starship Way-Opener, into the Air-Walker, but he was subsequently slain defending his master from the alien Ovoids. Galactus transferred Lan's life-spark into an Air-Walker robot and followed it to Earth, where it was destroyed by the Fantastic Four. Galactus then forced the Surfer to agree to follow him anywhere in the universe, but Reed Richards altered Galactus' ship controls, sending him into the Negative Zone, beyond the scope of the Surfer's promise.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMore Betrayal, More Strife\n\nReturning to the Earth dimension, Galactus empowered Lan's former first officer Pyreus Kril as his new herald, Firelord. He sent Kril to recruit Thor's aid against the now-maddened Ego, who had consumed the Archeopians. Thor freed Firelord from Galactus' servitude by offering the Asgardian Destroyer construct in his place. The Destroyer led Galactus to the High Evolutionary's Counter-Earth, and the Evolutionary summoned the Fantastic Four for aid. Though the heroes' efforts to find unpopulated worlds found only the robot-world Mekka and one of the Skrullian Kral worlds, the Impossible Man offered his own planet, Poppup, whose people suffered from terminal boredom. Consuming Poppup, Galactus faded from existence due to cosmic indigestion. During Galactus' absence, his ship was invaded by the god Loki, who stole the Destroyer, and also by the time-traveling Korvac, who absorbed immense power and plotted to conquer the universe. Upon re-forming, Galactus realized what had happened and turned the Ultimate Nullifier against Korvac, who feigned death to escape. Reed Richards then summoned Galactus to Earth to defeat the power of the Sphinx. In exchange, the Fantastic Four found a replacement herald; per Galactus' requirements, one not so concerned about innocent lives. From the planet Lanlak, the Four recruited its lord, Tyros, whom Galactus transformed into Terrax the Tamer.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDouble Crossed and Near Death\n\nHowever, Terrax proved disloyal; after locating a number of planets, Terrax tried to claim a new empire for himself. When Galactus tried to recall him, Terrax fled into a black hole. In response, Galactus' drone R-11 recruited the Dazzler, who recovered Terrax after Galactus briefly imbued her with power cosmic. Resuming his duties, Terrax led the planet-eater to Galador, where Galactus slew that world's Prime Director and the warrior Terminator before the Spaceknight ROM convinced Galactus to instead seek out Wraithworld, the home of Galador's Dire Wraith enemies. The magic of Wraithworld and its Dark Nebula proved too much for Galactus, but he nonetheless honored his agreement to spare Galador, though he transported it to a distant location unknown to the Spaceknights. Terrax next led Galactus back to Earth, hoping the Fantastic Four could again defeat him, but Galactus stripped Terrax of his power and cast him out. The Fantastic Four, Avengers, and Dr. Strange defeated the exhausted Galactus, but as the world devourer lay dying, Reed organized efforts to save him. Galactus nonetheless needed to feed, but instead accepted the Human Torch Frankie Raye's offer to become his new herald, transforming her into Nova.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA Great Feast\n\nNova initially led Galactus to populated worlds, including Kehil, the surviving natives of which she later found a new home. When Galactus' life force had ebbed so low that he was visited by Death itself, Nova led him to feed on Tarnax IV, the Skrull Throneworld, an act which threw the Skrull empire into chaos; a group of time-traveling X-Men narrowly escaped Tarnax IV in time. Shortly thereafter, Reed Richards was tried by an intergalactic group for his crime of saving Galactus, but was acquitted after Galactus himself appeared, and his ties to the life of the universe were revealed by Eternity; though the specific memory quickly faded from those present, the sense that Galactus had a specific purpose in the universe was retained.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAgainst All Odds\n\nSoon after, Galactus was transported to the artificially created Battleworld by the Beyonder to serve in his \"Secret Wars\". Galactus instead attempted to devour Battleworld, but Dr. Doom briefly usurped his power once more. Shortly after revoking the Silver Surfer's exile on Earth, Galactus was assaulted by the Elders of the Universe, who sought to destroy him and the universe, and be reborn in the next universe as Galactus had been. The Surfer and Nova helped Galactus defeat their plots, which included battles with Ego and the cosmic In-Betweener, and a trip into a black hole, after which Galactus replenished himself on the populated world Naja-7. After assisting Power Pack in curing a maddened Nova, Galactus was drawn back to Earth by the power of the Phoenix Force, briefly battling its then-host, Rachel Summers, before acknowledging the Force as essential to the universe.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDrawn Into War\n\nGalactus was again summoned to Earth to defeat a deadly threat, the Consortium, and was banished to the inter-dimensional world Quwrll. After his return, the Surfer warned Galactus of the mad Titan Thanos, made virtually omnipotent by the Infinity Gems. Galactus scoffed at this threat until Thanos mocked him by eliminating a planet upon which Galactus had intended to feed. Ironically enough, Galactus was also taunted by the Deviant-Inhuman hybrid Maelstrom, who had acquired vast power as well, though he was soon destroyed by a black hole of his own making. After consuming another planet, Galactus joined a number of cosmic entities in opposing Thanos and then the space-pirate Nebula (who took the gems from Thanos), but even mighty Galactus was of little weight against the Infinity Gems. Galactus joined the other cosmic beings in deciding that the hero Adam Warlock was not worthy to hold the collective Gems, as well as investigating the threat of the cosmically powered Edifice Rex, who sought to clean up the universe.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nShortly thereafter, Galactus, Nova, Dr. Strange, and the Surfer investigated the powerful energies harnessed by Warlock's dark counterpart, the Magus. In the process, he encountered the mystic entity Agamotto and the extra-dimensional exile, Khoon the Explorer. The Magus utilized five reality-altering Cosmic Containment Units, dwarfing Galactus' power; Galactus convinced the god-like Living Tribunal to allow the Infinity Gems to be used collectively again, playing directly into the hands of the Magus, who usurped the Gems and added them to his power. Galactus saved the lives of the heroes opposing the Magus, while Warlock facilitated the Magus' banishment to the realm within the Infinity Soul Gem.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSympathy and Greed\n\nNova grew close to Galactus, even becoming privy to his emotions and private thoughts; but Galactus dismissed her when she resisted the idea of leading him to inhabited worlds. Galactus then empowered the blood-thirsty Morg as his new herald, but Morg's lust for power led past heralds to war against him. Nova apparently died at Morg's hands, and after the other heralds slew Morg, Galactus accepted both the Firelord and the restored Air-Walker android as heralds while he secretly resurrected Morg, this time keeping him more manageable; however, Morg was soon abducted by Galactus' old rival, Tyrant, who sought to challenge his creator again. Unwilling to risk battle with Tyrant at the time, Galactus reluctantly allowed Tyrant to retain Morg in exchange for a temporary truce. Morg later escaped and returned to Galactus, and only the Surfer saved the other two heralds from his wrath. When Tyrant confronted Galactus and managed to overpower him, Morg discharged the Ultimate Nullifier in an effort to stop Tyrant, but also apparently destroyed himself and Galactus.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGalactus survived by escaping extra-dimensionally and was later summoned by Reed to oppose the power of Hyperstorm; the two beings were drawn back to the dimensional void. Later, Galactus sent the Surfer after a power object, which proved to be an ancient demon. Galactus testified before Roma on the Fantastic Four's ability to safely watch over Franklin Richards, after which he consumed one of the Collector's specimen worlds, which had been unwittingly exposed to him by Wolverine. Galactus next located an extra-dimensional gladiator whom he had been tracking for decades, transforming him into his herald, until he was liberated by the Fantastic Four.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nConsumed by Hunger\n\nGalactus' hunger grew greater than ever, driving him mad with desire to consume sentient life. Recruiting a new herald, Red Shift, Galactus devoured world after world, including Verdant, until a union of Earth's heroes and the armies of several races, including the Kree and Shi'ar, mounted an offensive against him. Ultimately the Surfer turned Galactus' own ship against him, and it consumed his form, dispersing him into inert energy. One of Galactus' old enemies, Abraxas, now left without anyone to hold him in check, threatened to destroy a number of realities, including Earth-616 (mainstream Earth). Franklin Richards and Marvel Girl (the future Valeria Richards) combined their reality-altering powers to re-form Galactus, who then directed the Ultimate Nullifier's destruction of Abraxas, restoring the universes.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter again opposing Thanos (then powered by the Heart of the Infinite), Galactus fell prey to a near-fatal deception. The extra-dimensional Hunger, who consumed universes as Galactus consumed worlds, duped the planet-eater into believing that he could use the Infinity Gems to forever end his appetite; however, the device he constructed instead formed a portal that allowed Hunger entry into his universe. This time it was Thanos who saved all of existence, seemingly destroying Hunger. As a weakened Galactus recovered, the Fallen One again escaped and pursued him, but was defeated by Thanos and the diminutive powerhouse Skreet. During the event known as the Annihilation, the world devourer was sought out by the remaining Proemial Gods, Aegis and Tenebrous for his atrocities against there brethren. Still in a weakened state from his encounters with Hunger, Thanos and the Fallen One, Galactus along with the Silver Surfer, was easily defeated by the Proemial Gods and handed over to Annihilus. While holding Galactus in captivity, Annihilus persuaded Thanos to find a way to harness his mighty “power cosmic” to use the world devourer as a cosmic cannon. Galactus would eventually freed by the actions of Drax the Destroyer. Soon after, Galactus was assaulted by yet another extra-dimensional powerhouse who sought the origins of the universe, but he recovered via the actions of the Avengers and a league of heroes from another reality.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe Survivors Rebel, The Torch Transformed\n\nA group of survivors of Galactus' predations discovered a means to shield worlds from him, but learned that a power on Earth could overcome this technology. Zius led the survivors to Earth to prevent Galactus from obtaining this power: the Invisible Woman. Reed Richards switched the powers of the Invisible Woman with the Human Torch, deceiving Zius into believing he had neutralized her power; however, Galactus arrived almost immediately afterwards and claimed Johnny as his new herald, amplifying his powers via the power cosmic. While pretending to fulfill his mission, Johnny sought to rally other worlds against Galactus, ultimately delaying him until the Fantastic Four and Quasar could arrive to help. Johnny's new powers allowed him to analyze Galactus' nature, and he instructed Reed and Quasar to form a device that temporarily transformed Galactus back to the powerless Galan. Brought to Manhattan while Reed raced to find an alternate energy source for him, Galan was impressed with humanity's indomitable will and constant struggle against hardship, and he chose to exile himself extra-dimensionally rather than risk destroying it all when his power returned.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBack to Basics\n\nApparently reverting to his old ways upon regaining his power, Galactus returned and recruited a new herald, Stardust, who worshipped his master and believed others should submit to him. Galactus then consumed the second home of the Korbinite race, though the people's life forces were preserved in a Meta-Orb. When their protector, Beta Ray Bill, fought Stardust, the herald unwittingly opened a dimensional warp that unleashed the monstrous Astoreth, who threatened to consume the entire universe. While Bill joined forces with Stardust against her, Galactus empowered Bill's predecessor, Alpha Ray Bill, who sacrificed himself and Stardust in the process of driving Astoreth into a black hole.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBeyond good and evil, forced to destroy entire worlds to survive, Galactus is intimately tied to the nature of the universe. He believes it is his destiny to ultimately give back to the universe much more than he has taken. He currently has two heralds, Silver Surfer, and Stardust.\n\n*Note: The Surfer once believed the enigmatic cosmic Other had consumed Zenn-La shortly after his departure and that Zenn-La's existence was a mere illusion maintained by Galactus. However, numerous interactions of Shalla-Bal and other Zenn-Lavians with the people of Earth and other races would seem to refute this. The truth remains uncertain.\n\n*Note: Although Galactus is usually represented in humanoid form, each sentient being perceives him having a form resembling that of his own race; humans see him as humanoid and Skrulls as Skrullian.",

      "biography": "Abandoned at birth due to his burning red eyes, the child who would one day become Remy LeBeau was kidnapped from his hospital ward by members of the New Orleans Thieves' Guild who referred to the child as \"le diable blanc\" - the white devil. They believed he was the child that had been prophesied to unite the warring Guilds. Soon after, Remy was placed in the care of a gang of street thieves who raised the child and taught him the ways of thievery.\n\nLater, when he was around ten years old, Remy attempted to pick the pocket of Jean-Luc LeBeau, then-patriarch of the Thieves’ Guild. Jean-Luc took the boy in off the streets and adopted him into his own family. As part of a peace pact between the Thieves’ Guild and their rivals, the Assassin’s Guild, a marriage was arranged between Remy and Bella Donna Boudreaux, the granddaughter of the head of the Assassin's Guild. However, Bella Donna's brother Julien objected to the marriage and challenged Gambit to a duel. Remy killed Julien in self-defense, but was excommunicated and banished from New Orleans in an attempt to maintain the nonaggression pact between the two guilds.\n\nRemy wandered the world as he plied his skills as a master thief, aided by his mutant power to charge objects with explosive energy. He employed playing cards he charged with kinetic energy as his trademark weapon. At one point Remy had approached the master geneticist Mr. Sinister for help in controlling his powers. Sinister removed some of Remy's brain tissue to reduce his power levels, thus affording him a greater degree of control. As a result, Remy was now in the geneticist's debt, and Sinister subsequently charged the thief with assembling the team of assassins called the Marauders. Remy did not realize that Sinister would employ the Marauders to massacre the underground mutant community known as the Morlocks. Seeing the horrific results of his actions, Remy attempted to stop the massacre but was almost killed by the Marauder named Sabretooth. However, he did manage to save one young Morlock girl who would one day grow up to become the X-Man named Marrow.\n\nEventually, Remy encountered Storm, a member of the outlaw team of mutant adventurers known as the X-Men. Storm had been transformed into an amnesiac child who had turned to theft as a means to survive. Remy helped her escape her enemy, the malevolent psionic entity known as the Shadow King, and they became partners. Later, when the X-Men's founder Professor Charles Xavier returned from a long period of traveling in outer space, Storm sponsored Remy's admission into the X-Men. Remy soon fell in love with his fellow X-Man, Rogue, blessed and cursed with the ability to absorb other mutants' thoughts and abilities through skin-on-skin contact. The feeling was mutual, but the two soulmates were condemned never to touch. At one point, Rogue left the X-Men after she kissed Remy and absorbed a portion of his memories, learning of his role in the Morlock Massacre.\n\nRemy was subsequently captured and brought before a mock trial held by Magneto, the mutant master of magnetism, then disguised as Erik the Red. He was summarily cast out of the X-Men and was abandoned in the frozen wastes of Antarctica. Starving to death, Remy made his way back into Magneto's citadel where he came upon the psionic essence of a dead mutant named Mary Purcell. The wraith-like Mary bonded with him, allowing him to survive until he reached the Savage Land, a hidden jungle nestled in the icy wasteland. There, Remy struck a deal with the enigmatic being known as the New Sun. In exchange for passage back to America, Remy agreed to run errands for the New Sun.\n\nRemy returned home and encountered the X-Men again when he attempted to steal the fabled Crimson Gem of Cyttorak for his new employer. He agreed to return to the team, mainly for his self-respect and for his love for Rogue. However, Mary began to threaten Remy and his friends if he didn't agree to stay with her forever. When the X-Men finally found out about Mary, the wraith fled with Remy to her old hometown, where she tried to force him to merge with her and become a new type of hybrid lifeform. While Remy wrestled with her, Rogue charged in with a containment unit, which ultimately dispersed Mary.\n\nDuring a trip back in time, Remy's powers were restored to their maximum potential by Sinister and he was able to utilize them to return to the present. Soon after his return, Remy served for a time as patriarch of the Thieves' Guild in his father's stead, as well as leading one of two teams of X-Men. Remy was also responsible for the unification of the Thieves' and Assassins' Guilds into the Unified Guild, of which he also served briefly as patriarch.\n\nMeanwhile, the New Sun revealed his true nature after organizing an assassination game for a cadre of super-powered mercenaries with Remy as the target. When Remy took the fight back to the New Sun, he was shocked to learn that the New Sun was actually an alternate reality version of himself. In his own reality, the New Sun's kinetic charging powers had flared out of control, burning the world and killing everyone. As a result, the New Sun hunted down and killed versions of himself in other realities to ensure that they would not repeat his mistakes. During their final battle, Remy burned out his enhanced powers to defeat the New Sun, ending his threat and returning his powers to their normal level.\n\nRemy was later framed by mutant businessman Sebastian Shaw for the death of the Australian crimelord named Viceroy. With the assistance of Rogue, her team of X-Treme X-Men, and former Triad member Red Lotus, Remy was able to clear his name. Soon after, Remy became embroiled in the X-Treme X-Men's fight against an alien invasion of Earth. He was captured and used as a power source for the invaders to open a portal that would allow their full invasion fleet to pass through and complete the conquest of Earth. The process was halted by the enigmatic villain known as Vargas, who plunged his sword into Remy's chest. Remy survived, but found that he had lost his mutant abilities. As a result, he and the also-powerless Rogue sought to live a normal life together and retired from the X-Men.\n\nHowever try as they might, a normal life was not for them to lead as the pair soon became embroiled in the X-Treme X-Men's fight against the mutant predator Elias Bogan. After Bogan was defeated, the X-Man named Sage used her mutant ability to \"jumpstart\" Remy's mutant powers and he rejoined the team.\n\nIn an alternate future over 70 years from now in which the X-Man Bishop was born, Remy had become an aged figure named the Witness, so-called because he had apparently witnessed the betrayal of the X-Men by one of their own members. He was also thought to be the last survivor of the X-Men. Upon joining the X-Men himself, Bishop suspected Remy to be the traitor until realized that Xavier's mind and Magneto's mind spawned the corrupt psionic entity known as Onslaught.\n\nDuring Apocalypse's most recent bid for power, Gambit joined Apocalypse's side as the horseman, Death. Gambit believed that Apocalypse would be able to save the mutants, but he would be able to stop Apocalypse should he betray them.\n\nAs Death, Gambit attacked his lover Rogue and his former group X-Men. Cyclops arrived with The Avengers to stop Apocalypse and his Horsemen. Apocalypse finally lost, and seems dead for a while. Sunfire, Apocaypse's other Horseman rescued Death from battle and they escaped. Afterwards they returned to take Polaris, who had also become a Horseman of Apocalypse only to find Polaris had been injured in the last battle and was now in a coma. Death and Sunfire lost the battle and were forced to run from the X-Base. Afterwards they discussed what will happen to them without Apocalypse. During their conversation, Mr. Sinister found them and they joined his Marauders.\n\nAs Death, Gambit regretted attacking Rogue. Sinister rescued him from his Death form, leaving Gambit feeling betrayed by the X-Men and indebted to Sinister. In the end, Gambit decided to stay with Sinister. The Marauders waited for the right time to attack the X-Men, with Gambit at the Marauders' side. During the battle, Mystique betrayed the X-Men and shot her step-daughter Rogue, Gambit's lover. They then took Rogue and ran. The Marauders had won the first battle.\n\nAfter that, Gambit and Sunfire attacked Cable. Cable lost and was thought to be killed by Gambit, but Cable was in fact not dead.\n\nThe X-Men went to the Marauders for the baby where Wolverine injured Gambit, and learned the baby Messiah was actually with Cable. Upon learning the Marauders had no idea where the baby was, it was surmised Gambit assisted Cable in taking her.\n\nWhen Bishop attacked Cable, Gambit rescued the baby, but as he returned to Sinister, he discovered Mystique killed him. Gambit felt as if he was finally free, and when Mystique used the baby to try to heal Rogue, Gambit saved baby again. Professor X and Cable came to take child, so Gambit gave the baby to them. Rogue was healed, and even though she wanted to kill Mystique, she didn't. Rogue's final request of Gambit was that he didn't follow her.\n\nThe Acolytes kidnapped Xavier's body, and Exodus healed him to lead them, but Xavier declined the offer. Xavier, with the help of Eric Magnus Lehnsherr, defeated Exodus at the cost of losing his memories after Bishop shot him. When Xavier's life was again threatened, Gambit had followed and saved him. Charles, didn't remember Remy, but he used his telepathic powers on Remy and saw many images locked inside his mind. Soon another group of attackers assaulted the duo, and Sebastian Shaw came to their rescue. Somehow, something done to Xavier in his past by Mr. Sinister caused Xavier to take on his personality and abilities. A Doctor Mueller tried to take Sinister's power from Charles, and even with Gambit and Shaw's help, it was unsuccessful. Gambit found Professor X's body, but it's not Xaiver anymore - the Professor changed to Nathaniel Essex (Mr Sinister).",

      "biography": "Remy LeBeau was adopted into the Thieves Guild of New Orleans as a young child. By the time he was a young adult he was considered one of the Guild's best and brightest. The leader of the Thieves Guild, Candra, joined forces with Apocalypse and became one of his Horsemen. This only marked her for attacks during the Horsemen's War of Succession and she was murdered by Holocaust.    Gambit fled and hid in the ruins of New Orleans. He found himself caught in the middle of a battle between Magneto's X-Men and a small band of Apocalypse's Infinite soldiers. Gambit could have slipped away quietly but he chose to help the X-Men and saved the life of Magneto, preventing Alex Summers from killing him with a plasma blast.Magneto invited Gambit to join the X-Men and the two became close friends.

He left the X-Men and formed his own small band of thieves, the X-ternals. Gambit's new team stole from mutants and helped humans.When Magneto discovered the possible existence of a better reality than the Age of Apocalypse, he summoned Gambit and asked him to steal the M'Kraan Crystal, the Nexus of all Realities.

      "biography": "Remy \"Gambit\" LeBeau had a hard upbringing: his father abused him, and he fell into the clutches of an abusive man who trained him as a pickpocket. As a young adult, he fell under the influence of sinister scientist Nathaniel Essex, who controlled him by threatening a woman Remy loved. Remy eventually ended up living in an abandoned subway car beneath New York, performing card tricks for money. One day, he was approached by a young girl who had witnessed a crooked cop named Hammerhead murder her mother; seeing he could perform \"magic\", she asked Remy to bring her mother back to life. Gambit took her in while he tried to figure out what to do, but Hammerhead snatched her while Gambit slept, sparing LeBeau since his boss Silvermane owed Essex a favor. Gambit tracked Hammerhead down, and,in a savage fight, blew up the top of Hammerhead's metal skull. Gambit rescued the girl and entrusted her to a homeless shelter, feeling she was not safe around him. Gambit later began losing control of his powers, charging objects unintentionally. The Von Struckers, mutant capitalists who owned Fenris International, fixed his powers in return for his services as a corporate spy. Wishing to recruit the X-Men Rogue, they sent Gambit to kidnap her from Coney Island fairground. After battling her fellow X-Men (notably blowing most of Wolverine's face off), Gambit delivered Rogue to the von Struckers' penthouse, where she stole a kiss from him, thus absorbing his powers and witnessing glimpses of his brutal past. The von Struckers gave her a special suit to control her powers, but she still rejected their job offer. When the von Struckers refused to accept this, Gambit angrily backed her up. Working together, Rogue and Gambit overcame the von Struckers and fought their way out through Fenris' Wolfpack guards. They were confronted at the building exit by Wolverine, eager for a rematch, but Rogue stopped the fight before Gambit wanted to finish it. The other X-Men had also come to rescue her, but Rogue explained that she had decided to remain with Gambit, and the pair departed.\nThey worked their way across the States, robbing Fenris holdings along the way, until they ended up in Las Vegas. The super-criminal Juggernaut, looking for Rogue, challenged them outside the Fenris Resort and Casino. Gambit battled him, eventually bringing a construction site down on both their heads. Rogue dug the injured Gambit out, then flew Gambit to the nearest hospital. Until Juggernaut is stopped and Rogue is safe, Gambit won't rest.",

      "biography": "Before the Roman’s occupied Briton and Gaul, the Druid Derwyddon was punished by his gods for a lapse of faith, swept overboard to sleep in the depths, until he finally washed ashore to discover that in his absence his religion had been replaced by Christianity. Grieving and enraged, he came upon a church built on a site of old pagan power, rich in absorbed mystical energy. Derwyddon brought the gargoyles on it to life, sending them out to wreak vengeance, but witnessing the carnage they wrought, he came to his senses, withdrawing the spell, returning most of them to stone. A few escaped. One of them was eventually ensorcelled as a mage’s familiar, from whom it learned much of the black arts; after seventy years of servitude, it slew its master. It spent the next few centuries stalking the innocent, eventually assembling human worshippers, and in modern times, came to the attention of the demonic Six-Fingered Hand. The gargoyle sought to join their number as an equal, but was treated as a slave, and when it rebelled, they punished it.Isaac Christians was born in Christiansboro, Virginia, a town founded by his ancestors. His life was full of regrets. As a child he accidentally pushed his brother Jeremiah off the roof to his death during a game. Stricken with guilt, Isaac built an emotional shell around himself, gradually emerging years later thanks to his friends, Elaine Willoughby and Buster Henderson; they called themselves the “Three Musketeers”, and while Buster was Isaac’s idol, Elaine was his first crush. When Buster became engaged to Elaine, Isaac was devastated. Soon after America entered the First World War; Buster swiftly signed up. Isaac followed soon after, but panicked when a sniper’s bullet killed a comrade on his first day in the trenches. Fleeing, Isaac ran into Buster, but soon saw him cut down by a hail of German gunfire while Isaac froze in terror. After the war Isaac abandoned his hometown and its memories. He traveled to Paris, where he became obsessed with Germaine, a prostitute bearing an uncanny resemblance to Elaine. Eventually, when she left him, Isaac resumed his travels, finally reaching Hyderabad, India, where for two years he became a follower of the holy man Vishnu Dass, gradually regaining his faith. His journey ended with a letter informing him his father had died; Isaac returned home to take on his familial responsibilities, spending decades as Christiansboro’s mayor until he retired.Increasingly upset at Christiansboro’s decline into poverty, Isaac read old books on magic, then summoned up Avarrish, one of the Six-Fingered Hand, who promised to save Christiansboro if Isaac would temporarily serve him. Agreeing, Isaac found himself in the body of the gargoyle, and was sent to kidnap Patsy Walker (Hellcat), nearly killing her housekeeper Dolly Donahue in the execution of this task. Isaac carried out a ceremony to make Patsy a demonic host; when her Defenders teammates arrived, he led a horde of demons against them, but because he tried to warn them off rather than slay them, Avarrish trapped him in the gargoyle body. After Hellcat was exorcised, the Defenders confronted the penitent Isaac; wishing to atone, he joined their ranks as Gargoyle, fighting other pawns of the Hand, including Dracula, Gordski and his undead legions, Asmodeus Jones, David Kessler and the Man-Thing, before finally confronting the true powers behind the group, an alliance of Hell Lords. Patsy, previously resentful towards him, finally forgave him in light of her own experiences during this battle, forging an enduring friendship; Isaac also became increasingly close to the recovered Dolly, finding their similar ages gave them much in common.Isaac remained with the Defenders, battling the Serpent-Men and attending the funeral of Captain Marvel, but became increasingly depressed by his perceived failure to save Christiansboro. Alongside the Defenders, he returned home to find the town full of ghostly apparitions. While Isaac was haunted by visions of his family, other specters overwhelmed the Defenders; fleeing the taunting ghosts, Isaac found his friends under attack from Null the Living Darkness, and used his own lifeforce to drive it off. The exhausted Gargoyle, near death, was saved by his family’s ghosts; having not been conjured by Null, they replenished him and informed him of their love, restoring his will to live.The next few months saw Isaac battle alongside the Defenders against the Secret Empire and the Enchantress, fight the Avengers as a pawn in the alien Supernalia’s feud against her estranged husband Nebulon, and travel to Earth-712 to free the Squadron Supreme from Null the Living Darkness’ new pawn, the Overmind. En route home, Isaac, Valkyrie, Beast and Namor took an extradimensional detour to the bizarre reality Here; dubbed “They” by the locals, the group obtained the Ruby Sneakers from the evil Lord Mayor Easy-Read the First to get home. While his relationship with Dolly slowly blossomed into love, Isaac took part in the Grandmaster’s Contest of Champions, joined other heroes in congratulating the Hulk on his pardon, and battled the Miracle Man after he stole the Son of Satan’s darksoul. Soon after Isaac attended the wedding of Daimon and Patsy, fighting agents of the Secret Empire who interrupted the nuptials. Following the Beast’s renovation of the team, the Defenders continued their vendetta with the Secret Empire and relocated to New Mexico. Magically kidnapped by an Afghan wizard for use as a familiar, Isaac was trapped within a pentagram-inscribed orb, until he tricked the wizard into coming to America, where the Defenders managed to free him. Drawn home by Elaine’s death, Isaac met the gargoyle’s spirit now wearing his old body. He allowed it to swap their forms, but the Gargoyle and its surviving fellows went on a rampage. Derwyddon, who had been tracking down the gargoyles, helped Isaac overcome his feelings of failure; after Derwyddon turned the other gargoyles to stone, Isaac reclaimed his demonic form, then slew his old body which again hosted the gargoyle’s spirit. During a subsequent visit to Dr. Strange’s house, Isaac was drawn to steal a crystal without knowing why; sometime later a possessed Moondragon ripped out Isaac’s soul and turned his gargoyle body into her pawn, warping it into an even more monstrous visage. Several of the Defenders, aided by the Interloper, sacrificed themselves, using their lifeforces to turn it, Moondragon and themselves to dust.Isaac’s unbound spirit entered the crystal he had taken from Strange’s sanctum, which was found by a soldier involved in the clean-up after the battle. Isaac controlled the soldier, tracking down Moondragon’s still active spirit, catching up with her when she made contact with her cousin Pamela Douglas. Moondragon convinced Isaac to accompany her and Pamela to Titan, where the Eternals grew Moondragon a new body. For his part, Isaac hung round Pamela’s neck, until she became Sundragon, using her new powers to give him a new body, capable of changing between human and gargoyle forms. While Moondragon returned to Earth, Isaac left for deep space with Sundragon, Cloud and the Titanian Eternal Demeityr, but was captured by the Stranger. Eventually Isaac escaped the Stranger’s Lab World with many of the other inmates and returned to Earth.Isaac sought out Dolly, resuming their relationship, but after she died of old age he moved in with Patsy and Daimon Hellstrom at their mansion at Fire Lake, Massachusetts. Having lost his darksoul Daimon began to die; Patsy worked with Isaac to summon “Satan” to help his son, but the sight of Daimon’s true, demonic face drove Patsy insane. Isaac stayed on to care for Patsy, and tried to keep Daimon from straying too far. Even after Patsy’s suicide, and disapproving of Daimon’s new consort, Jaine Cutter, Isaac felt he had nowhere else to go. He eventually managed to stop viewing Jaine as Patsy’s replacement, and they became friends. Isaac later returned to Christiansboro, summoned by the sorceress Seetah, who sent him to find the Silver Surfer, but en route he was taken over by the Coroner. Overpowered and freed by the Surfer, they confronted the Coroner, who turned Isaac to stone; Seetah later made him flesh again, informing him he still had a quest to fulfill. It is unclear whether he has completed this quest or not, but he was recently seen back at Fire Lake when the Thunderbolts visited.",

      "biography": "Gazer met the X-Men when a massive Golgotha invasion threatened Earth. He was permanently stationed alone on NASA Space Station Eight, because due to his mutant abilities, he was the only person to withstand the high levels of radiation. Upon detecting the impending psychic alien creatures, he alerted Emma Frost of their approach. The X-Men soon joined him on his observation platform as a staging post for battling the Golgotha.Following the events of House of M|\"M-Day,\", Gazer was one of the many mutants who lost their abilities. He soon contracted radiation sickness. After losing sanity and hope, Gazer jumped out of the station in his space suit, claiming if he's going to die, he's going to die \"out there.\" Just as soon as he made peace with his death, a blinding light appeared and he found himself before Apocalypse.Apocalypse thrust him into a battle to the death with an egyptologist for the honor of becoming his Horseman, War. Gazer was overpowered, and before he was dealt the final blow, Ozymandias saved him and told him he would one day repay the debt, as the scribe was planning to overthrow Apocalypse. During Gazer's transformation, Apocalypse denied him painkillers, stating that the pain was a part of the process of becoming War. After it was complete, Sunfire tried to free him and escape, but it was too late. Gazer was gone, and in his place there was War, a loyal Horseman.While Apocalypse was recruiting the 198, a band of mutant refugees outside the Xavier Institute, War demolished the unmanned Sentinels standing guard. Ozymandias soon grew tired of Apocalypse's plans and approached War to aid him and repay his debt. However, the loyal Horseman relayed the scribe's traitorous plans to his master. The X-Men had Sunfire in their custody, who was now the Horseman, Famine. War broke into the mansion to retrieve him, was met with significant resistance, and forced to retreat.With Apocalypse's Sphinx threatening the United Nations, and the Avengers and the X-Men storming the ship, War stayed at his master's side. However, Ozymandias snuck up behind him and ran a battle axe through his chest for denying him his repayment.",

      "biography": "The story of the Ghost Rider began over twenty thousand years ago, when the immortals known as the Blood allied themselves with the original Spirits of Vengeance in a war against a soul-stealing demon named Zarathos. To win this war, the Blood created the mystical Medallion of Power, which housed the assembled power of the Spirits of Vengeance. A portion of Zarathos became trapped in this Medallion, too, leading the Blood to decide that the artifact was too powerful to be kept intact. The Medallion was broken into shards and placed into the spiritual bloodlines of two families, both of which would be overseen and protected by a Blood named Caretaker.  This arrangement lasted until the 1700s, when young Noble Kale of the spiritual bloodline fell in love with a woman named Magdalena. Fearing the reaction from his fire-and-brimstone pastor father, Noble hid his romance. When Magdalena bore him a child, however, Pastor Kale had Magdalena branded a witch and burned at the stake. As she died, she cursed Pastor Kale, invoking the legendary Furies to seek vengeance in her name, and these ancient spirits went on a destructive rampage. Pastor Kale sought aid from the demon Mephisto, offering Noble's soul as payment. Mephisto recognized the Medallion shard within Noble Kale and activated it, transforming the young man into a living Spirit of Vengeance, a Ghost Rider. Noble defeated the Furies and then turned on his own father, who slew Noble's son as a sacrificial offering to Ghost Rider. A horrified Noble tried to commit suicide, but Mephisto appeared, seeking to claim his soul. An angelic being named Uriel intervened, stating Noble's soul belonged in Heaven. It was decided that Noble's soul belonged to neither Heaven nor Hell, but would instead be consigned to the void, to be summoned forth by his descendants. He inhabited the first-born child of each generation, with documented occurrences during World War I and the lifetime of Naomi Kale, the birth mother of Dan Ketch and his siblings. Fearing for her children, Naomi left Dan and his sister Barbara with Francis Ketch in Cypress Hills, New York. Her oldest son was left with his father while she unsuccessfully attempted to end the curse.Dan and Barbara grew up in a happy and stable home, befriending local girl Stacy Dolan, who was the daughter of a local police officer and, later, the object of Dan's romantic affections. As Dan matured, he became interested in motorcycles and drawn to the open road. When Dan and Barb took a shortcut home through Cypress Hills Cemetery, they stumbled upon the criminal Deathwatch as he killed a man over canisters of bio-toxin. Barb's screams alerted Deathwatch and his minions, who shot her in the chest with an arrow. Dan carried her into a nearby junkyard, seeking escape, and noticed a pristine-looking motorcycle parked in the center of the debris. Drawn to it, Dan touched its gas cap, his fingers dripping with his sister's innocent blood. The blood's contact with the gas cap ignited a mystical transformation, changing Dan Ketch into the Spirit of Vengeance known as the Ghost Rider. Ghost Rider rushed Barbara to a hospital, but her severe wounds left her in a deep coma. Enraged, Dan embraced his new power and its mission of vengeance. Whenever innocent blood was spilled, Dan transformed into the Ghost Rider and used his powers - especially his dreaded Penance Stare - to mete out justice. At first, Ghost Rider focused on finding the now-missing bio-toxin, which had become the crux of an ongoing war between Deathwatch and the Kingpin of Crime. Ghost Rider and Deathwatch's pseudo-vampiric minion Blackout clashed repeatedly over the canisters, which had been found and hidden in the cemetery by the Cypress Hills Jokers gang. During a final battle over the canisters, the contents of which could have wiped out most of the Tri-State Area, Blackout started to unseal them but was interrupted by the Ghost Rider. The pseudo-vampire tried to sink his artificial teeth into Ghost Rider's neck, but the hero's flaming skull badly burned him and drove him mad. Blackout fled, but Dan was now certain of his role as the Ghost Rider and swore to his comatose sister that he would continue fighting crime.This proved to be a costly vow for Dan. Shortly after turning his Penance Stare on a group of criminals, Dan decided that no one deserved such torment - not even lawbreakers. He had his friend Jack D'Auria lock up the bike, but he was soon pressed into using it again when Mr. Hyde went on a rampage. Shortly thereafter, journalist Linda Wei began campaigning against the Ghost Rider, equating him with other vigilantes such as the Punisher. Dan disliked the comparison, especially after teaming with the Punisher against the anarchist Flag-Smasher. Ghost Rider refused to allow the Punisher to kill their foe, saying he served vengeance, not death.  After teaming with Spider-Man, the Hulk and Wolverine to form a temporary substitute Fantastic Four, he aided Wolverine and Brass  in tracking down Deathwatch, who had kidnapped Watanbe's sister in a power play against the Mandarin. Barbara Ketch had stabilized by this time, but remained comatose. The stress of recent events built a wall between Dan and Stacy. When Blackout uncovered Dan's secret identity, he slew Barbara in her hospital bed. A traumatized Dan took out his rage on the insane Scarecrow, who had gone on a killing spree to draw out his old foe, Captain America.A guilt-stricken Dan found his life becoming increasingly complicated. Blackout continued to target those close to Dan, slaying blind street vendor Mr. Larsen and the priest at Mrs. Ketch's church. A local parents group blamed Ghost Rider for a series of child abductions and hired an all-female mercenary group called H.E.A.R.T. to stop him. They ambushed Ghost Rider in the tunnels inhabited by the mutant Morlocks, who were involved in the child abductions. With the aid of the original X-Factor, Ghost Rider was able to resolve the crisis, though the media continued to portray him as a menace. He encountered Thor, then fought the murderer Zodiak, after which Ghost Rider was kidnapped and separated from Dan by Nightmare, who believed him to be Zarathos. Nightmare force-fed Ghost Rider memories of Zarathos, but was shocked when the Rider rejected them as not his own. Dan and Ghost Rider re-merged and escaped Nightmare's realm, only to find themselves trapped by Doctor Strange and his associate Rintrah, who also believed Ghost Rider to be Zarathos. Ghost Rider convinced Strange of his error and aided the mage in exorcising a demon from his ally, Topaz. Ghost Rider joined the Moon Knight against Plasma and her Knights of the Moon, aided Spider-Man in rescuing young Adam from the Hobgoblin, and briefly assisted the resurrected warriors known as Shadow Riders against the demon-forces of the megalomaniacal Mys-Tech.The arrival of John Blaze led to even more turmoil. The former Ghost Rider used a binding ritual to trap Dan, whom he believed to be Zarathos. However, an explosion of Hellfire leaped from Ghost Rider and into Blaze via his shotgun. This freed Dan, but also enabled Blaze to discharge Hellfire through the gun, badly wounding Ghost Rider. When he realized that slaying Ghost Rider would mean killing Dan - whom he now viewed as an innocent - Blaze relented. Convinced the entity within Dan was not Zarathos, but knowing what the younger man was going through, Blaze acted as Dan's protector from then on. Blaze and the Ghost Rider aided the extraterrestrials Gun Runner and the Enhanced, freeing prisoners of the alien religious fanatics known as the Cynodd. Ghost Rider also began trying to repair Dan's personal life, freeing Francis Ketch from the new Sin-Eater (Reverend Styge), who was preying on her suffering over her lost daughter. Ghost Rider then assisted Cloak and Dagger against a plot of the demon D'spayre, aided Quasar and others against the forces of Maelstrom, teamed with the Punisher against the immense traveling drug-dealing fortress the Roaring Island, fought the Hand alongside Daredevil, and joined the mutant Cable, clashing with the subterranean cult the Grateful Undead. The Ghost Rider was summoned alongside the Punisher and Wolverine to the town of Christ's Crown by Blackheart to slay his father Mephisto, but the trio fought off both demons, saving the young empath Lucy Crumm in the process; Lucy later summoned the trio to again banish Blackheart. Ghost Rider's near-constant battles continued. He fought against the likes of Zodiak; Mephisto's pawn Suicide; Spider-Man's foes the Sinister Six; Nightmare; the alien Sleepwalker; Deathwatch's agents Hag, Troll, and Snowblind; the demon Gorn; the werewolf cult the Braineaters; and the demon D'Kay and his Legion of Vengeance.Dan sought revenge on Blackout, who tore out his throat. A transformation into Ghost Rider saved Dan's life, but left him unable to switch back. Trapped in a void, he was barely able to converse with Ghost Rider. During one of their shared visions, Ghost Rider saw a series of individuals capable of stopping the ancient demoness Lilith, Mother of Demons (Lilin), from tearing the walls between dimensions. Ghost Rider teamed with John Blaze and the mysterious Caretaker to assemble these beings, who became the Midnight Sons. Around this same time, he journeyed to New Orleans to track down a group of alien Brood. Ghost Rider was briefly possessed by a Brood during this time, but Dan Ketch - while floating in the void - was able to resist the alien's control. Aided by John Blaze and the X-Men, Ghost Rider slew the Brood Queen.After Doctor Strange helped restore Dan to normal, Dan began re-evaluating his work as Ghost Rider. He felt he was a force for good, but he also wanted to have a normal life again. This desire intensified after his mother revealed that both he and Barbara had been adopted. Ghost Rider and Blaze continued to work well together, though their methods sometimes clashed. The two of them united with Spider-Man in an attempt to capture both Venom and a group of Deathspawn seeking the resurrection of Deathwatch. Soon after, Lilith allied herself with Centurious, an old foe of the John Blaze Ghost Rider. Together, the two mystics kidnapped Dan's mother and stole Ghost Rider's enchanted chain, forging it into a weapon for Centurious. Ghost Rider badly injured Centurious during one of their clashes, unwittingly unleashing Zarathos, who had been lurking inside Centurious ever since their imprisonment in the Crystal of Souls. Zarathos mated with Lilith and schemed to resurrect the Fallen, a group of his former followers. At this point, Caretaker disclosed the true origins of the Medallion of Power and revealed that Dan and John were brothers. Armed with this new knowledge, Ghost Rider confronted Zarathos in a battle that seemingly destroyed them both, though Ghost Rider reconstituted himself weeks later, just prior to the murder of John Blaze's wife, Roxanne, by Anton Hellgate. Dan moved into a new apartment and began taking control of his life. While Ghost Rider was plagued by Blackheart, Dan broke up with Stacy and sought more answers about Ghost Rider's origins. With the aid of Doctor Strange, Dan discovered that he was related to the young sorceress Jennifer Kale. Jennifer mystically unlocked Ghost Rider's memories, restoring his knowledge of the family curse. This greatly lightened Ghost Rider's spirit, especially after Jennifer Kale mystically caused many of Dan's friends and relatives to forget his secret identity. At last aware of his past as Noble Kale, Ghost Rider began working with Dan on a much more intuitive basis, helping his human host reconcile with Stacy. He also teamed with Brother Voodoo and Dracula's daughter, Lilith, to repel another attack by the Scarecrow, who had gained the power to inhabit other bodies and had summoned the decaying corpse of Barbara Ketch as part of his plan.  Ghost Rider had a brief clash with Daredevil during this time, coming to blows over their differing methods in capturing a psychotic killer.Blackheart later created his own Spirits of Vengeance - Wallow, Doghead, Verminous Rex and Pao Fu. They invited Noble to join them, killing him when he refused. Noble's soul was cast into Hell, where Blackheart sought to corrupt him by offering to restore Noble's mortal form and lift the family curse, in exchange for Noble's pledge to marry both Pao Fu and the mysterious Black Rose, secretly a resurrected Roxanne Blaze. Noble agreed, but Dan was unwilling. Now fully separated from Ghost Rider, Dan was guided through Hell by the spirit of Naomi Kale, and was killed after revealing that Noble's true destiny was to become the Angel of Death. Utilizing the powers that came with this title, Ghost Rider slew Blackheart and assumed the throne of Hell. He then resurrected Dan and sent him back to Earth as a way of thanking him for their years together.Noble's tenure in Hell was a brief one. He subtly aided Jack Russell, the Werewolf, in tracking down a serial killer, but was forced out of Hell when a coup occurred. Injured and confused, Noble wandered the streets of New York City, his Hellfire raging out of control. This attracted the attention of Spider-Man, who tried to bring his old ally under control, with limited success. Dan arrived at the scene and realized that Noble's powers were fluctuating because he lacked a human host. The two men were forced to merge again and are currently seeking more innocents to avenge.At some point after merging with Kale again, Daniel must have changed his mind about being host to the Ghost Rider because he chose to have it expelled from his body. He contacted a woman by the name of Mary LeBow, a paranormal consultant, and she separated the two by way of an exorcism. Then, two years later, Ketch decided he can't live without that part of him anymore and will do anything to get it back. Daniel gets his wish when an agent of Zadkiel known only as Mister Eleven comes to him and tell him he can have his abilities restored. Ketch only got a taste of it at first and immediately became addicted to the power. Dan wanted more and more, but he would only be allowed to sample a little at a time, until he decided to become an agent of Zadkiel too. Daniel was shown an ugly side of the Ghost Rider where the hosts can become mindless beasts if the spirit inside takes control of them. He was made to believe he'd be doing them a service by taking their powers from them and return them to Heaven where they originated from. The only downside was some of the hosts may not survive the process - such was the case of Shoba Mirza - but Ketch still felt he was truly helping even if that was the end result. What Daniel didn't know is Zadkiel wanted the powers of the Ghost Riders, so he could take control of Heaven. The current road Daniel has chosen to take led him on a collision course with Johnny Blaze, and several other Spirits of Vengeance throughout the world. Ketch managed to defeat all the Ghost Riders, including Blaze, and delivered their power to his master. As soon as the deed was done, Ketch was cast out of Heaven, aware of Zadkiel's plans, but he managed to take some of the power back with him. Nevertheless, it was too late to stop Zadkiel from winning his war.Ketch, Blaze and the new Caretaker went their separate ways, but Daniel felt more cursed than ever. Finally seeing the error of his ways, Ketch wished he would have left the Ghost Rider behind instead of being made a fool by Zadkiel. For helping lay waste to Heaven, Daniel had become a slave to vengeance, unable to ignore the cries of the innocent. His first mission was to find the malicious Highwayman and avenge the lives of those unfortunate enough to cross his path. Daniel would soon get another crack at Zadkiel, but first he would make a deal with the devil to keep the Antichrist safe in exchange for the keys to Heaven. Traveling to New York and meeting up with Blaze, Sara, Hellstorm and Jaine Cutter, Daniel told them of his agreement and he and Blaze took off in search of the doorway to Heaven. The road would not be easy as an attack from Big Wheel and Trull slowed them greatly, allowing Blackout to steal the key. Ketch and Blaze had to find another way to reach their goal and the lair of the Gun Nuns held the answer. On arrival, the Ghost Riders had to contend with the new Orb and a new Vengeance, but neither proved to be too much of a problem. Zadkiel was another story. Upon reaching Heaven and confronting the mad angel, Ketch and Blaze were tossed aside like insignificant specks. If it wasn't for the emergence of an army of Ghost Riders, they may never have beaten their tormentor. Not only that, but Ketch and the other Spirits of Vengeance fought off an attack by the Antichrist and his minions when they invaded Heaven. The holy city, now back in God's hands, was safe, and the two brothers were sent back to Earth. Ketch challenged Blaze to a race, and the two sped off with Sara not far behind.",

The couple worked as scientists at S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Super-Soldier Research Facility under Bruce Banner, in whose scientific shadow Hank lived uneasily. Fearful of anti-mutant prejudice, the self-shrinking, insect-powered Jan concealed her mutant nature, eventually allowing Hank to take credit for creating her powers by scientific means.

The Forgotten &nbsp;One &nbsp;obeyed &nbsp;this &nbsp;command &nbsp;until &nbsp;he &nbsp;was &nbsp;informed &nbsp;by &nbsp;Sprite&nbsp;that all the other Eternals were absent while their enemies, the Deviants, attempted to launch an assault upon the Celestials, the creators of both Deviants &nbsp;and &nbsp;Eternals. &nbsp;The &nbsp;Forgotten &nbsp;One &nbsp;set &nbsp;into &nbsp;space, &nbsp;stopped &nbsp;the &nbsp;Deviants, and was then taken aboard the Celestials' Mothership by the One Above All, leader of the Celestials.\n\nThe Forgotten One was christened “Hero” by the One Above All, and was returned to Earth to warn the Eternals not to interfere with the Celestials. He was welcomed back to Olympia by Zuras, and soon walked again in man’s world. The Forgotten One was one of the Eternals who elected to remain on Earth when most of the population departed to explore space. He aided his fellow Eternals against the Deviants’ attempt to revive the Dreaming &nbsp;Celestial, &nbsp;a &nbsp;rogue &nbsp;Celestial. &nbsp;When &nbsp;demons &nbsp;commanded &nbsp;by &nbsp;N’Astirh &nbsp;assaulted &nbsp;New &nbsp;York, &nbsp;the &nbsp;Forgotten &nbsp;One &nbsp;journeyed &nbsp;there &nbsp;to &nbsp;slay &nbsp;them, &nbsp;and &nbsp;wound &nbsp;up &nbsp;joining &nbsp;the &nbsp;Avengers &nbsp;at &nbsp;the &nbsp;end &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;crisis, &nbsp;resuming his alias as Gilgamesh.Gilgamesh &nbsp;did &nbsp;not &nbsp;last &nbsp;long &nbsp;as &nbsp;an &nbsp;Avenger, &nbsp;eventually &nbsp;succumbing &nbsp;to &nbsp;battle &nbsp;fury &nbsp;while &nbsp;combating &nbsp;the &nbsp;Lava &nbsp;Men, &nbsp;an &nbsp;error &nbsp;that &nbsp;nearly &nbsp;led &nbsp;to &nbsp;his death at their hands.

      "biography": "The fiercely proud Gladiator is the leader, or praetor, of the Imperial Guard, a multi-ethnic group of super-powered alien beings who act as enforcers of the laws of the Shi'ar Empire.  Gladiator was amongst the first of the Imperial Guard encountered by the team of superhuman mutant adventurers known as the X-Men who sought to rescue the Princess-Majestrix Lilandra from her insane brother, then-Majestor D'Ken.  Following the orders of their emperor, the Guard clashed with the X-Men and were on the verge of winning when the band of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers arrived to turn the tide of battle in the X-Men's favor.The Guard and the X-Men subsequently clashed once more when the Shi'ar sought to end the threat to the universe posed by the cosmic entity known as the Phoenix, which had assumed the form of X-Men member Jean Grey.  As praetor of the Guard, Gladiator was an obvious choice to be one of eight Guardsmen chosen to battle the X-Men.  The Guard defeated the X-Men on this occasion, but the mutants were allowed to return to Earth after Phoenix seemingly committed suicide.Gladiator was later amongst those few Imperial Guard members who opposed the treacherous Shi'ar High Council member Lord Samédàr who was aiding an attempted coup of the Shi'ar throne by Deathbird.  Even after many of the Guard chose to side with Samédàr, Gladiator remained steadfast in his loyalty to then-Empress Lilandra.Later, Gladiator travelled to Earth in an effort to capture a spaceship of renegade members of the shape-changing alien Skrulls. Mistakenly thinking the Skrulls had disguised themselves as members of the world-famous Fantastic Four, Gladiator attacked and defeated the super-hero family.  When the Skrulls, posing as X-Men, then appeared, Gladiator was irritated on having his \"friends\" attack him.  Together with the help of the web-slinging Spider-Man and the super-soldier named Captain America, the Skrulls treachery was exposed and they were quickly captured by Gladiator.\nWhen the formerly-exiled Deathbird had usurped the Shi'ar throne from her sister Lilandra in a successful coup, Gladiator was forced to swear fealty to his new empress, even though his loyalties still lay with Lilandra.  However, Gladiator's sense of duty saw him continue to serve as the Guard's praetor, despite his personal feelings about his new empress.Soon after, when a member of an alien race that had been forced to join the Shi'ar Empire came into possession of armor belonging to the Spaceknight of Galador, the Imperial Guard mistakenly attacked the Spaceknight named Rom.  After the misunderstanding was made clear, Rom and Gladiator teamed up to face the culprit, and Gladiator came to realize that even though the Shi'ar provides their conquered species with everything, they lack one important thing - freedom.Gladiator subsequently led the Imperial Guard against the British team of costumed adventurers known as Excalibur and the team of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers over the fate of the then-bearer of the cosmic Phoenix Force, the alternate future daughter of the X-Man Jean Grey named Rachel Summers, whose power Deathbird sought for herself.  After Deathbird was struck down whilst siphoning Phoenix's power, Gladiator ordered the Guard to retreat, thus robbing Deathbird of the chance to become supremely powerful.Much later, the intergalactic teleporter Lila Cheney transported the X-Men to the Shi'ar Empire at the behest of then-Empress Deathbird in time to see Lilandra regain her throne.  Not all was as it seemed, however, as in reality a group of Warskrulls, using technology to allow them to duplicate superpowers, had captured and impersonated Xavier, using his telepathy to control Lilandra and the Imperial Guard, including Gladiator.  After the ruse was discovered by the X-Men and all the Warskrull impostors were exposed, Lilandra settled matters with Deathbird, discovering her sister did not want the throne anymore.During the war between the Shi'ar and Kree Empires, Gladiator sought to stop the team of super-powered Earth beings known as the Avengers from becoming embroiled in the conflict.  He clashed with both the ionic energy-powered Wonder Man and the Norse god of thunder, Thor.  However, Gladiator had met his match with Thor, who brutally rendered Gladiator unconscious and then hurled him through one of the Shi'ar's transportational stargates, sealing it behind him.When Lilandra learned of the many Earth heroes that had sacrificed their lives to stop the malevolent psionic being named Onslaught, she dispatched eight members of the Imperial Guard, including Gladiator, to protect Earth.  While on Earth, the Guard uncovered a plot by a militant Kree faction to simulate a radical political activist group in revenge for Earth's involvement in the Kree/Shi'ar war.  In reality, the group created a \"nega-reactor\", similar to the bomb that was used on the Kree.  However, this plot was stopped by the Guard, but not before the reactor was used by the Kree's leader, the Supreme Intelligence, to re-incorporate itself after being presumably killed at the end of the war.During their brief stay on Earth, Gladiator and his fellow Guardsman Oracle learned that a fugitive from Shi'ar justice was hiding on the planet, stuck in the form of a child and with no memory of his former life.  Their search brought them into confrontation with the gamma-spawned man-beast known as the incredible Hulk.Subsequently, Gladiator was amongst those Imperial Guard members who defended Lilandra against an assassination attempt by the Kree Ronan the Accuser and his unwilling agents, the royal family of the Earth race known as the Inhumans.\nAfter his Empress Lilandra, under the mental control of Charles Xavier's mutant twin sister Cassandra Nova, had ordered the destruction of all mutants on Earth, Gladiator led the assault team that attacked the X-Men's mansion home. Defeating both Wolverine and the Beast, Gladiator was halted by the arrival of his fellow Guardsman Smasher who managed to convince the Guard of the true threat.  Together, the Guard and the X-Men managed to defeat Nova and free Lilandra.Gladiator recently returned to Earth under the command of Empress Lilandra in a mission to capture the cosmic Uni-Power and bring it back for evaluation. After a battle with the Invisible Woman of the Fantastic Four, who had been possessed by the Uni-Power and transformed into Captain Universe, the Uni-Power transferred over to Gladiator so he could rush the Invisible Woman to Los Angeles to help prevent an impending tsunami. Afterwards, Gladiator invited the Uni-Power back to the Shi'ar Empire as their guest. The Uni-Power accepted; however, en route they were captured by Krosakis, an energy consuming warlord, who forced the Uni-Power into his body to become a corrupt Captain Universe. Drained of his energy, Gladiator and others could only watch as Krosakis toiled away with the Uni-Power. However, the Silver Surfer sensed the Uni-Power's distress and, following a prolonged battle with Krosakis, saved the Uni-Power and Krosakis' prisoners. The Surfer, imbued with the Captain Universe powers, left for Earth while Gladiator took Krosakis to the Shi'ar Empire to stand trial.",

      "biography": "William Foster spent his childhood in the Watts ghetto. His natural intelligence and the influence of several good people helped him leave the ghetto and attend California Technical Institute, but not before enlisting in the military. He saw combat in southeast Asia, where he made an enemy of CIA operative Geoffrey Ballard, later the rogue super-agent known as the Centurion. As a student, Foster worked toward a degree in biochemistry and met and married Claire Temple, a medical student. Upon graduation, he worked his way up the corporate ladder at Stark Industries, but his drive for success strained their marriage to the point of divorce.\n\nWhen the scientific adventurer Henry Pym was trapped at a minimum of ten feet in height, Tony Stark recommended that Foster assist Pym in finding a cure. For several months they worked together in Pym's laboratories in New Jersey and the Avengers Mansion, although Foster often became embroiled in the Avengers’s cases, such as surviving attacks by the Sons of the Serpent and helping to thwart Whirlwind’s attempt to kill Pym and the Wasp in order to claim their estate. The two scientists eventually found a cure.\n\nFoster returned to Stark Industries, where he was promoted to head of the biochemistry division at Stark Industries' Los Angeles plant. Fascinated by Pym's research, Foster synthesized the growth compound, hoping to eliminate any side effects. Eventually Foster tested the formula on himself and found he had successfully duplicated Pym's growth powers. Taking a vacation from his duties at Stark Industries, Foster devised a plan by which he might win back the affection of his ex-wife, Claire Temple. He wrote her about how he had worked with Pym and duplicated his powers but deceived her into believing that, like Pym, he was also trapped at giant stature. She agreed to meet him to see what help she could provide. They met at a traveling circus where he said he had to work in order to earn money to continue his research. Foster had outfitted himself in a costume and billed himself as \"Black Goliath.\" Claire's current boyfriend, Luke Cage (then known as the hero Power Man), had followed her, and the two men fought over her. They settled their differences long enough to join forces against the Ringmaster and his Circus of Crime, which Foster had unwittingly joined. Ultimately, however, Claire chose to remain with Cage rather than her ex-husband. Ashamed, Foster returned to Los Angeles.\n\nAlthough he had fashioned a costumed identity for himself, Foster was uncertain whether he should use it to fight crime, considering the circumstances in which he fashioned it. With the encouragement of Henry Pym, he decided to try. On his first outing, Foster encountered the criminal Atom-Smasher (Ronald English), who bombarded him with deadly radiation. This bombardment immediately produced painful side effects, making his size transformations difficult and causing him to occasionally black out. Before Foster was able to defeat the Atom-Smasher, his foe was killed by a mysterious assassin that later turned out to be Atom-Smasher's brother, the second Atom-Smasher. Ignoring the symptoms of radiation poisoning, he continued his career, battling such menaces as Vulcan, the Stilt-Man, and the Hijacker, and aiding the Champions and the Thing. After some time, Foster changed his code-name to Giant-Man.\n\nWhen it became difficult to ignore his illness, Foster took a leave of absence from Stark International to come a consultant at Project: PEGASUS, an upstate New York energy research installation facility. There to do research on the corpse of the Atom-Smasher, he nearly sacrificed his life to stop the mad scheme of the Nth Man. Following the attack, a team of top radiologists were assigned to help cure his condition, including Reed Richards and Walter Langkowski. After their treatments failed, Foster returned to Los Angeles to finish his life's work with Stark Industries, only to be attacked by the new Atom-Smasher (Michael English). The Thing, Spider-Woman, and himself defeated Atom-Smasher. Spider-Woman saved his life with a transfusion of her blood, at the expense of losing her own power of immunity to radiation. However, Foster believed his cell structure had deteriorated to a point that he could never become Giant-Man again. He retired and became a full time researcher. During this time, he became a consultant to the Avengers when they opened their West Coast base.\n\nEventually, Foster found himself working as technician for the High Evolutionary at his Antarctic strong hold. Learning the High Evolutionary's plan to mutate everyone on earth, he managed to release a warning to the West Coast Avengers, who tracked him to the stronghold. But as the Avengers were being defeated, Foster swallowed a chemical that again transformed him into Giant-Man, and he learned that his cellular disintegration had been cured. He then defeated the High Evolutionary in combat. Foster declined joining the Avengers full time, returning to research.\n\nFoster renewed his research partnership with Henry Pym for a time, and with it, his occasional association with the Avengers (for instance, he assisted Pym in saving the life of the second Swordsman who was residing at the Avengers Mansion). Later, he and Pym learned of a potential invasion from the dimension of Kosmos, from which their growth powers derived. After thwarting the attempt, Foster found himself powerless once more, and he once again returned to scientific research.\n\nRestoring his growth powers and resuming his Black Goliath identity, Foster aided Black Panther, Falcon, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist against a gang of criminals; later, as Foster, he assisted the Avengers during the Red Zone crisis. Modifying his costume and adopting a new alias of Goliath, Foster teamed with the Thing to defeat Cauldron the Scalding Man. Subsequently, Foster was one of many heroes who opposed the U.S. government's Superhuman Registration Act and joined Captain America's Secret Avengers team. During a clash with Iron Man's squad of Registration Act supporters, Foster was killed by a clone of the thunder god Thor.",

      "biography": "In his searching for the \"Missing Link\", Dr. Anthony Druid journeyed to Borneo where discovered an even more startling creature - one who pointed the way to a completely different cousin of humanity, the loathsome sub-species known as the Deviants. The following events were taken from his notes.\n\nGorgilla dwelt in peace at Midnight Mountain in Borneo, a one time slave of the Deviants created from their genetic experiments. Although he resembles a 25 foot tall simian, he also possesses a natural swimming ability (hence the moniker \"Gorgilla\"). I led the expedition to Borneo that resulted in his discovery; although Gorgilla was at first wary of us humans, we were amazed when he saved the expedition party from a Tyrannosaurus Rex (later determined to be another Deviant creation), recognizing us humans as distant relations.\n\nIf only Gorgilla could have remained there in peace! Unfortunately, Warlord Kro of the Deviants arranged for him to be sent to New York City, where he cause a rampage while Kro’s communist allies planted bombs in the city. Fortunately, I had recently joined the Monster Hunters, and we were able to bring down the beast with tranquilizers and knock out gas. As the victimized creatures lay unconscious, we were able to remove the Brain Mine device which Kro had used to control him. With his free will regained, Gorgilla led us after the bombers, identifying them by their scents. Makkari, using his guise as FBI agent Jake Curtiss, arranged transport for Gorgilla back to Midnight mountain, and we accompanied our friend on his journey home. We were assaulted there by Lizard Men sent by Kro, but Gorgilla aided us in battle, and we left some of the Lizard Men under his watchful eye. As we continued on our adventure, we said our farewells to Gorgilla, and it is my fondest hope that he will remain in his paradisaic home for good.\n\n \n\nA Fantastic Tale\n\nDr. Druid and the Monster Hunters adventures with Gorilla were not his last. This next encounter comes from the journals of Reed Richards. I am afraid this will sound contrary to the departed doctor's wishes, but Gorgilla has since left Borneo for the United States - and he seems quite happy to have done so. Initially transported away from Midnight Mountain by the power of the sorcerer Yandroth to battle the Avengers, Gorgilla is perhaps the most successful of the four monsters I helped to rehabilitate here at the Baxter Building. After shrinking the giant ape down to human proportions, I taught him rudimentary English, and put him to work as a janitor. Gorgilla was pleased to have employment, and has adopted America as his new home with the eagerness of any immigrant. Although he is somewhat naive, and abetted Googam in his break-in at the Baxter Building he has made significant progress, he later aided Fin Fang Foom, Googam, and Elektro against the massive Tim Boo Ba. He was knocked onto the Statue of Liberty during the battle, and has adopted the statue as his new home, requiring the city to provide him with a constant supply of bananas. His position at the Baxter Building will remain open for him until he decides to come down.\n\n&nbsp;",

As such, he is allies with most of his family including his cousin and King, Black Bolt, his wife, Queen Medusa, Medusa’s sister Crystal, and his cousins Triton and Karnak. Gorgon’s mother, Milena, was an archivist and his father, Korath, an architect who was related to the Inhumans’ royalty.

By his teenage years, Gorgon was a close friend of his cousins in the royal family including Black Bolt, Medusa and Triton—but was closest to Karnak. Owing to his formidable strength, Gorgon took a career in the Inhumans’ militia, and although he mastered his powers responsibly, he remained short-tempered.\n\nGorgon, the Seismic Guardian\n\nGorgon’s powers are centered in his massively muscled legs and hoof-like feet; approximately three-quarters of Gorgon’s weight is in the lower half of his body.

By the time he had reached the age of four, he had established himself as one of the five greatest painters in Japan. By his sixth birthday, he had composed his first opera and attempted suicide for the second time. Around thirteen, Tomi created a mathematical formula that proved, without a doubt, the existence of God.When Tomi discovered he could turn people into stone by looking at them, he was dubbed 'the Gorgon' by the Japanese media. For four years, Gorgon ran a death cult called 'The Dawn of the White Light', and subjected Japan to a series of terrorist attacks. At 18 years old, Gorgon killed all of his friends and family and defeated the Hand's guards to prove to the Hand that he was worthy of their membership. He killed himself to fully initiate himself.Splitting from the Hand, Gorgon helped Baron Striker to unite the Hand, Hydra and AIM. Together, they created a plan to kill several of America's major super heroes and resurrect them under Hydra control. Gorgon killed the first mutant, Wolverine, and supervised the killings of various other minor villains. Gorgon also drew Elektra into a trap and killed her for the Hand, who resurrected her as a weapon.When Wolverine was captured by S.H.I.E.L.D. and returned to his normal state of mind, Gorgon took over Hydra as the Supreme Hydra. His plans to destroy the world with the machines Wolverine had stolen from Reed Richards were stopped when Elektra and Wolverine destroyed the Hand and large sections of Hydra. Gorgon himself was attacked by the two heroes. Defeating Elektra easily and impaling Logan, Gorgon went to kill the crippled head of S.H.I.E.L.D., Nick Fury. He was stopped by Wolverine, who he again easily defeated. This time, however, Gorgon tried to turn Wolverine to stone. When he took off his glasses, Wolverine unsheathed his claws. The reflection of his eyes caused the Gorgon to turn to stone. He was then killed by Logan.",

      "biography": "Ken Hale was a scholar and explorer of the 1950's who was obsessed with the idea of immortality. He learned of the legendary \"Gorilla Man,\" a half-man, half-animal monster in a remote area of Africa. If one were to kill the beast, the legend said, he would never die. Finally leaving his wife and kids to seek out the Gorilla Man, Hale ultimately couldn't kill the creature, as it was too much like a human. However, in losing his way back, he was forced to kill the monster when it came for him. As one Gorilla Man died, another was reborn-- Hale was transformed by a strange curse into a new Gorilla Man. Repulsed and ashamed, Hale elected to stay in the jungle rather than return and face the public or his family.Later that same decade, the Gorilla Man was sought out by the heroes Marvel Boy and Jann the Jungle Girl, on behalf of FBI agent Jimmy Woo. After Marvel Boy's promise to find a cure for Hale's curse through advanced science, Hale agreed to join Jimmy Woo and his allies in freeing President Eisenhower from the clutches of the Yellow Claw. These \"G-Men\" operated for another six months, until the government decreed that the country wasn't ready to learn of such a super-team and its exploits.In more recent years, Ken Hale was recruited by S.H.I.E.L.D. to join their Howling Commandos unit, a strikeforce squad of supernatural creatures. (He was recommended by Woo himself, now a member of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Directorate.) The squad took down the terrorist Lords of the Living Lightning and defended the Commandos’ Area 13 headquarters by an invasion of monsters led by Merlin. When Jimmy Woo was nearly killed in tracking down the Atlas Foundation, S.H.I.E.L.D. consulted Ken since Woo had kept his investigation hidden from them. Hale was just as mystified, but secretly contacted M-11, the Human Robot, one of his allies in the 50s. The two recovered Woo's body in a daring rescue, bringing him to Marvel Boy's flying saucer, where he was revived (at least to the state Marvel Boy last remembered him-- 1959.) Jimmy Woo and his allies began the search for the Atlas Foundation anew. The trail led to Mr. Lao, a literal dragon working on behalf of the Yellow Claw. The Claw revealed that Jimmy was a true descendant of Genghis Khan, and he revealed that he became Jimmy's greatest enemy in order to help him build a legend worthy of his lineage. In fact, Jimmy's adventures with his allies had been set up by the Claw and Mr. Lao from the very beginning, ever since the 1950s! For example, it was Mr. Lao (in human form) who first introduced the legend of the Gorilla Man to Ken Hale and set him on the course to Africa.Jimmy Woo took control of the Atlas Foundation. However, he professed his determination to use such resources for the betterment of the world. He, Gorilla Man, and the other Agents of Atlas would become a clandestine force for good.",

      "biography": "Franklin Hall was a scientist working at a private physics research center in the Canadian Rockies on a practical teleportation device. During an experiment, Hal overloaded the power causing an explosion that intermingled his molecules with the sub-nuclear graviton particles that were being generated in a nearby series of companion particle accelerators. Recovering from the accident, Hall discovered that he could mentally control gravity. A man of great ambition, he designed a costume, called himself Graviton, and took over the research center, lifting it several thousands of feet into the sky. Alerted to this threat, the Avengers tried to rescue the research center. In the fury of the battle, Graviton unleashed sufficient power to cause the matter of the sky-borne laboratory to collapse inward around him. The matter of the research center was infused with the atoms of his body for a time, giving his new 60-foot form a massive gravitational field. Eventually he as able to separate his organic atoms from the land mass he had merged with.\n\nGraviton attempted to find a female companion by taking a New York department store hostage and levitating it above the skyscrapers. This caught the attention of Thor and during the battle, Graviton was exiled in a dimensional void by Thor. For months he drifted in a state of suspended animation until a sudden influx of energy released a bizarre construct passing through the void at the time, which would soon become the creation of the mysterious Beyonder. Graviton's consciousness was restored and he was able to home in on the charging field used by the criminal Blank and returned to Earth.\n\nSetting up a base of operations in Los Angeles, Graviton attempted to unite all of the criminal mobs under his leadership, but was thwarted in the attempt by the newly-formed West Coast Avengers. Almost immediately afterward, Hall escaped from custody and formed a group of villains based on the four 'Fundamental Forces' with the villains Halflife, Quantum, and Zzzax. Although he temporarily defeated the West Coast Avengers once more, he was eventually thwarted when the Avenger Tigra turned the villains against each other, and Hall's floating island shot into the atmosphere.\n\nHall again returned to battle the Avengers in revenge, but during the battle the Vision merged his intangible android body with Hall's, then increased his density, causing Hall's density to collapse in on itself. Hall was thus shunted from reality, finding himself in another dimension. The natives of the dimension, which Hall named the P'Tah, hailed his arrival as one of a god's, and Hall used this to his advantage, although their limited intelligence soon left frustrated. Using his scientific abilities, he constructed a beacon so that someone might find and rescue him.\n\nAfter many months, Hall's signal was noticed by the robotic Techno, who at the time was working with the Baron Zemo. At Zemo's direction, Techno reconfigured a robotic version of the Hulk, and Zemo set the robot Hulk against his former lackeys, now the hero team Thunderbolts, who fought the Hulk-bot. The battle allowed the robot to siphon and store enough energy to breach the dimensional barriers and release Hall. Not caring about the particulars of his rescue, Hall lashed out at the Thunderbolts and the Great Lakes Avengers (then, the Lightning Rods) who were on the scene. He was about to kill them all when the Thunderbolt Moonstone convinced Hall that his power and ambition meant nothing if he had no goals. Losing face, Hall left the scene to think about this fact.\n\nHall soon returned, commanding a large mass of floating land and declaring himself ruler of a new nation, Sky Island. He recruited his subjects, dubbed Sky Raiders, and a harem in return for granting them the power to defy gravity, and they began to loot and pillage San Francisco, California. He was again opposed by the Thunderbolts with their erstwhile ally, Archangel, and he summarily defeated them all. They were freed by the Thunderbolt Jolt, who borrowed technology derived from Machine Man, whose flight capabilities were powered by \"canceling out the gravity equation.\" Now unaffected by Hall's power, the Thunderbolts escaped and continued to battle, ultimately canceling out Hall's access to his power. When Hall regained his power, the gravitational force rushed inward, collapsing inward on himself once again, and Hall was shunted to another dimension like before.\n\nThere, Hall was rescued by a mysterious stranger, a representative of the P'tah known as M'Reel, and both came to Earth. M'Reel encouraged Hall to begin discovering his true calling, and Hall recruited Moonstone of the Thunderbolts for help, still spurred by her accusations of thinking too small. Moonstone helped Hall to further refine his godlike power and fueled his ego, thinking that by so doing, she would be better able to manipulate him for her own ends. Instead, Hall embarked on an ambitious plan to capture every major world city, hold the world's heroes captive, and literally reshape the planet in his own image.\n\nAlso bent on revenge, Hall confronted the headquarters of the Thunderbolts, although the team at this time had disbanded and been replaced by the Redeemers. The Redeemers opposed Hall and were killed, except for the Fixer, who joined Moonstone alongside Hall, and Citizen V, who recruited the remaining Thunderbolts to confront Hall. Through a mixture of surprise tactics and negotiation, all of the Thunderbolts managed to fight Hall to a standstill, and Hall sustained fatal injuries as a result. At this time, Fixer discovered M'Reel was surreptitiously using Hall's ambient energies, funneling them in order to open a portal to the P'Tah's dimension. M'Reel succeeded in opening the portal, revealing this to be his motives in helping Hall. The Thunderbolts fought back the P'Tah invasion, but it took Hall's dying effort to cause the portal to implode, sending himself and the P'Tah back. At the same time, Hall attempted to save the Thunderbolts from a similar fate, using his powers to send them to the planet known as Counter-Earth. Hall was presumed dead, unable to survive his injuries and the dimensional fold.\n\nHowever, Graviton was later seen among those villains incarcerated in the Raft and was attempting an escape during the mass breakout engineered by Electro. He was confronted by heroes who would become the new Avengers, but he easily put them all on the ropes until the arrival of Iron Man. Iron Man got the drop on Graviton by flying in at an extreme speed and fired a new heat beam from his chestplate at the villain, nearly killing him if not for Captain America's order to stand down. During this battle, Graviton exhibited a new scar on his shaved head, and he behaved erratically and irrationally, often babbling. Perhaps there is more to his recent appearance that has yet to be revealed.",

He could tell that there were faint traces of writing on the other side, so he had tests performed on it by a forensics lab.The tests revealed text stating that Gwen had been pregnant and had twins. He collected DNA from the grave of Gwen Stacy and prooved that the twins, Sarah and Gabriel (who had been threatning and attacking him and his family) were her children.Mary Jane then revealed that she had known for years that the father of Gwen's children was Norman Osborn, the Green Goblin. He got so enraged that he broke everything within reach.\n\nHe met Sarah and Gabriel on the Brooklyn Bridge, the place of Gwen's death, to tell them that Osborn had been manipulating them. Angered, Gabriel remained convinced of Osborn's lies that Peter was their father, and that he had abandoned them. Sarah, on the other hand, believed Peter. Gabriel then attacked Spider-Man, but Peter refused to fight back since he didn't want to hurt Gabe. Police then shot at them, wounding Sarah and causing her to fall off the bridge. While Spider-Man rescued her, Gabe went underground to an area predetermined by Norman Osborn. There, he discovered that Peter had been telling the truth. He injected himself with the Goblin Formula and donned a gray version of the Green Goblin costume, becoming the Gray Goblin. Sarah shot at him (to protect a weakened Spider-Man), causing the Glider to blow up. He landed on a beach, with amnesia. He later returned home to Paris where Sarah secretly cared for him. While his sister left to be trained as an Interpol agent, Gabriel was last seen in a crazed state fleeing the Osborn estate.",

      "biography": "Very little is known about the early life of Graydon Creed, except that during the Cold War he was born to two mutant terrorists, Mystique and Sabretooth. Growing up Creed was abandoned by his mother when she discovered he was not a mutant, and she sent him to live in an orphanage. Not knowing who they truly were, Creed came to hate his parents for leaving him. He went on to become a rabid anti-mutant lobbyist and founded the Friends of Humanity, a grass-roots campaign dedicated to eradicating the perceived mutant menace that quickly turned into a national movement.Creed also came to join the Upstarts , a group of wealthy and powerful individuals who had banded together by the enigmatic Gamesmaster with the sole purpose of killing mutants for points in a twisted game. After learning of his parentage, Creed sought to kill them as part of the Upstarts' game. Disguised as the armored Tribune, Creed hired assassins to kill his mother and had his father implanted with a bomb. Sabretooth managed to remove the device and confronted his son, who callously shot Sabretooth's assistant Birdy, a mutant telepath whom Sabretooth employed to keep his homicidal rages in check.During the Upstarts' self-professed “Younghunt”, Creed was blackmailed into revealing the location of the Upstarts' prisoners by the New Warriors who threatened to expose Creed as a mutant collaborator and the son of mutants.Later, using the resources he had gained through the Friends of Humanity, and with the support of the government-sponsored anti-mutant taskforce Operation: Zero Tolerance, Creed nominated himself as a presidential candidate and ran on an anti-mutant platform. Capitalizing on a near-hysterical fear of mutants in the general public. Creed's popularity swelled, which led to the Daily Bugle newspaper launching an investigation into Creed's activities. When a reporter from the Bugle obtained information regarding Creed's parentage, Zero Tolerance's leader Bastion killed the journalist to prevent the news from leaking out. Although they stopped the reporter Creed did not manage to catch that his assistant was really an undercover Samuel Guthrie (Cannonball).On the eve of the election, Creed was assassinated during his campaign speech when a plasma beam completely disintegrated him. It was later revealed that the beam was fired by a time-delayed weapon configured by Mystique's future self whose mind had been sent back into her past body to ensure her son's death. Recently, Creed was revived by Bastion (using a transmode virus).",

      "biography": "There is no shortage of great villains within the world of Spider-Man (poor Peter), but there are none more feared or deranged than Norman Osborn’s Green Goblin. Perhaps the very antithesis of New York’s resident Wall Crawler, the Goblin does not use his power for responsibility or the betterment of society, but instead to reign down chaos and destruction. Mr. Osborn was the result of his turbulent upbringing, which manifested itself in the villainous persona he would one day grow up to inhabit completely.\n\nSelf-Made Man\n\nNorman is raised by an abusive and alcoholic father who lost the family fortune. Maybe this was the impetus for Norman to become a self-made man, as he grows up to be a ruthless industrialist. He is the co-owner of the leading New York firm, Osborn Industries (AKA Oscorp), which specializes in chemical manufacturing via Osborn Chemicals, as well as other areas of research and development, including robotics. Norman’s wife Emily dies within a year of their son Harry’s birth, leaving Norman embittered. Unfortunately, this causes him to repeat the sins of his own father and Norman raises Harry dispassionately, often devoid of fatherly warmth, frustrated by Harry’s failure to demonstrate academic excellence or a competitive drive. Despite living in opulence, Harry feels depressed and neglected by his father.\n\nEarly in his career, before he ever becomes the Green Goblin, Norman resorts to criminal means to advance his agenda. When Norman faces opposition from the owners of Malone’s flophouse, who refuse to sell so that Osborn could build a warehouse, Osborn sends the Enforcers— “Fancy” Dan Brito, Montana, and the Ox (AKA Raymond Bloch)—to violently persuade them. Namor the Sub-Mariner, now a homeless amnesiac, retaliates by destroying Osborn’s construction equipment. Private detective Mac Gargan (later Scorpion and Venom) steals military robotics plans from Osborn for competitor Obadiah Stane, causing Osborn Industries to lose a lucrative contract.",

      "biography": "Norman Osborn was a scientific genius who founded his own company, Oscorp, over thirty years ago. It developed new technologies and innovative materials for the manufacturing, construction, automotive and chemical-processing industries, among others. Osborn also liked to keep his company at the forefront of new sciences, such as bioengineering; when Colonel Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. made it quietly known they wanted to tender contracts to the private sector to develop new “Super Soldier Serums”, Oscorp took on competitors such as Hammer Industries to win the corporate bidding war; however, it rapidly became clear that Norman had misled S.H.I.E.L.D. as to how ready his company was to produce results. They had rushed the research process to win the bid, their formula was messy, and their presentation had been largely “smoke and mirrors”. After two and a half years without results, Fury severed ties between S.H.I.E.L.D. and Oscorp. Losing the contract left Oscorp shaky; to bolster their reputation and share price, Norman publicly declared that he had discovered a miracle compound, Oz, with undisclosed, “closely guarded” properties. With the breathing space this provided, Norman tried to rush the development of the compound he had told everyone he already had.Working with scientists such as Otto Octavius, Norman began testing Oz on animals. Disaster seemed to strike when a spider exposed to the compound escaped and bit visiting student Peter Parker, a friend of Norman’s son Harry. Fearing exposure of his illegal research should Peter die from the effects of the bite, Osborn had his hired gun Shaw observe the boy, and was prepared to have him murdered; but instead of becoming ill, Peter developed arachnid-like super-powers. Believing he had stumbled upon exactly what he needed to save his company, Norman decided to test direct application of the Oz Compound on a human guinea pig – himself. Doctor Octavius supervised this process, but something went horribly wrong; an explosion destroyed the lab, killing most of those present. Octavius and bystander Harry both survived, though both were changed as a result; but the most obvious and immediate effect was on Norman, who was transformed into a gargoyle-like strongman. The monstrous, mentally muddled Norman wandered the streets in a haze before destroying his own mansion home in a fireball that killed his wife; Harry barely escaped. Norman next attacked Harry’s school, hunting for Peter, who had adopted the costumed persona of Spider-Man. As Spider-Man, Parker tried to subdue the monster, their fight carrying them towards the city and climaxing atop a bridge, where police marksmen riddled Norman with gunfire. Badly injured, Norman lunged at Spider-Man, missed, and plunged into the waters below, apparently drowning. Informing the police that the goblin was his mutated father, a distraught Harry was taken away for questioning and his own protection. Norman survived, regaining human form. Using injections of Oz to transform again, Norman gradually gained full use of his speech and mental faculties in his monstrous form. Continued exposure to the drug also drove him insane, and he began to see tiny creatures that would provide him with conflicting advice on what to do. He remained in hiding at first, using his contacts to recover Harry from protective custody and have the investigations into the lab explosion and his mansion fire dropped. He hired a psychiatrist, Doctor Warren, who hypnotized Harry into believing his father had not been the creature he had seen. When Norman’s old rival, Justin Hammer, was slain by an equally insane Otto Octavius (now calling himself Doctor Octopus), Norman decided to come out of hiding. He concocted a cover story claiming Hammer had been behind the attacks, acts of sabotage which had forced Norman to go into seclusion to protect his son, and which had now ended with Hammer’s demise. Not believing this for a second, Nick Fury had S.H.I.E.L.D. illegally spy on Norman. Harry returned to school, inviting Peter Parker to visit him and his father; not knowing what else to do, the terrified youth reluctantly accepted. As soon as Peter and Norman were alone, Norman assumed his goblin form and told Parker that he would work for Norman or see his loved ones suffer. At school the next day, Fury confided in Peter, explaining that S.H.I.E.L.D. knew of Norman’s threats but could do nothing until Osborn made a public move. That night, Norman tried to tighten his hold on Peter by inviting Peter’s Aunt May to his skyscraper; angrily, Peter went alone to confront him. Norman met him on the roof in his goblin form, and when Peter refused to meet his demands, Norman snatched the arriving Mary Jane Watson, Peter’s girlfriend, who had likewise been lured to the building. Osborn carried the terrified girl to the Queensboro Bridge, then threw her off it. As Spider-Man leapt to her rescue, S.H.I.E.L.D. attack helicopters moved in. Attacked by both Peter and the gunships, Norman fled back to his skyscraper, intending to inject himself with even more Oz. When Harry interrupted, Norman used a post-hypnotic suggestion to render him unconscious, then took more of the serum, mutating further. Spider-Man arrived seconds later, but was swiftly overpowered. Harry awoke to see his father strangling the unmasked hero, backlit by the lights of the approaching attack copters. Peter managed to kick free and bury Norman under a heavy stone desk, which Norman shrugged off, throwing it out the window. Spider-Man grabbed it with his webbing to stop it smashing down into the busy street below, but left himself exposed; as Norman tried to rip his head off, Harry rammed a large piece of jagged metal through his father’s back. Norman rounded on his son, and seeing an opening, the S.H.I.E.L.D. choppers opened fire. Injured beyond the limits of his endurance, Norman collapsed and reverted to a comatose human form.Norman was taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody and stored alongside other genetically mutated criminals in a secure research facility, where he was studied and interrogated by Dr. Hank Pym (Giant-Man). Fury said they would remain imprisoned until they either co-operated or died. When Pym asked Norman in a group session why he had destroyed his life by deliberately mutating himself, Norman accused him of simply wanting to steal the secret of the Oz formula. Enraged to learn that S.H.I.E.L.D. already had the formula, as they had confiscated everything he owned, Norman began to transform, proving he no longer needed injections of Oz, before security measures brought him down. A few months later, fellow inmate Doctor Octopus engineered a breakout, and the criminals slaughtered their way out the facility, hiding out together. Norman became de facto leader of their group, which included Doctor Octopus, Electro, Kraven and Sandman. Osborn called the White House, demanding amnesty, one hundred million dollars, his company and his son back, and Fury fired; otherwise, he would make public the story of their illegal imprisonment and bring the President down. Fixated on the idea that Peter Parker was his son, Norman had Octopus hack into S.H.I.E.L.D. systems and shut down security at its main base, the Triskelion, allowing the escaped villains to kidnap Spider-Man, who had been taken there into protective custody. With a blackmailed Spider-Man increasing their numbers to six, the group assaulted the White House, but was intercepted on the front lawn by S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Ultimates. Norman battled both Captain America and Spider-Man (who had learned his loved ones were safe in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody), but was then confronted by Harry, who had been brought in by Fury. As his son pleaded with him to stop, Norman began to revert to human form until Iron Man shot him from behind, deliberately overloading his genetic sequence; Norman’s transformation went out of control and he collapsed, stuck midway between forms. Fury had the unconscious villain cryogenically frozen and removed for further tests; however, it seems inevitable that he will break free someday and return to plague Fury and Spider-Man again.",

      "biography": "Paul Pierre Duval, a young chemist working for a pharmaceutical company in Paris, accidentally spilled a potion contaminated by some unknown organic substance on his right hand. To his dismay, his hand began to turn to stone-like material still capable of movement. Accidentally touching his other hand, he found that he could transform his entire body into the stone-like material. He also discovered that any matter he touched also turned to stone. Mercenary by nature, Duval decided to exploit his bizarre power for personal profit and turned to theft, quickly becoming one of France’s most accomplished criminals as the Grey Gargoyle.The Grey Gargoyle, bored with lack of challenge to his crimes, decided to travel to America and wrest the secret of immortality from Thor. He was twice bested in combat by him before returning to what had proved more successful in the past-- pure mercenary endeavors. His first attempt was to steal a new cobalt-powered weapon from Stark Industries, and he was actually successful after transforming Iron Man’s battle armor to stone. Iron Man returned when the Gargoyle’s power wore off, stopping the villain by destroying the machinery he hoped to abscond with. Later, an attempted to acquire the deadly compound dubbed \"Element X\" went horribly wrong. He was confronted by Captain America, the Falcon, and Nick Fury, cornered, and accidentally shot into space.The Gargoyle found himself trapped aboard a satellite in Earth’s orbit, where the subversive scientific organization Advanced Idea Mechanics rescued him. On their behalf, he joined their efforts to launch a satellite with heavy weaponry, fighting Captain America and Spider-Man, but was accidentally rocketed into space once more. In deep space, he was retrieved by the Bird of Prey, a pirate starship whose crew members were of various alien races. Ever out for himself, the Grey Gargoyle forced himself into command of the ship.The Bird of Prey encountered the starship StarJammer, used by Thor, Sif, and the Warriors Three in their adventure to the Doomsday Star. The Gargoyle had the heroes captured and conscripted to join the crew for slave labor. The heroes’ ally, the Recorder, not only helped his friends escape but started a mutiny among the crew against the Grey Gargoyle. When the rebellion grew out of control, the Grey Gargoyle professed to want to join Thor in order to return to Earth. However, at the height of the battle, the Gargoyle tried to flee and seemed to have died in a violent explosion. In fact, Duval survived by created a stone-like cocoon around himself. Using the cocoon to travel through space, he managed to return to Earth, where he immediately battled the Avengers. In the process, his cocoon was destroyed, and he was taken into police custody. Duval was soon freed by villains of the fourth Masters of Evil organization, whose goal was to destroy the Avengers, but following a defeat at the hands of the Wasp and Black Knight, he was again returned to jail. Having broken out, Duval embarked on a unique plan. He created an artistic persona, Paul St. Pierre, and became a successful and highly sought-after sculptor. In fact, his statues were real people, transformed by his power and sealed with a special polymer compound that would make this change permanent. His plot was uncovered when Tony Stark attended his gallery, and he exposed the Gargoyle.   The Grey Gargoyle was broken out of prison again, this time to join several master criminals in a coordinated attack on various heroes and sent to battle the Hulk. At the time, the Hulk possessed a gray alter-ego, and this confused Duval, who had thought that the Hulk had turned to stone but nonetheless kept moving. The Hulk summarily defeated the Gargoyle, breaking his arm, and left. The Grey Gargoyle continued to be a recurring villain in the lives of many heroes, battling the likes of Captain America and Spider-Man as part of Doctor Doom’s “Doom’s Brigade,” fighting She-Hulk, and being accosted by the Black Widow. In the latter case, the Widow claimed a self-appointed mission to track down and destroy all of the Avengers’ former enemies, and she seemed to obliterate the Grey Gargoyle, blasting his stone form into pieces.Later, Duval, somehow recovering from his previous encounter, was contacted by the Gideon Trust, a business executive board interested in using technology developed by the Fantastic Four for their own purposes. They bade the Grey Gargoyle to attack the Thing, in a sort of initiation to their employ. The Gargoyle seemed successful in turning the Thing into non-living stone, but he was defeated by the remaining members of the Fantastic Four. In addition, the Thing was able to break free of the Gargoyle’s power as it kick-started his ability to transform into his human alter-ego and back again at will.Paul Duval returned to his initial goal of searching for Thor’s secret to immortality when the death of a childhood friend affected him significantly. He attacked Thor Girl, Thor’s associate Tarene, and actually managed to defeat her, leaving her for dead and stealing her magical hammer. Proclaiming himself to now be like a god, the Gargoyle was immediately confronted by Desak the God-Slayer who was searching for Thor. Desak defeated the Gargoyle with ease. He was next seen serving time at Pym Experimental Penitentiary Number One, a prison that kept its super-powered inmates miniaturized, and participated in a breakout led by the Mad Thinker only to be thwarted by She-Hulk.Recently, Grey Gargoyle was defeated by a new vigilante group calling themselves the New Warriors.  He was then taken into custody by the NYPD.",

Both brothers struggled in vain for the approval of their demanding, abusive father, Sanford; but where Simon was shy and studious, Eric was athletic, wild and reckless. Regarded as the black sheep of the family, Eric became a thief and tried unsuccessfully to pressure Simon into participating in his petty crimes. Secretly admiring Simon's virtue, Eric developed an unrealistically idealized view of his brother, whom he loved and resented in equal measure. Scorning his family's high-tech manufacturing business, Eric became a gambler and a professional criminal, rising within the ranks of the Maggia organized crime cartel. Simon, meanwhile, dutifully entered the family business and took over its management after Sanford's death. Williams Innovations gradually failed, thanks in part to stiff competition from rival firm Stark Industries, and a desperate Simon turned to Eric for help-though Eric's attempted intimidation and coercion of business rivals and potential clients failed to produce useful results. As a last resort, Simon stole money from his own company, hoping to invest it in Eric's Maggia ventures for a fast profit and save the business; but Simon got caught, and was arrested for embezzlement. Unable to accept his brother's fall from grace, Eric lied to his mother and others by claiming that he was the real embezzler, insisting that Simon had merely taken the blame. Simon was transformed into Wonder Man by Baron Heinrich Zemo and used against the Avengers before sacrificing himself to save the heroes, who preserved a copy of his brain patterns in the hope of resurrecting him someday. Learning of Simon's apparent demise, Eric went mad with grief and wrongly blamed the Avengers for Simon's death. He hired the Tinkerer to build him a high-tech miniature arsenal in the form of a scythe, enhancing it with a coma-inducing device created by the mad robot Ultron, a fellow Avengers enemy who became so intrigued by Eric's family-inspired vendetta that he secured a copy of Simon's brain patterns for experimental purposes, later using them to create the android Vision. As the Grim Reaper, Eric very nearly killed the Avengers but was thwarted by the Black Panther. Escaping, the Reaper recruited fellow Avengers foes Living Laser, Man-Ape (M'Baku), Power Man (Erik Josten) and Swordsman (Jacques Duquesne) into the Lethal Legion, whose members competed with each other to see who could capture or kill the most Avengers; but the Legion was soon defeated and imprisoned, thanks largely to a new Avengers recruit, the Vision, whom the Reaper could not bring himself to kill. Stealing and preserving Simon's body, the Reaper offered to transfer Vision's mind into it and make him human in exchange for not opposing Reaper's efforts to destroy the Avengers, though Vision refused. Later, in partnership with a Space Phantom and unwittingly manipulated by Immortus, the Reaper seized control of a faction of the subversive group Hydra and conspired against the Avengers, again tempting Vision with offers of a human body, at one point promising to seize the body of Captain America for this purpose. Vision played along to infiltrate the Reaper's plans but ultimately helped the Avengers defeat the villains, though the Reaper and Vision saved each other's lives in turn during the fight. Captured and imprisoned, Eric eventually escaped and recovered Simon's body, which had actually been in a death-like stasis for years while he mutated into a new form. Once Simon was revived (apparently with the aid of Ultron), the Reaper hired the voodoo master Black Talon (Sam Barone) to send the half-dead hero after the Avengers in a zombie-like state, though Simon soon regained full consciousness and took up residence with the Avengers. Aided in penetrating Avengers security by Ultron, the Reaper imprisoned Vision, Wonder Man and several Avengers, staging a mock trial to determine whether the mutated Wonder Man or the android Vision was truly the real Simon Williams. The Reaper decided in favor of Simon and would have killed Vision, but he was defeated by Wonder Man. Deciding that Wonder Man and Vision were both inhuman mockeries of the true Simon, the Reaper tried unsuccessfully to kill them before enlisting his new lover Nekra and old allies Ultron, Black Talon, Goliath (Josten) and Man-Ape in a bizarre scheme to destroy the Avengers and re-create the \"real\" Simon Williams by transferring portions of the minds of Vision and Wonder Man into the voodoo-animated corpse of criminal Brady Kent, which had been surgically altered to duplicate Simon's original human form. The plan failed and the Reaper-having belatedly realized that Vision and Wonder Man were truly his brothers-fell to his death while fleeing in shame. Nekra revived Eric as an unwitting, unusually lifelike zombie, teaming with him and the Brady Kent zombie to assault the hospital where Vision's wife Scarlet Witch was giving birth; but the Reaper fell dead when he broke Nekra's spell by discovering, to his horror, that he was a zombie. A Grim Reaper soon fought the Avengers as part of Immortus's Legion of the Unliving, but whether that was the true Eric Williams or not is unclear. Later, Nekra raised the Reaper again, this time as a zombie who could sustain his existence by draining others' life force with his scythe, an ability he tested by fatally stabbing Nekra. He renewed his partnership with Ultron, but did so in order to subvert Ultron's plans to \"robotize\" humanity since this scheme would have deprived the Reaper of human victims; in the end, both villains were captured by the Avengers. Shortly thereafter, the Red Skull used both Reaper and Ultron as part of his mind-controlled army of super-villains in a world conquest scheme involving a giant laser cannon, but the Avengers thwarted this plot. Gaining power from the demonic Old Ones' Lloigoroth, the Reaper caused an airliner crash and captured a commuter train, transforming some of his victims into superhuman zombie facsimiles of deceased Avengers foes, apparently imbuing them with the originals' spirits. Reaper's Legion of the Unliving nearly destroyed the Avengers, but his hold over the zombies broke when Vision forced Eric to admit that he had killed himself and the Avengers were not to blame. The Reaper was seemingly consumed by Lloigoroth for his failure. Later, the Reaper appeared to haunt Simon again as part of a baffling conflict staged by the demons Mephisto and Blackheart, though how much (if any) of this encounter was real remains unclear. When Wonder Man died again and mystically returned in a ghostly state, the barriers between life and death weakened enough for Grim Reaper's spirit to return to the earthly plane, mystically enslaving the spirits of Wonder Man and several other dead Avengers to attack the living Avengers. However, the undead Avengers were freed from the Reaper's control by the Scarlet Witch and turned on the Reaper, helping the living Avengers defeat him. In the end, most of the undead Avengers returned to their respective afterlives, but Wonder Man was fully resurrected through the Witch's magic, which also restored the Grim Reaper to life after he was forced to admit his love for his brother. Since his rebirth, the Reaper has apparently decided to abandon his old obsessions. He has even fought alongside the Avengers twice, aiding them against their common enemies Ultron and Alkhema; however, the Reaper remains a ruthless criminal and has renewed his association with the Maggia, renewing his enmity with the Avengers in the process.",

      "biography": "When working for the American-Canadian Petro-Chemical Company in Canada, James MacDonald Hudson designed an armored suit for the purposes of geological exploration. When he found out his superior, Jerry Jaxon, wanted to sell the design to the military, Hudson stole the suit and used it to sabotage Am-Can’s capability for producing it. He left the company, taking with him the helmet that was his own property. Heather McNeil, Jaxon’s secretary, discovered the truth of the sabotage and, attracted to Hudson, quit the company to be with him. After a protracted legal battle, Hudson won the rights to claim his invention as his own. He was invited by the Canadian Prime Minister to participate in the creation of Department H, a top secret research and development agency within the Canadian Ministry of Defense. Within a year, Hudson married Heather McNeil.During this time, James and Heather Hudson were attacked by a \"wild man\" while visiting Canada's Wood Buffalo National Park. They helped nurse the man to health, helping the man called Logan recover from his state of shock. (It was later revealed that he had just escaped the tortuous experiments of the Weapon X program, which was responsible for his partial amnesia and animalistic rages at the time.)  The first public appearance of the Fantastic Four inspired Hudson to create his own for of superhuman champions on behalf of the Canadian government. James Hudson, with Logan’s help, began the creation of Alpha Flight, and it was planned that Logan, as Wolverine, would lead the team. However, Logan quit Department H when he received an offer from Professor X to join the X-Men. James Hudson, then, reluctantly became the team’s leader after improving upon the first suit he had created.At first, James Hudson's codename was \"Weapon Alpha.\" Under this name he and Alpha Flight attempted to carry out his orders to bring Wolverine back to Department H by force. Hudson failed in this task, and in the course of this mission nearly killed the X-Men's ally, Dr. Moira MacTaggert, by accident. The guilt-ridden Hudson subsequently took the new code name Vindicator, believing he now had to vindicate himself. Over time, the Hudsons resumed their friendly relationship with Wolverine, and even the Canadian government accepted Wolverine's defection.With Hudson’s administration, Department H created Alpha Flight, Beta Flight, and Gamma Flight before financial considerations led the Canadian government to shut down the department. This didn’t stop Vindicator from patrolling the nation or keeping contacts with former Alphans. When investigating a mystical disturbance, Vindicator stumbled upon the emergence of Tundra, and Heather Hudson summoned Alpha Flight to assist him. With their success against Tundra, the heroes decided to remain together as a team despite the lack of government funding. Hudson took the codename Guardian in part because of the new change and also after having come to terms with his guilt over injuring MacTaggert.Alpha Flight faced its greatest contest within the next several months. Jerry Jaxon, whose career and life was ruined after Hudson’s departure from Am-Can, had created Omega Flight in the hopes of taking revenge on Hudson. He kidnapped Heather, led Omega Flight in defeating Alpha Flight, and used the Box armor to take on Guardian one-on-one. Hudson defeated Box in a pitched battle, and the feedback from the Box armor killed Jaxon. Unfortunately, Hudson’s own battlesuit was severely damaged as well. He tried to remove it before it would explode and failed. Heather entered the room just in time to witness the explosion that killed her husband. In reality, Hudson was not killed, but thrown backwards through time and space and captured by the alien race known as the Q`wrrlln. In their attempt to help him, they revived Hudson's body into a cybernetic composite, thinking that the leftovers of his battlesuit were a part of his physiology. The aliens returned him to Earth in suspended animation, where he lay buried for countless centuries, until he was discovered by the Roxxon Oil Corporation many years after his supposed death with Omega Flight. Roxxon attempted to use him for their own purposes, but he reasserted control of himself and rejoined Alpha Flight, now code-named Vindicator. Soon, however, the Q`wrrlln contacted Hudson in order to use him as a weapon against the planet-ravager alien Galactus. Hudson teleported members of Alpha Flight and the hero team Avengers to the Q`wrrlln homeworld. Successful in thwarting Galactus, Hudson apparently sacrificed himself again in order to return the teams back to Earth.As before, Hudson was not killed, but shunted into null space where he was later discovered by Alpha Flight's archenemy, the Master of the World. The Master bent James to his will and sent him against Alpha Flight as the Antiguard. It was Heather`s love for James that allowed him to reassert control and help defeat the Master. Hudson, reunited with his wife, left Alpha Flight to be free agents, occasionally doing assignments for the Canadian government. However, the two people had grown too far apart due to their separate life experiences, and they parted ways.Hudson returned to work for the Canadian government, when Department H was reopened, Hudson wanted to be on board. Unfortunately, Department H was involved in many dubiously criminal experiments, and Hudson refused to work for them. In retaliation, the Department had Hudson captured, his memories and mind downloaded into computers, and his body sent into space. Hudson's battlesuit, however, reacted with some part of Hudson to interfere with the trajectory, and Hudson landed in Antarctica, where Sasquatch was working at a secluded laboratory. Shortly afterward, Department H created a nineteen year old clone of Hudson with his memories and battlesuit. This new Guardian became the leader of a new version of Alpha Flight.Sasquatch managed to revive Hudson, since the electromagnetic pulse created by his suit allowed him to stay alive despite his body’s physical condition and the harsh Antarctic environment. Together, they reformed their own version of Alpha Flight to confront Department H. Hudson's Flight confronted the current Alpha Flight and cloned Guardian. The two versions of Alpha Flight soon reconciled and joined together as one.There was initially some confusion on which Guardian was the true Hudson, although the younger clone was soon revealed as the duplicate. Both the original and duplicate Hudson were soon kidnapped by the subversive organization A.I.M. who wanted to study them both. Through the intervention of both Alpha Flight and Wolverine, both Hudsons were freed, but the duplicate was seemingly killed during the escape. Hudson returned to Alpha Flight, where he led them under the guise of Guardian, and even returned to working for Departmnet H alongside Walter Langkowski, Sasquatch. Shortly thereafter, Heather learned she was pregnant.  A deranged co-worker, Dr. Jiroult, however, developed an obsessive infatuation for Heather. Picking up on an off-hand remark, he believed she wanted to be with him. He used a powerful energy projector called a Zero Gun to confront James Hudson, shooting him and leaving him for dead. James’ dying thoughts attracted the attention of Shaman, who rallied several Alphans to race to Hudson’s side. Shaman entreated the spirits of the air to revive Hudson, who was once again restored to life, albeit barely, and they saved Heather from the clutches of Jiroult. During the battle, Heather went into labor and gave birth to a baby girl. Both Hudsons continued to serve in Alpha Flight, until being captured by the alien Plodex. Sasquatch was the only member to escape, and he formed an all-new, all-different Alpha Flight to rescue the original team. Upon their rescue, they discovered that the Plodex complex was seeded with eggs that were using the genetic templates of the original Alphans for gestation. The Plodex homeworld was ready to receive these eggs to repopulate its planet, and the original Alpha Flight, James and Heather included, chose to accompany the eggs on the trip back to its home planet. They left Earth, and presumably their child, behind.Later, after a series of time-traveling misadventures, Alpha Flight was given Shaman’s magic pouch by their former enemy and time-manipulator, Flashback. Interestingly, this pouch was the same that Shaman had taken with him when he and the Alphans left Earth on the Plodex ship. After opening the contents of the pouch, the original members of Alpha Flight were magically transported to the present from some time in the past. This included a past version of James Hudson, Guardian, and the original team reclaimed the name Alpha Flight, setting themselves up as heroes in the present.",

      "image": "https://terrigen-cdn-dev.marvel.com/content/prod/1x/hammerhead.jpg",
      "biography": "Years ago, a minor gunman for an unidentified Maggia crime family was severely beaten and, his skull literally in fragments, left to die beneath a movie poster for \"The Al Capone Mob.\" Disfigured and delirious, he was discovered by disgraced surgeon Jonas Harrow, who, motivated by both humanitarian and experimental interests, replaced the gunman's skull and broken bones with a strong steel alloy, leaving his head broad and flattened. Upon his recovery, the gunman remembered nothing save his criminal ambitions, his mind still fixated upon the mobster poster. Rebuilding his own personality, he became a 1920s-style gangster called Hammerhead. His treatment was the earliest known instance of the criminal empowerment for which Harrow later became infamous. Determined to ascend to the underworld's peak, Hammerhead was willing to work his way to the top, and he moved from one crime family to another as his fortunes waxed and waned. His ambition and viciousness soon earned him a deadly reputation, as informants and reporters alike died for getting too close to his employers' interests. For a time he worked alongside the superhuman freelancer called Wade Wilson, later Deadpool, but little else is known of his early career.In recent years, Hammerhead ventured into loan shark territory, and among his clientele was wrestler Crusher Hogan; in a prophetic moment, Hammerhead was in the audience when Hogan was challenged by a masked youth soon to be known as Spider-Man. For years Hammerhead bided his time, and when the Maggia leader called the Top Man lost status after a clash with the Fantastic Four, he took control of the fallen gangster's mob and spent months reshaping it. When the Kingpin of Crime, the Maggia's greatest competitor, temporarily withdrew from New York, Hammerhead stepped into the power vacuum, as did Doctor Octopus. The pair's gangs warred in the streets until Spider-Man intervened, defeating them both. Octopus and the members of both gangs were arrested, but Hammerhead fled the country.During his exile, Hammerhead built his fighting skills to their peak. Returning to the U.S., he and his remaining gang attacked Octopus, who fled to an advanced atomic processing plant he hoped to acquire. Despite Spider-Man's interference, Hammerhead cornered Octopus near an atomic reactor, but when he charged Octopus, he struck the reactor instead. Spider-Man and Octopus fled, barely reaching safety before the reactor exploded and devastated the island, including Hammerhead's gang, the last survivors of the Top Man's organization.Through an unexplained space-time fluke, Hammerhead was not slain but rendered incorporeal, and he followed Octopus back to New York, briefly driving him to mental ruin. When not harassing Octopus, he materialized throughout New York and recruited new underlings, who were deeply impressed that not even an atomic explosion could end his efforts. Recovering, Octopus attempted to use a particle accelerator to eradicate Hammerhead, but this only played into Hammerhead's hands, for the accelerator instead restored him to solidity. Hunted by Octopus and Spider-Man, he fled in a helicopter, which Octopus downed over the bay, but he emerged unscathed, although he allowed his enemies to believe him dead.Hammerhead strengthened his new Maggia family with underlings trained by the super-skilled Taskmaster and hired the inventive Tinkerer to create a strength-magnifying exoskeleton. With the Kingpin back in power, Hammerhead sought to unite New York's Maggia families under his rule, but his summit was disrupted by the Human Torch who was following a false lead in a murder investigation. Despite his exoskeleton, Hammerhead proved no match for the Torch. When the Kingpin's interests again took him from New York, a new gang war broke out, much to the chagrin of Spider-Man and other crimefighters, but as Hammerhead planned his role, the Kingpin's right-hand man, the Arranger, had him bombed at a restaurant. Hammerhead hungered for vengeance but withdrew when the Kingpin returned to stabilize the city.Months later, when the lycanthropic Lobo Brothers challenged the Kingpin, the shape-shifting Chameleon, pursuing the underworld crown himself, allied with Hammerhead, who followed the former spy's lead in the fray. Predictably, Spider-Man opposed all comers, but when the smoke cleared, Hammerhead was one of New York's top three crimelords. Unfortunately, he hired the infamous hitman Tombstone as his right hand, which proved his undoing; in what he fancied was a gesture of good will, Hammerhead hired the Hobgoblin (Jason Macendale) to assassinate Tombstone's nemesis Robbie Robertson. But Tombstone had vowed that only he would slay Robertson, and when chance granted Tombstone superhuman power, he savagely beat Hammerhead, then lured Robertson into a trap. Spider-Man and other heroes intervened, enabling Hammerhead to escape, and he resumed sole rule of his organization when the Chameleon turned to other interests.When the Kingpin was temporarily toppled, both Hammerhead and Tombstone were among those who sought his Las Vegas interests, but the vigilantes Daredevil, Nomad, and the Punisher put an end to this venture. Soon afterward, Tombstone, aspiring to Maggia heights, once more beat up Hammerhead and had him ejected from New York. Mortified, Hammerhead went abroad and undermined the interests of the assassination mogul called the Foreigner, who recruited his ex-wife, famed mercenary Silver Sable, to aid him. Hammerhead got the better of Sable and, abandoning his imagined 1920s ethics, boasted that he would rape and kill her before his Maggia peers, but his twisted fantasies were punctured when Sable defeated him. Returning to the U.S., he regained his place among the Maggia leaders, which included, to his chagrin, Tombstone. However, when the long-absent crimelord Fortunato returned in alliance with the terrorists of Hydra, Hammerhead, incensed that such \"Nazis\" dared undermine New York, joined several other crimelords in a united front. They were nonetheless defeated, though the intervention of Daredevil and Scarlet Spider (briefly acting as Spider-Man) disrupted Fortunato's coup. While Hydra regrouped, Hammerhead remained one of the few holdouts and formed an uneasy alliance with Spider-Man and new hero SHOC against Hydra front man Crown. Dealing Crown a crippling blow, Hammerhead was content to lay low, apparently occupying himself with, among other things, marriage to an unidentified woman. However, the Kingpin, returning to his throne, had several crimelords, including Hammerhead, attacked and left for dead.But the Kingpin had unknowingly done Hammerhead a favor, for the attack seemingly stirred long-buried memories of a sister, Antonia, whom he learned was dying of cancer. Frantic to make up for years of amnesia, Hammerhead sought an ancient Atlantean tablet whose secrets would heal Antonia. Forcing scientist Curt Connors into his service, Hammerhead acquired the tablet and, despite Spider-Man's intervention, Connors created a serum that would bestow the desired power. However, when Connors attempted to drink the serum, Hammerhead's hireling Boomerang shattered the vial, prompting the scientist's transformation into his reptilian alter ego, the Lizard. Eventually, all concerned converged at the hospital where Antonia lay, and when the Lizard recreated the serum, Hammerhead consumed it and achieved godlike power. In a moment of compassion, he restored Connors to his senses, but the transcendent experience so enraptured him that the power faded before he could cure Antonia. However, Spider-Man prepared a third dosage to treat her, and a grateful Hammerhead allowed himself to be arrested.Briefly incarcerated in the power-dampening prison called the Cage, Hammerhead was soon again at liberty and, perhaps retaining a bit of godlike wisdom, launched his most ambitious scheme to date, a union of international crime families under his rule. As Hammerhead expected, the gang warfare drew Spider-Man's attention, and the crimelord obligingly manipulated the troublemakers in his organization into taking the brunt of the web-slinger's blows. He walked away from the proceedings closer to ruling status than ever, even presuming to seek financial ties with the Fantastic Four, the very team that toppled his predecessor years earlier. Although Hammerhead's rivals have often ridiculed his 1920s mannerisms, he has outlasted many such newcomers; while the Kingpin's power fluctuates and Tombstone again languishes as a henchman, he seems to be enjoying his greatest success yet.",

      "biography": "Decades ago, Hannibal King was a private detective who was hired to investigate an industrial espionage case. While King was casing a factory, the vampire Deacon Frost invaded and killed everyone there, including King, who awoke three days later in a morgue as a vampire. Horrified at what he had become, King resisted his vampiric instincts and continued to work as a private detective, taking the blood he needed from animals, corpses and blood banks. Determined to find Deacon Frost, King took a special interest in cases involving the supernatural and soon met the vampire hunter Blade, who was also tracking Frost. Although Blade instinctively hated King for being a vampire, they put aside their differences to destroy Frost, and Blade was finally able to accept King for who he was. After his friend Douglas Royce was slain by the Eye-Killers, servants of the Darkholders, King investigated the cult's activities, ultimately learning that they were in the service of Dracula. When Dracula attempted to possess the Darkhold, King joined the Scarlet Witch and Captain Marvel (Monica Rambeau) of the Avengers in delaying Dracula while Doctor Strange removed the Darkhold from Avengers Mansion. King then joined Blade and Frank Drake in holding Dracula back long enough for Dr. Strange to use the Darkhold's Montesi Formula to destroy all of Earth's vampires. King had been prepared to sacrifice his life, but instead, Dr. Strange was able to transform him back into a human via a complete blood transfusion because he had resisted his bloodlust.King continued as a private detective with Drake and Blade, eventually founding Borderline Investigations with them; but when the Montesi Formula weakened, King began to revert to a vampire-like state, fracturing his friendship with Blade. During a battle with the vampire lord Varnae and Bloodstorm (a clone of Dracula), King and Drake were seemingly slain when Drake's Exorcist gun overloaded; however, the explosion apparently merged them with Bloodstorm into a new host body for Dracula. Dracula ultimately drove them from his body, and King resumed his detective career. King's recent cases have included aiding Brother Voodoo and Blade against Marie LaVeau, and recovering Simon Garth, the Zombie from Lilith on behalf of Donna Garth. CIA agent Tatjana Stiles hired King to investigate the vampire Navarro, who had stolen biological weapons; but Navarro captured King, forcing him to feed on a live human by threatening to make the victim a vampire instead. King and Tatjana ultimately destroyed Navarro, but Tatjana was horribly injured. She begged King to make her a vampire in order to save her, and King gave in, taking his second human life.",

      "biography": "Not much has been revealed regarding the early life and origin of Cardinal, the mercenary identity of Joshua Donald Clendenon. Presumably of a military background, Clendenon had a daughter, Valerie Barnhardt, who would later join the marines.Clendenon was the leader of the mercenary group known as the Air Force, a band of individuals using winged body armor as their signature motif. The Air Force clashed with the New Warriors during the course of their missions and were repeatedly defeated.On one such occasion Clendenon attacked the Taylor Foundation Board of Directors after being hired by Ms. Hancock. When he boarded the plane he was attacked by his ex-girlfriend Sprocket, who happened to be the plane’s pilot. After disabling most of the crew, Tanager went into the back and confronted Dwayne Taylor, Night Thrasher. Using Tanager’s helmet, Dwayne was able to control the other members of Air Force. He then threatened the Air Force into participating in African relief efforts. During his time in Africa, Clendenon was genuinely moved by the suffering of the continent's starving refugees and worked diligently to aid the needy, but his work ended disastrously when the radical right-wing organization Undertow tried to massacre the refugees. During the battle with Undertow's superhuman Soldiers of Misfortune, Clendenon was badly wounded. His close friend Sparrow was captured, and the rest of the Air Force was killed. Subsequent attempts by Clendenon and the New Warriors to rescue Sparrow were unsuccessful, though the Warriors did eventually succeed in freeing one of their own members, Namorita, from Undertow's custody.Embittered by these experiences, Clendenon decided to abandon his flirtation with heroism and dedicate himself exclusively to the pursuit of profit. This led him to join the Crimson Cowl's Masters of Evil in their plot to blackmail the world's governments with a weather control device, but he was defeated and captured by the Thunderbolts along with most of the other Masters.Later, when the Thunderbolts' leader Hawkeye was incarcerated at Seagate prison for illegal vigilante activities, Clendenon was one of many inmates who tried in vain to kill the resourceful hero. More recently, Clendenon was freed from prison by the Crimson Cowl to rejoin the Masters, participating in their new world conquest scheme; in return, the Cowl promised Clendenon she would destroy Hawkeye, whom Clendenon held responsible for the recent death of his daughter Valerie Barnes, who as Meteorite had joined the Thunderbolt's interim team called the Redeemers but was killed in the line of duty.The Masters of Evil were confronted by Hawkeye and his allies Songbird and Plantman (as Blackheath) who were searching for the legacy of criminal industrialist Justin Hammer. Their search ended with Hammer's daughter, Justine, who turned out to be the Crimson Cowl. Hawkeye convinced Clandenon and other members of the Masters of Evil to side with him against Crimson Cowl and their former allies, pointing out the dangers of the super-weapon, a biological toxin that threatened to kill any villain who had ever worked with Hammer, which included Clendenon. Hoping to throw off suspicion, Hawkeye made the villains reinvent their costumed identities, and Clendenon joined his new team of Thunderbolts as Harrier, although he still harbored a grudge against Hawkeye over the fate of his daughter.The group ultimately defeated the Cowl and her Masters of Evil, and Blackheath managed to release an antidote into the atmosphere instead. During the battle, Clendenon appeared to drop Hawkeye from a great height, but this was proved to be the work of the villain Machinesmith who controlled the Harrier armor. The Thunderbolts immediately fought against the Elite Agents of SHIELD who caught up with them and wanted the remains of Blackheath's body, although he soon revived himself. The Thunderbolts were aided by the arrival of the true Citizen V, who needed the team's immediate help with his agency's ship-- the engines of which were made of alien technology that had began distorting, threatening to suck the Earth into the null space of a white hole. Hawkeye's Thunderbolts were asked to move a great quantity of mass to plug the hole. In so doing, the Thunderbolts encountered the original Thunderbolts, who emerged from the void after severing the alien ship's presence from where they had been trapped on Counter-Earth. The two teams of Thunderbolts combined forces to plug the void and shunt the alien ship from Earth, similar to the manner in which Zemo's team stopped the threat on Counter-Earth.After much discussion, most of the costumed heroes and villains chose to part company, including Clendenon, who made peace with Hawkeye and chose to return to prison in order to serve the remainder of his sentence.",

      "biography": "Harry Osborn is perhaps Peter Parker's first true friend. His upbringing was radically different from Peter's as his life was rich in financial assets, but lacking the nurturing warmth of the Parker home. The son of the ruthless industrialist, Norman Osborn, founder of Osborn Industries and Oscorp, Harry lost his mother, Emily, before he turned one year old. Norman had little time for his son, and was frustrated by Harry's failure to demonstrate academic excellence or a competitive drive. Harry was unaware that his father had been permanently altered by a chemical explosion and had assumed a secretive criminal lifestyle as the nefarious Green Goblin. Harry graduated from Standard High and, along with friend Gwen Stacy, went to Empire State University (ESU). There, Harry and Gwen became friends with Midtown High's star football player, Flash Thompson. Harry and Gwen also met studious Peter Parker, also from Midtown High, and misunderstood Peter to be a snob, due to urgent matters that prevented Peter from being friendlier. In time, the misunderstandings were forgiven, and Harry and Peter became friends. Harry invited Peter to move in to his apartment, rent-free thanks to his father's wealth. Peter was able to repay Harry by helping him as a tutor. While Harry and Gwen socialized with Peter and aspiring model Mary Jane Watson, Peter and Gwen began to date and fall in love. Mary Jane dated Harry, though she found flirting with Peter, the man she secretly knew was Spider-Man, irresistible. Mary Jane's antics infuriated Harry. With the pressure of school, his father's high expectations, and rejection from Mary Jane, Harry turned to illegal drugs. On a high, Harry told Mary Jane he forgave her for flirting with Peter, but she reacted indignantly and broke up with him. Harry initially blamed his breakup on Peter for stealing Mary Jane's attention from him. Peter found out Harry had overdosed on LSD, and sought medical attention. Peter then confronted and beat up Harry's drug pusher, delivering the message that he should never return. Norman, meanwhile, had recovered from an amnesiac state regarding his life as the Green Goblin, and clashed with Spider-Man. Spider-Man forced the Goblin to see his hospitalized son, snapping Norman out of his Goblin persona.Harry returned home, in a fragile state, with Mary Jane's presence a burden on his heart. Norman once again became the Green Goblin, and killed Gwen Stacy. Witnessing his father's apparent death battling Spider-Man, Harry was driven to the brink of madness. While no one was watching, he removed his father's mask and costume before the police discovered the body. Harry held Spider-Man responsible for his father's death. Sometime later, Harry discovered his roommate's costume and secret identity. Insane and full of hate, he donned his father's costume and attacked Spider-Man as the new Green Goblin. With no superhuman powers, he was quickly defeated. Spider-Man removed the Goblin costume and paraphernalia from Harry before Harry was taken into custody. The police did not believe Harry's ravings that he was the Green Goblin since he looked too young. They therefore also did not believe Harry's claims that Peter was Spider-Man. Harry was sent into psychiatric care under Dr. Barton Hamilton. Hamilton successfully cured Harry of his insanity, and induced him into forgetting about his life as the Goblin, and hence his knowledge of Spider-Man's secret identity. Harry returned home, and was reunited with his friends. He met Liz Allan, Peter's friend from Midtown High. The two began dating. Liz left for a short time, ashamed that Harry would not want to be with her after she was caught stealing for the sake of her step-brother, the Molten Man. Harry, however, accepted her when she returned to him.Under hypnosis Harry had revealed everything about the Green Goblin to Dr. Hamilton. Coveting the Goblin's power, Hamilton eventually decided to become the Green Goblin himself. Taking Harry prisoner, Hamilton infiltrated New York's criminal underworld as the Goblin and subsequently encountered Spider-Man. Harry escaped captivity and also assumed the identity of the Goblin. Hamilton knocked Harry unconscious, but was then killed by the explosion of a bomb with which he had tried to kill both Harry and Spider-Man. Upon reviving, Harry had again lost the memory of being the Green Goblin, and Spider-Man's secret identity. Soon afterwards, Harry became the successor to his father and president of Osborn Industries. He eloped with Liz Allan, and moved first to Long Island and then to a large house in Englewood, New Jersey, seeking a peaceful life. Harry and Peter drifted apart during this time, but were reunited by the return of the Molten Man and rise of the Hobgoblin (Roderick Kingsley) threatening the Osborn family with demands for his father's strength enhancing serum. After a difficult labor brought on by the trauma of facing the Hobgoblin, Liz gave birth to a son, Norman Harold Osborn, and asked Peter and Mary Jane to be the godparents. When the Parkers were evicted from their apartment, Harry and Liz took them in as tenants. To defend his family from the Hobgoblin, Harry resumed his role as the Green Goblin. The stress began to take its toll, as Harry gradually lost mental stability again and returned to menacing Spider-Man as the Green Goblin. He kidnapped Mary Jane, and took her to the top of the Brooklyn Bridge where Gwen had died. Mary Jane refused to beg for her life, startling Harry to remember the love he felt for her, and promised that she and Aunt May would be kept safe in the war between him and Spider-Man. Harry remembered Peter's secret identity, and played mind games with Peter, making living in the apartment below the Osborns very uncomfortable. Hoping to get revenge on all those who had betrayed his father, Harry created the Norman Osborn Foundation, and invited his father's former associates together in one townhouse, wired to explode and kill them all. He enhanced his strength taking a version of the Goblin serum, and tried to kill Spider-Man once and for all. While Spider-Man and the Green Goblin traded blows, Mary Jane and Normie Jr. were inside the townhouse. Harry raced inside to save them before the building exploded. He succeeded; however, the new formula was a failure, poisoning him. In his final moments before death, Harry reverted back to being Peter's friend, and saved his life.Before his death, however, Harry had planted a trap for Spider-Man whereby he funded the Chameleon to create life-models of Peter's parents. These replicas were so realistic, that they fooled Peter and his Aunt May. Spider-Man was emotionally devastated to discover the truth and Harry's involvement, and the replicas were destroyed. Sometime later, Spider-Man discovered within an abandoned Goblin warehouse a device which projected Harry's recorded memories into Peter's mind. Peter saw in his mind himself playing the roles of young Norman Osborn facing an abusive father as Harry had envisioned it, as well as recollections from Harry's youth. According to these recorded memories, unbeknownst to Norman, Harry had sabotaged the original Goblin formula, bitter at his father for consistently choosing work as a priority over his son.Ex-Daily Bugle reporter Ben Urich chronicled the history of the Green Goblin in his book \"Legacy of Evil\" which Norman Osborn discredited. However, with Norman's identity publicly revealed, Urich's credibility has been restored.In the aftermath of Spider-Man accepting an offer from Mephisto to save the life of his Aunt May in exchange for the elimination of his marriage from the timeline of history, Harry has somehow returned to life. Divorced from Liz and two others, he has returned from a years-long stay in a European rehab. He has no memory of being the Green Goblin, nor of Peter Parker's alter-ego. Harry is now the owner of a chain of cafes based on his old college hangout, the \"Coffee Bean\" and, while he considers Peter his best friend, he hates Spider-Man with a vengeance. He is currently dating Lily Hollister, friend of NYPD's forensic specialist Carlie Cooper and daughter of New York, District Attorney, Bill Hollister. During the New York Mayoral Election, in the campaign headquarters of Bill Hollister, Harry stumbled upon Lily, while she was transforming from her alter-ego as Menace, the mysterious villain, who had been attacking the candidates for mayor. Harry was shocked, and upset with the incredible revelation, but he was even more fascinated to learn that Lily knew of his father's hidden labs and horrendous secrets. She revealed that while searching through the lab in New Jersey, she accidentally broke a vile containing the Goblin serum and it was absorbed into her skin, allowing her to transform into the Goblin, and not having the need for a mask. In an attempt to stop Lily, Harry donned the Green Goblin once again, and injected Lily with a serum that reversed the affects of the serum that she previously been exposed to.",

      "biography": "Animus' origins are not revealed: it may be a mutant or mutated human, the spawn of the cosmic Lord Chaos or Master Hate, or something else altogether. In its first recorded activity as the Hate-Monger, it provided advanced weaponry and costumes to Leonard Kryzewski, convincing him to regather the Sons of the Serpent to spread hatred and violence throughout New York City. The Avengers and New Warriors opposed the Sons, and the Hate-Monger escalated tensions into violence between all groups. In a later conflict, the Hate-Monger faded away when Captain America convinced the heroes to overcome their hatred, but it warned them it would be back when their resolve faded and hatred flourished in their hearts. The Hate-Monger next appeared in the Los Angeles riots.  After the riots, it targeted Nomad (Jack Monroe), inflaming conflicts with supporters of the homophobic broadcaster the Roar, the HIV injecting Needle, and Texas Senator Hugh Greider. It eventually confronted Nomad directly, even using his infant ward Bucky (Julia Winter) against him, but Nomad ended the conflict by refusing to fight the Hate-Monger.Returning to L.A., the Hate Monger supplied high-tech weapons to street gang the War Machines. After being assaulted and warned away from the gang by War Machine, the Hate-Monger led the Sons of the Serpent to purchase weapons from A.I.M. and Hydra and use them against streets gangs, such as the War Machines, resulting in another conflict with War Machine. Rhodes framed the Sons as having betrayed A.I.M. and Hydra, turning both groups against the Sons, and the Hate-Monger fled. It next assaulted the hero Justice, exploiting Justice and his mother's hatred of Vance for having accidentally killed his own abusive father. When Norma forgave Vance, and enabled him to get over his self-loathing, the Hate-Monger was foiled. Re-naming itself Animus, it fed off tensions among the Hulk, Hulk|Bruce Banner, Angela Lipscombe, and Doc Samson. When Animus confronted them directly, Banner used his own hatred to overload and consume Animus, though Animus soon re-formed and prepared for dessert.",

      "biography": "Alexander Summers is the younger of the two sons of Christopher Summers, a United States Air Force Major and test pilot, and his wife Katherine Anne. The family were flying back from a vacation in their vintage airplane when they crashed into a scout ship of the intergalactic Shi'ar Empire, setting the wooden plane ablaze. Their mother pushed the brothers out of the burning plane with the only available parachute, allowing them to escape capture by the aliens.The two boys were hospitalized for injuries they sustained during their landing.  Alex left the hospital after two weeks and was placed in an orphanage in Omaha, Nebraska that was secretly run by the master geneticist Mister Sinister. Alex was soon adopted by the Blanding family, who had lost their son Todd. However, the family were still traumatized by their loss, and treated Alex as if he were Todd. (Unknown to Alex, his brother Scott would become the hero Cyclops and join the X-Men.) Sinister continued to monitor Alex whilst he lived with his foster family.  When he noticed the first stirrings of Alex's mutant powers, Sinister incited the local school bully Vincent, who had caused Todd's accident, to attack Alex.  The subsequent stress caused Alex's mutant powers to manifest and he incinerated Vincent.  Sinister then placed a genetic lock upon Alex to curtail the development of his powers.As a result, Alex did not become aware of his mutant abilities until after graduating college. A professor of archaeology named Ahmet Abdol had discovered a psychic link between himself and Alex. While both of them had the latent mutant power to absorb and transform cosmic radiation, Abdol's ability to exercise the power was blocked in an unknown manner by Alex. Abdol captured Alex and took him to his laboratory in Egypt. There, Abdol found a way to screen Alex's body from ambient cosmic radiation, permitting his own body to attain its latent potential. Abdol was transformed into the Living Monolith, a gigantic mutant with vast cosmic power, but was defeated when his brother and the X-Men came to the rescue. Incapable of controlling the power his body emanated, Alex fled into the Egyptian desert.Alex was soon captured by one of the mutant-hunting robotic Sentinels and brought to the headquarters of Larry Trask, son of the Sentinels' inventor Bolivar Trask. Larry gave Alex the codename Havok and a costume whose chest display monitored the build-up of cosmic energy within him. The X-Men came to Alex’s rescue; however, he was injured in the ensuing battle with the Sentinels and was taken to Doctor Karl Lykos for treatment.  Lykos was himself a mutant who fed off the life energies of other mutants, and when he siphoned energy from Alex he transformed for the first time into the flying reptilian creature named Sauron.After Sauron was defeated, Alex returned to New York with his brother and his teammates where he joined the X-Men and began training to control his powers. Eventually, Alex gained enough mastery over his power that he would release it only when he wished to do so and could wield his power with enough skill to become a formidable opponent in battle.During his time with the X-Men, Alex fell in love with his teammate Lorna Dane, the magnetism-manipulating mutant now known as Polaris.  They both served for a time in the X-Men helping to repel the invasion by the alien Z'nox; however, neither Alex nor Lorna wished to lead a life as an adventurer. They discovered a mutual interest in geophysics and left the X-Men to begin doctoral research in the Diablo mountain range in Arizona.Their idyllic lifestyle was eventually interrupted when the pair found themselves hunted by the team of superhuman assassins known as the Marauders. Lorna was possessed by the psionic entity known as Malice, who forced her to attack the X-Men as the Marauders’ leader.  Alex, who had rejoined the X-Men, had no choice but to fight his lover.Later, Alex traveled through the Siege Perilous, a mystic gateway that granted those who passed through it a new lease on life, free of their past baggage.  When he reappeared, it was as a member of the Magistrates of the mutant-enslaving island nation of Genosha.  After the X-Men overthrew the Genoshan government, Alex remained behind for a time to ensure the new government wouldn't repeat the mistakes of the former administration.  He later accepted an offer to lead the second version of X-Factor, a government-funded mutant agency, of which Lorna was a member.Alex continued to serve with X-Factor until the apparent death of his teammate Jamie Madrox, the Multiple Man, at the hands of the prophetic mutant named Haven. Disillusioned, Alex teamed up with the Dark Beast, an evil doppelganger of the X-Men's Beast from another timeline, and together they founded a team of mutant terrorists called the Brotherhood of Mutants. However, Alex had not truly become a villain and had only joined the Brotherhood in order to stop the Dark Beast's sinister plans.  After he was aided by the time-traveling Xavier Underground Enforcers in stopping the Dark Beast, Alex joined them in their quest to stop their apocalyptic future from occurring.  Alex was seemingly killed when a time machine created by X.U.E. member Greystone exploded, but he was actually shunted into an alternate universe, trading bodies with the Havok of that reality.  However, Alex's family and friends all believed him dead.After adventuring with a team of twisted versions of the heroes he once knew, Alex again seemingly died, but was left floating in a Limbo-like void.  On Alex's Earth, a catatonic \"John Doe\" patient at the Rosy Manor Convalescent Hospital in upstate New York was identified as being Alex Summers by his attending nurse, Annie Ghazikanian. After she contacted the X-Men, Cyclops came to collect his brother, and Annie sought to accompany Alex as she had come to care for him and sought to continue his rehabilitation.Alex was eventually saved by Annie's young son Carter, who used his fledgling mutant powers to reconnect Alex's consciousness to his body. Seizing the day, Alex's long-time love Lorna asked him to marry her.  Somewhat shocked at such a life-altering question so soon after his return, Alex faltered over a reply but his assembled friends and family made the decision for him.  However, Alex had fallen in love with Annie, and called off his wedding as Lorna was walking up the aisle.  Lorna snapped and attempted to kill both Alex and his newfound love, but she was stopped by Alex's teammate the Juggernaut.Soon after, the alternate reality Havok's personality resurfaced within Alex, having followed Alex's consciousness back from within the void in which he had been trapped.  The team of dimension-hopping mutants known as the Exiles were charged with the task of stopping the evil Havok, and they teamed up with the X-Men to prevent him from killing Carter.  The evil consciousness was eventually forced out of Alex's body and sent back into the void where it was destroyed by the Exiles' taskmaster, the enigmatic being known as the Timebroker.Recently, following the Scarlet Witch's alteration of House of M|reality, many mutants were left powerless, including Polaris. She chose to leave the X-Men, and Havok decided to accompany her. During an encounter with the creature called Daap, Polaris was abducted and Havok returned to the X-Men.",

      "biography": "Alex Summers was six years old when his father flew his family to Canada as a birthday surprise for his mother. Along the way, their aircraft was attacked by a Shi'ar spacecraft. Their father gave his two sons the only parachute and, clinging on to his older brother Scott, Alex and Scott jumped out of the aircraft leaving their parents to their own fate. The Summers brothers were taken to a nearby orphanage run by Sinister, who later adopted the two of them as his own sons. Scott became Sinister's favorite son which drove a wedge between Scott and Alex, who quickly became jealous of his brother. Sinister would train his two sons every day and weld them into becoming the finest of Apocalypse's soldiers.  Alex and Scott were both given the title of Prelate. In the meantime, their father, Christopher, managed to escape from the Shi'ar empire and returned to Earth in a stolen aircraft. Unfortunately he was also infected with a Brood egg. His aircraft was captured by Infinites and he was sent to Sinister, who kept his return secret from Alex and Scott. After years of being experimented on, Christopher managed to escape and Sinister ordered his Elite Mutant Force to recapture him. Alex and Scott located Christopher in the \"Ghost Lands\" where he revealed that he was their father. Although Christopher told his sons the story of how they got separated, Scott remained unconvinced but Alex believed he was really their father. Their reunion was cut short however when, during a battle between some scavengers, Christopher's Brood egg hatched and Scott was forced to kill his own father to save him. This act would only cause a further rift to appear between Alex and Scott. Havok became a regular at Angel's nightclub \"Heaven\" and began an affair with its singer, Scarlett McKenzie. Due to the fact that Scarlett wasn't a mutant, Havok was forced to keep this affair a secret to avoid being accused of miscegenation. Havok was unaware that Scarlett was secretly working for the Human High Council. When Weapon X and Jean Grey  infiltrated Apocalypse's Atlantic Sea Wall, they clashed with Havok. During the battle, Havok was accidentally fused with a Sentinel when they both entered a transporter together. Beast was later forced to remove the parts of the Sentinel with a bone-saw. In the meantime, Sinister's betrayal of Apocalypse became open and Cyclops put himself in charge, much to Havok's annoyance. Havok began to investigate the mysterious escapes from the breeding pens. He interrogated a witness to one of the escapes called Lorna Dane who told him that Magneto was the one responsible for the escapes. Frustrated, Havok sent her to the Beast who tortured her into telling him the truth. She was rescued by Cyclops and sent back to the breeding pens. Later that night, Cyclops, in disguise, helped Lorna escape from the pens. Unbeknownst to Cyclops, Havok was observing this occurrence from a distance. He now had the information necessary to remove Cyclop's authority and take control of the Elite Mutant Force himself. Jean Grey returned to the pens in search of Sinister, who recently supplied information of Apocalypse's plans to the Human High Council, but was captured by Havok. When Cyclops saw Jean was a prisoner of the Beast, he refused Havok's order to kill her and was captured by Sam Guthrie. As this was occurring, Scarlett realized that she was pregnant with Havok's child when she became ill during one of her performances. However it was also discovered that she was working for the Human High Council and she was captured. When word reached Apocalypse that Havok succeeded Cyclops as commander of the pens, he ordered that every prisoner should be culled. Cyclops and Jean managed to escape and tried to free the prisoners by destroying the Brain Trust. The Brain Trust psionically anesthetized the prisoners so they lacked the will to escape. After destroying the Brain Trust, Cyclops and Jean encountered Havok. As brother battled brother, Cyclops got the upper hand and knocked Havok unconscious. After freeing the prisoners, Jean used her telepathic powers to prevent the Human High Council's missiles from destroying New York City. However Havok sneaked up behind Jean and used his powers to kill her before killing Cyclops. His revenge was short-lived however when Weapon X killed Havok in vengeance.",

While there, Clint trained with a bow and arrow under the tutelage of Trickshot, the carnival marksman. During this time, Bernard left Clint behind and ended up becoming an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Taking the stage name Hawkeye, Clint stayed with the carnival until it shut down during the initial stages of the Mutant-Human Wars.With no place else to turn, Clint searched for his brother. When he discovered Bernard had been killed during a mutant battle, Clint became enraged. He decided to stand up to his mutant oppressors. His travels took him to New York City, where he was recruited by Luke Cage as a part of his underworld organization. Recently, Clint has been experiencing unexplained blackouts. Their cause is unknown. Personal Weaponry: Hawkeye is a master archer, and is trained in the use of regular bows, longbows, compound bows, and crossbows.

      "biography": "A former Olympic archer, Clint Barton became a U.S. intelligence agent over a decade ago. Active around the world, he was present for the liberations of Kosovo and Afghanistan, as well as the fall of the Berlin Wall. He became a close friend and frequent colleague of fellow agent Nick Fury, and the two operatives were key founders of the modern intelligence agency S.H.I.E.L.D. Both rose through the ranks until Fury became the agency's director and Barton (code-named Hawkeye) became an elite agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s black ops division, often partnered with ex-KGB espionage legend Natasha Romanov (code-named Black Widow). Despite his dangerous, globe-spanning profession, Barton managed to build a more stable family life than most of his peers, residing for years with his girlfriend Laura (who recently became his wife), with whom he had three children: Callum, Lewis and baby Nicole, named after her godfather, Nick Fury. Hawkeye habitually phoned his family before every mission to say good-bye, just in case he never returned. He always returned, even after a mission which pitted him, Black Widow, and their support team against two office buildings full of extraterrestrial Chitauri sleeper agents. Most of their team died, but Hawkeye, the Widow and a handful of others survived, wiping out the Chitauri sleepers in the process. Shortly thereafter, Hawkeye and the Widow were promoted to membership in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s new celebrity superhero team, the Ultimates, complete with newly falsified backgrounds to make them more acceptable public figures. When the Ultimates thwarted a Chitauri plot to destroy Earth, thanks in part to unwitting assistance from the monstrous Hulk, it was a wounded Hawkeye who managed to bring down the rampaging Hulk once the aliens were defeated. Hawkeye participated in many more Ultimates operations before taking part in the team's most controversial mission to date, teaming with the European Super-Soldier Initiative to strip a \"rogue\" state of its nuclear weapons capability. In response, a traitor within the Ultimates led a black ops team in to Hawkeye's home, slaughtering the entire Barton family. Though apparently slain alongside his family, Hawkeye's body was missing from the crime scene when the authorities arrived.",

      "biography": "In her home reality, Heather Hudson was heading up a cutting edge experiment using gamma rays to combat cancer cells when the experiment went horribly wrong. After absorbing a lethal amount of gamma radiation Heather found she could transform into the creature known as Sasquatch. With her new abilities she was invited to join the Canadian super-team Alpha Flight. Her first assignment was to capture a wild monster roaming the Canadian wilderness. That monster turned out to be Wolverine, and Heather was able to capture and subdue him. Sasquatch and Wolverine stayed with Alpha Flight and eventually married. Alpha Flight became a major force throughout the world but things would eventually deteriorate. Wolverine went insane when a chip in his adrenal gland was activated. Heather tried to reason with him but was forced to kill her husband. Heather was devastated. Eventually, James Hudson was able to draw her out of her shell. She missed Logan but she and James eventually married. Heather would become Alpha Flight's leader.In time Heather was ripped from her reality by the mysterious man known as the Timebroker. He told her she had become unhinged from time and would have to help fix the broken chains of reality. If she didn't help, Hudson would be burned to death in a tragic accident in her reality.As Sasquatch, Heather would help the Exiles complete many missions. Following a fight with vampire versions of the Avengers, the team was separated by a magical spell. Sasquatch and Morph were dropped into a reality at the exact moment that reality's Wolverine escaped from the Weapon X Program. Afraid for Morph's life, Sasquatch knocked him out and hid him. Wolverine quickly tracked Sasquatch, but before the two could fight, Heather reverted to her human form. Wolverine stopped dead in his tracks. Before they could harm each other, Heather was teleported away and reunited with the Exiles.During a mission when the Exiles were forced to face off against their reality-hopping counterparts, Weapon X, Sasquatch was mortally wounded by her teammate, Magik. Heather saved Nocturne's life, pushing her out of the way of Magik's sword slash. Bleeding to death, Nocturne possessed Heather and transformed her into Sasquatch, allowing her healing powers to kick in.Recently, a visit to a mystically empowered reality revealed that the true source of Sasquatch's power was not gamma radiation but actually Tanaraq, a Great Beast of the North. The Great Beast took over her body. She would have remained under Tanaraq's influence if not for the magic of Alpha Flight's Shaman. Unfortunately, Heather lost the ability to transform into Sasquatch. Recently, Heather has been acting as a mission control for the team, remaining at the crystal palace and giving the team information on their missions.",

      "biography": "Julian Keller was leader of the Hellions, the Xavier Institute training squad instructed by co-headmaster Emma Frost. His young age notwithstanding, Keller has already learned to employ his genetic mutation in a variety of inventive ways, including flight and concussive force blasts as well as the creation of telekinetic shields and transport platforms. Always looking for trouble, he was involved (along with Josh Foley) in reviving Magma and nearly incinerating the medical wing, as well as turning away Noriko Ashida Surge II) because she was dirty. He was originally an advisee of Northstar, but his constant punishments caused him to switch advisors to Emma Frost, who sees in him great potential for heroism as well as a frightening disposition for personal gain and villainy, Julian named himself 'Hellion' in tribute to the former White Queen's first class of students (who had been killed by Trevor Fitzroy). Hellion has demonstrated quite a significant interest in Sofia Mantega, the half-Venezuelan co-leader of the rival New Mutants squad. He is particularly hard on David Alleyne, the New Mutants' other leader, whom he views as possessing a particularly useless mutant power and as a genuine competitor as a leader and strategist. However, for the school dance, he dated all three Stepford Cuckoos.True to his namesakes, Hellion is hard-pressed to stay out of trouble. He led his squad to try and rescue Kevin Ford (Wither) from FBI custody, but they were stopped by the New Mutants squad before they could interact with the government agents. Julian has a major crush on Sofia (Wind Dancer) though they lead rival squads. Hellion is arrogant and vocal about it, but he does possess a talent for leadership, as evidenced by his squad's winning of the first school Field Day prize.Following the end of school, Julian invited his squad to his parents' house in California. Getting a boy made of rock and a girl made of metal onto a plane proved difficult, and Hellion started a minor brawl with airport security. After standing down, he called his family lawyer and got the Department of Homeland Security to let them on the plane. On arrival at his house, however, his parents were disappointed in the public embarrassment he caused and effectively disowned him. Julian was livid, and recalled that his parents' wealth happened very suddenly, so he broke into their safe and found documents about a \"Kingmaker,\" and the Hellions summoned him.The Kingmaker arrived and agreed to grant the Hellions one wish. Julian wished for fame and glory, and soon was in a position to save the Governor of California from a sniper. In return, the Hellions were asked to bring the Kingmaker a biological weapon from Genetassist, Inc., which he planned to give to Dr. Octopus. Hellion led the raid, taking out Diamondback and Paladin in the process, and retrieved the canister. However, Hellion only agreed to give it to the Kingmaker in return for voiding their contracts. When the Kingmaker agreed, Hellion attacked, and with his full squad managed to defeat the villain, in the process also destroying the biological weapon before turning it over to S.H.I.E.L.D.Following the advent of House of M|\"M-Day\", all of the students still with powers were forced by Emma into an all-out brawl, and the ones deemed to be the best were assigned to become a group of in-training X-Men. Julian was among those students that made the grade. \nRecently, after hearing about the death of their teammate Icarus, the New X-men took it upon themselves to destroy Nimrod once and for all. During the fight with Nimrod, X-23 was severely injured and was unable to heal herself. So Julian decided to fly her to the mansion, he knew that he would not make it in time, so he contacted Emma Frost mentally and asked for her help. She helped him by removing the mental blocks in his mind that kept him from using his powers to his full potential. Because of this Julian made it to the mansion in time to get Elixir to heal her. The removal of the mental blocks caused severe physical injuries however, and he was last seen asleep and watched over by X-23, who left seemingly hurt when a still dreaming Julian spoke Sofia's name. After Julian regained his strength, Beast brought Julian into the empty Danger Room to test the limits of his powers after getting the mental blocks removed. Julian accidentally blew up the floor of the Danger room, while picking up a paper clip. Beast suggested that he practiced away from the students until Marvel Girl returned from space. After speaking with Beast, Julian began to search for Cessily, who had been gone with Laura for a long time. When entering the room of Cessily and Dust, Julian saw Laura, who was preparing to leave the mansion to get her. Though Laura was reluctant, Julian came along with her. After finding a hideout for the facility that made  X-23, Julian watched Laura interrogate a man at gun point who may have known where the facility was. After Laura got the information she needed she shot the man. Julian argued with her by saying that, if they were going to look for Mercury, they where going to need a different way of interrogating. \nSoon after, Julian was severely wounded during an attack on the X-Mansion and later, also, the New X-Men disbanded. Recently Julian suffered another severe injury to his hands after an attack by Nimrod_(Sentinel)'s.",

However, after Shi'ar commander T'kyll Alabar slaughtered the women of a Mephitisoid abbey, a distillation of their pheromone control powers enabled the Shi'ar to conquer the Mephitisoid people. The Shi'ar quarantined the Mephitisoids on their homeworld under martial law, fostering a bitter hatred of the Shi'ar and leading to numerous revolts.Centuries later, imprisoned in the Slave Pits of Alsibar, Hepzibah encountered the human Christopher Summers. Her torture at the hands of her jailers caused Summers to rebel alongside Hepzibah, Ch’od, Cr+eee, and Raza. The quintet escaped the Pits, stole a starship, and went on to form the Starjammers, a team of interstellar pirates led by Summers - as the swashbuckling Corsair - who operate mostly within the Shi'ar Galaxy. Hepzibah was given her alias by Corsair named after a beautiful female skunk in an Earth comic strip.During her time as the Starjammers' weapons officer, Hepzibah and Corsair fell in love, and it was not long before she took him as her mate and the pair were bonded for life. However, Hepzibah's long-festering hatred of the Shi'ar strained her relationship with Corsair. While aiding the Shi'ar against the threat of the alien Uncreated, Corsair was forced to re-route control of Hepzibah's weapons station in order to prevent her from firing on a Shi'ar ship. After the battle, all criminal charges against the Starjammers were dropped by Shi'ar Empress Lilandra. Seizing the opportunity, Corsair chose to retire with Hepzibah and live a normal life. Their happiness was cut short, though, after they and the other Starjammers were captured by the Collector. They escaped with the help of the X-Man Wolverine and resumed their pirating ways.",

      "biography": "Hercules is the son of Zeus, king of the gods of Olympus, and Alcmena, a mortal woman who lived about three thousand years ago. Recognizing the need for a son who would be powerful enough to defend both the Olympian gods and humanity from future dangers he foresaw, Zeus seduced Alcmena in the guise of her husband, King Amphitryon of Troezen. Thanks to Zeus's enchantment, Hercules was born with the potential for extraordinary strength, which he first displayed before he was even one year old by strangling two serpents which attacked him. As an adult, Hercules is best known for his celebrated Twelve Labors, which were performed in part to prove his worthiness for immortality to Zeus. (One of these Labors, the cleansing of the Aegean Stables, was actually performed by the Eternal called the Forgotten One, who was sometimes mistaken for Hercules.)\n\nIn the course of these Labors, Hercules provoked the wrath of three immortals who remain his enemies to this day. By slaughtering the man-eating Stymphalian Birds, he enraged the war god Ares, to whom they were sacred. In temporarily capturing Cerberus, the three-headed hound that serves as guardian to the Olympian underworld (not to be confused with the shape-shifting giant of the same name), Hercules offended Pluto, the lord of that realm. By killing the Nemean Lion, the Hydra, and other creatures spawned by the inconceivably grotesque and powerful monster Typhoeus, Hercules gained the bitter enmity of Typhon, the immortal humanoid offspring of Typhoeus and a Titaness.\n\nHowever, it was the centaur Nessus who caused Hercules's mortal demise. Nessus kidnapped Hercules's wife Deianeira, whereupon Hercules shot him with an arrow. Feigning a wish to make amends, the dying centaur told Deianeira how to make a love charm from his allegedly enchanted blood, aware that it was now tainted with the lethal poison of the Hydra, in which Hercules had dipped his arrows. Some time after Nessus's death, Deianeira, distraught over her husband's latest infidelity, rubbed the supposed love charm into Hercules's shirt. When Hercules's donned the shirt, the poison quickly worked and caused Hercules great pain. In an attempt to end this pain, he built a funeral pyre for himself and set it ablaze. Zeus intervened however, consuming the pyre with his thunderbolts and bringing Hercules to Olympus to be made a true immortal.\n\nIn an alternate future of the 23rd century, Hercules is the sole survivor of the Olympians, after Zeus had decided that the time had come for them to leave this plane of existence. Hercules then left Olympus to become the father to a new race of gods.",

      "biography": "In 1928, college student Herbert Edgar Wyndham, inspired by heretical biologist Nathaniel Essex, conducted genetic experiments in his mother's suburban London basement, attempting with limited success to evolve rats in his genetic accelerator. At that year's International Conference on Genetics in Geneva, Switzerland, a mysterious stranger (actually the Inhuman Phaeder, father of Maelstrom) handed Herbert papers containing a blueprint for breaking the genetic code. Documents in hand, Wyndham returned to Oxford University and developed a serum capable of controlled genetic alteration, which he later named Isotope A. His professors frowned on his single-minded focus and Wyndham was expelled in 1930. Returning to his mother's basement, he finally succeeded, evolving his Dalmatian Dempsey to humanoid form, but Dempsey was shot by hunters. In partnership with fellow scientist Jonathan Drew (a Yale arthropod specialist), Wyndham moved to the Eastern Side of Transia's Wundagore Mountain, to land Drew's wife Merriam had inherited from her uncle. Herbert financed a lab for them by selling his mother's home, but their discovery of uranium on the land soon allowed them virtually unlimited finances; they purchased large qualities of land from neighbor Gregor Russoff. German rocket scientist, Horace Grabshied (later Grayson) designed their \"Citadel of Science\" (named Wundagore) in exchange for their financing his rocketry. Grabsheid built a space ship into their base. And subsequently continued upgrading the Citadel. Again Phaedar intervened, bringing Herbert an army of underground dwelling Moloids as a labor force to build the Citadel. Construction proceeded, but Drew's daughter Jessica fell ill in 1931, affected by the radioactive uranium. Herbert and Jonathan cooperated on an emergency treatment, injecting her with Drew's experimental spider serum, subjecting her to Wyndham's evolving ray, and then placing her in extended suspended animation. Merriam Drew was killed by a werewolf on the adjoining Russoff estate; Wyndham was also attacked but survived unscathed, and Jonathan wordlessly left Wundagore. Wyndham designed a suit of protective armor and captured the werewolf (Baron Gregor Russoff). In 1932, Wyndham, with research assistant Miles Warren, developed a newer mutagen, Isotope B and evolved several animals to human form and sentience, his first dozen \"New Men\" including Bova (Guernsey cow), Tagar (tiger), and Porga (pig). Wyndham tinkered with Grabsheid's space flight technology, building fly cycles, anti-graviton atomic steeds that his New Men would ride into battle. Jonathan Drew returned, claiming to be possessed by Arthurian wizard Magnus, a former disciple of Morgan Le Fay. Magnus/Drew warned Wyndham that the Citadel was constructed where Chthon, an ancient demon, had been banished, but Wyndham believed that his partner's grief had driven him mad. Whydham refused to leave and Magnus stayed in Wundagore, each man watching over the other. Miles Warren began his own experiments and after one, an evolved Jackal, escaped into a nearby town, Wyndham asked Warren to leave. Warren convinced several New Men that Wyndham valued them only as experiments, and those New Men left with Warren. Magnus began training the remaining New Men, and over the next several years instilled in them a code of conduct derived from the chivalry of Magnus' youth; these Knights of Wundagore began respectfully referring to Wyndham as the Lord High Evolutionary. However, in 1958, Baron Russoff used the Darkhold, the book by with Chthon had been bound, in an effort to cure himself, allowing Chthon to break free. While the Knights of Wundagore and Wyndham battled Chthon's mystical forces, Magnus managed to rebind Chthon. However, a pregnant woman, Magda, had sought sanctuary in the Citadel, and the delivery of her twin children, midwifed by Bova, coincided with Chthon's defeat; a segment of his powers touched the twins, giving Chthon an avenue of access to our world. Seventeen of the forty New Men died in the battle, as did Russoff. Magda left not long thereafter, asking Bova to find someone to raise her children Wanda and Pietro, and Magnus/Drew also departed. Herbert sent Porga to locate parents for the twins; he brought Americans Robert and Madeline Frank to the citadel. Madeline was pregnant herself, and died while delivering a stillborn child at the Citadel. Bova informed Robert Frank the twins were his, but when she also told him Madeline had died, he fled into the night. Unable to find suitable guardians, Wyndham placed the twins into suspended animation, and years later personally delivered the twins to Porga's next choice, Django and Marya Maximoff, a gypsy couple who had lost their own twins, Ana and Mateo. Several years after that, realizing his New Men needed knowledge of the modern world. Wyndham had Porga recruit a teacher: Jane Foster, an American nurse. Foster's friend Thor invaded Wundagore in search of her and disrupted Wyndham as he was evolving a wolf using a new mutagen, Isotope C. The experiment went awry, creating Man-Beast. The combined efforts of Thor, High Evolutionary, and the New Men barely defeated the Man-Beast (and several men-beasts evolved by Man-Beast himself), and High Evolutionary decided that Earth could never accept his New Men; the Man-Beast and his men-beasts were launched into space towards the Galaxy Dromisana, and the Citadel also launched, traveling out to establish Wundagore II on another planet. A few New Men, including Bova, remained on Earth. The off-Earth New Men were adversely affected by Wundagore II's atmosphere, and began degrading into savagery. Seeking physical help to control them, High Evolutionary had his gatherers capture the Hulk and ship him to Wundagore II. The Hulk could not cope with the sheer numbers of New Men, and in desperation Wyndham treated himself with Isotope D, a mutagen which evolved him into a powerful disembodied intelligence. In this form, High Evolutionary returned the Hulk home and devolved the New Men to animal forms. Wyndham restored himself, now possessing the power to evolve and devolve himself and others. He developed Project Alpha to create a new Earth, fully evolved but free of evil. Building his \"Counter-Earth\" in an orbit directly opposite the sun from his home Earth, he used Infinity Gems to draw elements from Earth, asteroids, space debris, and extra dimensional mass together with graviton rays, subjecting them to seven score hours of treatment with evolutionary bio-rays to create a fully evolved Earth, albeit one artificially held together with only one percent mass of true Earth. The exhausted High Evolutionary napped as the evolution concluded, and the Man-Beast intervened, instilling on Counter-Earth the evil High Evolutionary had so carefully excluded. High Evolutionary decided to destroy Counter-Earth and begin again, but the being known as Him convinced Wyndham to refrain, asking to live on Counter-Earth. High Evolutionary agreed, seeing in Him a like-minded surrogate son, and sent Him to Counter-Earth, gifting him with the Soul Gem, renaming him Warlock, and recruiting a Rigellian Recorder to observe the experiment. High Evolutionary placed Counter-Earth a micro-second out of dimensional synch to hide it from Earth. When the planet-eating Galactus discovered Counter-Earth, Wyndham sought aid from the Fantastic Four and bargained with Galactus, gaining time to find him a new world to devour; High Evolutionary sent the Four to evaluate possible worlds. Believing they had failed, High Evolutionary fought Galactus and was banished to the Negative Zone, but the Four found Galactus a new world in his absence. When Galactus fell ill while devouring this world (Poppup), High Evolutionary temporarily evolved him into a disembodied force. The extra dimensional Beyonders later became interested in Counter-Earth and hired the Pegasusian Planet Movers, led by Sphinxor, to take the planet for them. Sphinxor caused Warlock to believe Counter-Earth was destroyed; in a fit of rage, Warlock attacked High Evolutionary and Wyndham's armor automatically super-evolved him for protection. Sphinxor removed Counter-Earth, and High Evolutionary was restored when Her, a being created in the same manner as Him/Warlock, came seeking Warlock. High Evolutionary tracked down his world, but allowed the Movers to take it in return for being allowed to accompany them; Counter-Earth's inherent instability threatened to one day destroy it, and High Evolutionary wished this fixed. However, the Beyonders were further above High Evolutionary than Wyndham was beyond humanity. Counter-Earth remained in the Beyoders' museum of curiosities, and High Evolutionary returned to Earth where he devolved himself to protoplasm. His armor eventually restored him, and Wyndham decided to evolve humanity to surpass the Beyonders via a genetic bomb. High Evolutionary re-established Wundagore, placing New Man Count Tagar in charge. When the Savage Land was destroyed by the world-dismantling Terminus, the High Evolutionary built a fortress in the Land's ruins, studying the mechanisms placed there by the Nuwali race and their monument to the alien Beyonders. When another Terminus arose, High Evolutionary battled it beside the X-Men, and afterwards created evolutionary terraformers that restored the Savage Land from the mind and biology of Garokk, the Petrified Man, who had previously been attuned to the Land. High Evolutionary saw this as a last chance to enjoy the simple pleasures of uncomplicated creation before engaging in the final stages of his plan to evolutionarily accelerate the entire planet. High Evolutionary briefly aided humanity when the efforts of his old research assistant Miles Warren caused chaos; High Evolutionary altered Warren's notes to prevent humanity from learning the truth about Warren's cloning work, created a second version of the mutated Carrion with false memories to support deception, and later would cure the Carrion Plague which Warren had created. High Evolutionary created an organization consisting of Gatherers collecting genetic data for him, Technicians studying and compiling the data, Purifiers sterilizing those whose genes were unfit, Eliminators killing those who acted against Earth's genetic benefit, and Priests (mostly New Men) managing the project. Notably, his Purifiers sterilized large portions of Earth's subterranean races, though the emergence of a telepathic Moloid named Val-Or, coupled with the interference of Apocalypse, caused High Evolutionary to see that the Moloids still could evolve, and he ended their sterilization. His Purifiers sterilized Earth's more genetically dangerous mutants; his Eliminators acted against the drug trade; and his Gatherers studied the genetic codes of the Eternals, Deviants, Inhumans, Atlanteans, and alien races including Skrulls and Melmacians. As the genetic bomb neared completion, one of High Evolutionary's Technicians warned the Avengers, and Wyndham's dreams were destroyed when the demi-god Hercules was super-evolved to be his equal; under the influence of Evolutionary's machinery, both High Evolutionary and Hercules evolved into disembodied forms. These forms attracted the Celestials, who collected and stored their essences. In Wundagore, Count Tagar sought his creator and eventually located him at the heart of the Black Galaxy, a living Bio-Verse. With help from Thor, Tagar saw High Evolutionary and Hercules freed, and High Evolutionary chose to focus on pure research, tired of an unproductiveness of conflict. High Evolutionary built a world ship (New Wundagore) at the fringes of the Black Galaxy, adapted his Isotope C (now Isotope C2) and created three New Immortals (Nobilus, Juvan, Zon) partially based on Thor's genetic material. When the Black Galaxy began to \"hatch\" into a new Celestial, High Evolutionary bonded himself with a Rigellian Recorder to absorb more knowledge, evolving the Recorder into a more capable Analyzer. The data absorbed from the Celestial's creation was too much to comprehend, driving High Evolutionary insane. The New Immortals (with New Man Count Tagar, who had subjected himself to Isotope C2) seized control of High Evolutionary's world-ship, though Nobilus and several faithful New Men fled with High Evolutionary. The Man-Beast used this to seek revenge, freeing twelve mutated souls from Counter-Earth (shortly before its apparent accidental destruction at Thanos' hands) and setting them after High Evolutionary, but Warlock intervened to save Wyndham. His mind gradually returned, but Wyndham realized he had lost control of his own revolution and was randomly moving, both mentally and physically, both directions along the evolutionary line. He began developing Isotope E to control his genetic shift. Isotope E had short-lived effects, and he could not develop a permanent \"cure\". When the Recorder/Analyzer warned Wyndham that the New Immortals were creating an Earth-threatening weapon, High Evolutionary returned to Wundagore Mountain on Earth and built forces to oppose. He created newer and more powerful New Men, as well as the Godpack, effectively New Immortals created by treating humans rather than creating them anew. He created the White Tiger during this time, designed and to hunt out and destroy the Man-Beast. He allowed the Godpack and New Men to fight to further their abilities, and when the Godpack proved superior, he abandoned his New Men. The Man-Beast (calling himself Karnivore) took control of them and attacked Wundagore. The Man-Beast was driven off, and High Evolutionary apologetically reclaimed his New Men. High Evolutionary, with Thor, the Godpack, and his New Men, traveled to the New Wundagore worldship and defeated the New Immortals, despite betrayal by one of the Godpack. The New Immortals were placed in suspended animation, the Godpack sent to live in New York City, and High Evolutionary returned to Wundagore Mountain with his New Men. During this time, the mutant Exodus and his Acolytes had captured High Evolutionary near Wundagore. Learning of Isotope E, they assaulted Wundagore and drove High Evolutionary and his New Men out. Leaving the New Men in the custody of Quicksilver, High Evolutionary retreated to his Savage Land fortress, there continuing work on Isotope E. When Ka-Zar shut down the Land-maintaining terraformers, their energies redirected through Ka-Zar's wife Shanna. High Evolutionary saw in Shanna a potential cure, and became infatuated with her sharing of his evolutionary talents. Ultimately, Shanna rejected him; High Evolutionary restored the terraformers and retreated to his fortress again. The Acolytes soon located and attacked him there and High Evolutionary, Quicksilver, and the New Men returned to Wundagore. However, the Man-Beast had been masquerading as one of High Evolutionary's New Men, and assaulted High Evolutionary, leaving him nearly comatose. While the New Men, Acolytes, Man-Beast and the Heroes for Hire (brought by the White Tiger, hunting the Man-Beast) all battled in Wundagore, High Evolutionary jumped to the high end of the evolutionary spectrum, insanely driving himself towards purging the world's life to end the chaos around him. The New Man Lord Delphis finalized a permanent cure from Isotope E; both Man-Beast and the White Tiger were devolved to animal forms, the Acolytes' leader Exodus was left comatose and placed in a seal chamber below Wundagore, and the Black Knight remained in Wundagore to train a new generation of Knights of Wundagore. An aged Dr. Nathaniel Essex, who had inspired Wyndham decades before, recently sought out his old pupil and convinced him to remove the advanced mutations that had created super-powered mutants; Wyndham did so from a shielded space station. However, Essex was secretly the diabolical Mr. Sinister and betrayed High Evolutionary, turning the experiment to the rampant mutation of all life on Earth. The X-Men, despite being powerless, intervened and stopped Essex, and High Evolutionary voluntarily destroyed the equipment, restoring Earth to its prior form.A returning Adam Warlock has recently found the High Evolutionary hoping to get help against the Phalanx and Ultron.",

      "biography": "Carlton LaFroyge was a classmate and neighbor of Robbie Baldwin, the secret identity of Speedball and member of the New Warriors. When LaFroyge happened to witness Baldwin's transformation into Speedball before embarking on a mission, LaFroyge seized on a plan to allow him to participate in the world of super-heroes as he had always dreamed of. He blackmailed Speedball into allowing him to join the New Warriors. When confronted with the fact that he has no superhuman powers, LaFroyge designed a makeshift costume and called himself Hindsight Lad, professing his ability to discern tactical strategy after the fact. Speedball and the Warriors reluctantly agreed to give LaFroyge access to their headquarters, the Crash Pad, although he was regulated to only computer duty and other administrative work.Despite his often patronizing teammates, LaFroyge reveled in his new role. At one point, he was instrumental in organizing a surrogate team of Warriors to rescue the regular team, which was trapped in the past by the Sphinx. In gratititude, the New Warriors allowed LaFroyge to be considered a full-time member, albeit still restricted from field work. Soon after, LaFroyge redesigned his costume and changed his code name to Hindsight. Eventually, when the Warriors began to drift apart, the team effectively disbanded, and LaFroyge left to pursue college.When the New Warriors re-formed as the basis of a reality TV show, their antics resulted in disaster-- an accident that claimed the lives of many of their number as well as hundreds of innocent civilians, many of them school children. Tremendous public outrage resulted, and former New Warriors were being attacked in their civilian identities. Justice and Rage sought legal help from Jennifer Walters, She-Hulk, in shutting down DestroyAllWarriors.com, a website devoted to Warrior-hate and that revealed the Warrior's true identities. The resulting lawsuit very nearly argued the legality of the Superhuman Registration Act itself, but She-Hulk and the former Warriors dropped the suit when Iron Man, fresh from being a witness for the defense, gave the heroes a lead to the true culprit-- Carlton LaFroyge. Hindsight, so distraught by the tragedy and shamed of his association with the Warriors, was personally behind DestroyAllWarriors.com.",

      "biography": "As a Japanese macaque (Macaca fuscata, also known as the snow monkey), Hit-Monkey is proportionally stronger and faster than a human being, though he is not super powered. Like other macaques, he is adapted for cold weather, is an excellent swimmer, possesses advanced pedal dexterity enabling him to use his feet like hands and has an olfactory sense far greater than that of humans. He is smarter than the average macaque, understanding concepts of murder and revenge, and is able to copy fighting styles and firearms usage after observing them. He is one of the world’s best paw-to-hand fighters and is skilled with a variety of weaponry. His signature style is a combination of Eastern martial arts and monkey agility, recognizable to experienced assassins. He is also trained in survival and the use of medicinal herbs native to northern Japan. Hit-Monkey has natural animal magnetism, making human females want to hang out with him. He has a 3” non-prehensile tail.\n\nHistory\n\nA clan of macaque monkeys lived peacefully near volcanic hot springs in the mountains of northern Japan until the day they discovered an unconscious business-suit wearing assassin with a bag of weapons and money on the run from an unrevealed army. The monkeys took in the assassin and cared for him using the traditional healing herbs of their society, but one young male was threatened by the outsider and seemed to understand the blood on the man’s hands was a warning of the capacity for violence in humans. He begrudgingly watched the clan accept the man and studied him practicing martial arts, copying the moves when no one was looking. When the human’s health deteriorated, the dissenting macaque demanded they let the outsider die. He was exiled when he used martial arts against his clan to settle the disagreement. Two days later, he saw gun-toting humans approaching the mountain and returned to find the assassin surrounded by soldiers and the clan hidden in rock crevices. The assassin was gunned down, as were the rest of the clan when they moved to retaliate. The exiled survivor took the assassin’s guns and shot back. Using his innate skills, the martial arts he copied from the human and the bag full of weapons, he took revenge. That was the day the legend of Hit-Monkey was born. Hit-Monkey’s reputation grew and he became something of a bogeyman among assassins: a hitman who hits hitmen. He was known for clean, efficient kills and a keen sense of style.\n\nHit-Monkey gained Spider-Man (Peter Parker)’s attention after hitting an illegal gambling ring and killing Mr. Cheng, a grocer once saved by the wall-crawler. Hit-Monkey spent the next night relaxing at a Manhattan night club with several lady friends while Spider-Man and Deadpool (“Wade Wilson”) investigated the murder scene and deduced Deadpool would be on Hit-Monkey’s hit list. Next, Hit-Monkey executed two corrupt members of the New York City Police Department. The following day he trailed Spider-Man to Deadpool’s location. Despite the mercenary’s disguise (a lady’s dress), Hit-Monkey recognized and attacked his target, wounding Spider-Man in the process. Spider-Man and Deadpool eluded capture temporarily, and when Hit-Monkey found them again he saw in Spider-Man the potential for good, and decided to stop fighting. Deadpool, determined to kill his assailant, attacked the unarmed Hit-Monkey, only to be surprised when the simian assassin fired guns with his feet, seemingly killing Deadpool. Upon healing, Deadpool faked Spider-Man’s death to draw a remorseful Hit-Monkey out and “arrest” him; a battle ensued and Hit-Monkey was apparently killed when his damaged gun exploded, but no body was found.",

      "biography": "Jason Macendale worked for the CIA and was dismissed when his methods were getting too extreme. He decided to use his skills for profit as a mercenary, later adopting the costumed identity of the Jack O'Lantern adorned with a flaming pumpkin for a head, green body armor, and a bouncing pogo platform for transportation. His first target as Jack was to take control of a prototype super-embassy and people in it. He took over the building fast by infiltrating it in the middle of a Halloween party. His bad luck was that Machine Man was among the guests and he quickly foiled Jack's plans. Jack was taken to a hospital and seemed to be in coma. In reality he had taken a drug after he lost to Machine Man that made him fall in the coma, so he would be taken to a hospital rather than a prison. He quickly took the hospital over with his henchmen. When Spider-Man learned about this. He immediately headed to the hospital. He soon found Jack and after a short fight. Jack O'Lantern realized that he wasn't any match for Spider-Man and decided to escape. Spider-Man stopped him in the hospital's yard, knocking him out with a single punch.\nHe tangled up with Spider-Man some time later and was again beaten, but this time was able to escape. After Spider-Man had gone missing Jack O'Lantern stumbled into Silver Sable, and after a short fight she managed to destroy Macendale's pumpkin helmet forcing Macendale to retreat. Macendale then went to free Flash Thompson from jail as he thought that he was the real Hobgoblin. When Hobgoblin heard about this he went to find Jack. He crashed in Jack's hideout and attacked him blaming him for ruining his plan. The fight ended in a stalemate and both villains went their separate ways. Flash managed to escape when Jack and Hobgoblin were fighting.These two later joined with the Kingpin to fight against Hammerhead and his troops. Jack and Hobgoblin, now allies were sent to fight against Hammerhead's troops, but their alliance didn't last long when they had a run-in with Spider-Man. Jack bailed out of the fight and left Hobgoblin to fight him alone. When Kingpin returned he fired Jack O'Lantern explaining that he \"didn't meet his standards.\" Hobgoblin hunted down Jack O'Lantern for revenge for his betrayal, but because of outside interference, the conflict ceased and Hobgoblin took off.Not long after last encounter with the Hobgoblin, Macendale hired the Foreigner to kill him. Foreigner pulled some strings and got hitmen to kill Ned Leeds. Macendale then acquired Hobgoblin's equipment and paid a visit to Rose and Kingpin. He then attacked Spidey again and managed to give Spider-Man a hard landing. He was just about to finish him off with a pumpkin bomb when Flash Thompson intervened. He caught the bomb and threw it back at Hobgoblin. It exploded and Hobgoblin ended up with broken rips and retreated. In the beginning of the Inferno incident Hobgoblin went after Harry Osborn. He wanted Osborn to tell him where the Green Goblin formula was located, threatening Osborn's family. Osborn gave Macendale false information, and later, as the Green Goblin, pursued him. Osborn, aided by Spider-Man, battled the Hobgoblin. Harry triumphed and pinned Macendale between a wall and himself, admitting to Macendale that the Goblin formula was destroyed years ago. The Hobgoblin managed to escape but didn't get far before he was attacked by a horde of demons. He decided to find the leader of the demons N'astirh to ask him to give him power. Macendale offered his soul to him. Amused, N'astirh rejected the offer but nonetheless gave him superhuman powers through the infusion of a demonic entity within Macendale's body. After, the demonic Hobgoblin engaged Spider-Man in combat within the sewers, but Spider-Man was victorious.Next time he surfaced he was hired to kill Doctor Strange. They fought for sometime and Strange managed to trick Macendale into thinking that he had lost his powers, so he flew away. The next job to Hobgoblin was given by Hammerhead to kill Joe Robertson. Hobgoblin attacked Robertson at his home but didn't count on Puma being there and Spider-Man soon joined the fight. With a little help from Tombstone they managed to drive Hobgoblin away. He then decided to release Carrion from prison and attacked the prison transport that was transporting him. He freed him and convinced him to ally with himself against Spider-Man. Carrion and Hobgoblin succeeded in capturing Spider-Man, but Spider-Man eventually escaped. Carrion then sacrificed himself to save his mother by taking Hobgoblin and himself out with one of Hobgoblin's pumpkin bombs.Hobgoblin survived the explosion and was approached by Doctor Octopus to join his Sinister Six. He fought against Doctor Octopus and was impressed of his skill. He then agreed to join the group, but Doctor Octopus betrayed them all later and the other members ganged up against Doc Ock, but they weren't a mach for him. Hobgoblin had encounters with Ghost Rider, Darkhawk, Hulk, Deathlok, Nova, Solo, Sleepwalker and Fantastic Four who took him and rest of Sinister Six down. Soon after that the demonic side of Hobgoblin broke free of Macendale as a separate entity. The Hobgoblin and this new Demogoblin attacked Spider-Man again and eventually lost. Spider-Man managed to capture Hobgoblin with Venom and Ghost Rider. Macendale later acquired a modified version of  Kraven's strength-enhancing formula and then killed Demogoblin. He also fought Green Goblin (Phil Urich), Thing, Kaine and Scarlet Spider before he altered his body with cybernetic enhancements from Gaunt. He then framed Ben Reilly for torching his workplace, the Daily Grind. Spider-Man (Ben Reilly) captured Hobgoblin and turned him in. He was then put on trial for a series of crimes he committed as the Hobgoblin. During that trial it was revealed that Ned Leeds was the Hobgoblin before Jason Macendale. Soon after the original Hobgoblin (Roderick Kingsley) broke in Macendale's jail cell and killed him, declaring himself the only Hobgoblin who deserved the title.",

      "biography": "Roderick Kingsley was a successful fashion designer and millionaire who had built his empire through underworld ties and unethical practices. One of his criminal associates, George Hill, had stumbled upon one of the secret lairs of the original Green Goblin. He relayed this information to Kingsley, who killed him to ensure the secret would remain hidden. Reading through Norman Osborn's journals and examining the various \"goblin\" paraphernalia and weaponry, Kingsley found himself enthralled with the idea of becoming a costumed criminal. Therefore he forged a new identity, with an altered costume as the Hobgoblin.Using information he acquired from journals left behind by Norman Osborn, Kingsley intended to blackmail several key figures including J.Jonah Jameson and Osborn's son Harry. Inevitably, this drew him into conflict with Spider-Man, who Kingsley saw as only a nuisance and had only planned to deal with him in afterthought. After being beaten soundly by the web-slinger several times, Kingsley became obsessed with reproducing Osborn's original strength enhancing formula so he could deal with Spider-Man more effectively. Not wanting to suffer the insanity that plagued Norman Osborn as a result of exposure to formula, Kingsley decided to test it on a small time thug named Arnold \"Lefty\" Donovan. After exposing him to the formula, Kingsley had Donovan attack Spider-Man in the guise of the Hobgoblin. Kingsley monitored Donovan's vitals from afar, checking for anomalies. Spider-man defeated Donovan and unmasked him, but before he could compromise Kingsley's identity, he remote-controlled the goblin glider to crash, killing him.\nConvinced that the test was a success, Kingsley immersed himself in the new formula and emerged with strength that surpassed even the original Green Goblin's. Sometime later Kingsley discovered that the reporter Ned Leeds had followed him to his lair and learned of his secret identity. Through hypnosis, Kingsley was able to brainwash Leeds into becoming a new Hobgoblin that Kingsley could manipulate from the shadows, particularly as a stand-in during negotiations with The Rose (Richard Fisk) in an elaborate plot to bring the Kingpin's empire down. To further protect his identity and deflect the attention of his enemies, Kingsley at one point framed Flash Thompson as the Hobgoblin. Thompson was arrested, only to be freed by Jack O' Lantern (Jason Philip Macendale). Macendale learned that Thompson was not the real Hobgoblin, which infuriated him. Thompson was subsequently exonerated. Eventually, Hobgoblin and the Rose had a falling out, with the latter enlisting the Jack O'Lantern to dispatch the former. Hobgoblin defeated him, forcing Macendale to pursue an alternative method of destroying his enemy. As Kingsley had gone to great pains to convince everyone that Ned Leeds was the real Hobgoblin, it was Leeds that ultimately paid the price. Macendale had the mercenary called the Foreigner arrange an assassination of Leeds in his hotel room while on assignment overseas with Peter Parker. Kingpin then told Parker's alter-ego, Spider-Man that Leeds was the Hobgoblin, illustrating this fact with photos of the assassination, showing Leeds in full Hobgoblin costume. Kingsley, satisfied that his identity had been protected and that the underworld believed the Hobgoblin dead, retired to Belize.Macendale then took the opportunity to take up the mantle of what was then thought to be the \"deceased\" Hobgoblin. After his tenure as the Hobgoblin, and corruption into a demonic form (resulting in the emergence of the Demogoblin), Macendale was ultimately arrested. During his trial Macendale publicly revealed that Ned Leeds was the \"original\" Hobgoblin - even though no one, including Macendale, at that point knew that was not true at all. \nThe true Hobgoblin, Kingsley returned from retirement, his first act being to kill Macendale whom he deemed unworthy of his title. He then kidnapped Betty Brant as part of a trap for Spider-Man. However, during the battle, Kingsley's brother Daniel was captured and Kingsley was unmasked. Finally, the true and original Hobgoblin was revealed and Ned Leeds' name was cleared. When Norman Osborn was revealed to be alive and well, the imprisoned Kingsley became furious at Osborn's denial of being the Green Goblin. He claimed the existence of a lost journal of Osborn's that proved that he was indeed the Green Goblin. Osborn had Kingsley broken out of prison and provided him with new Hobgoblin equipment while a mysterious new Green Goblin (a genetic construct created by Osborn) kidnapped Daniel Kingsley, the only person who supposedly knew where the last journal was. After capturing both Daniel and Spider-Man, the two Goblins returned to Osborn who revealed the truth – that he knew there was no other journal and he had bought Kingsley's empire out from under him. Infuriated, Hobgoblin attacked and a climatic battle between both Goblins and Osborn ensued. Spider-Man was able to take Daniel to safety as the entire building began to collapse and burn down. All three villains escaped, and although Osborn believed himself to be victorious, Kingsley had safely stowed away several millions of dollars in various overseas accounts. He then quietly retired to the Caribbean.",

      "biography": "Holocaust first appeared at the X-Men's base at Wundagore Mountain. He was sent there by Apocalypse in order to prove his worth. Known as Nemesis as the time, he claimed to be the son of Apocalypse. Nemesis was sent to kill as many of Magneto's young students as he could while the X-Men were off fighting Apocalypse's Horsemen. He was defeated in battle by the Scarlet Witch, although he was able to kill her. He left before the X-Men returned and was embraced by Apocalypse as his newest Horseman. During Apocalypse's blitzkrieg launched against Europe and Asia, Nemesis joined Apocalypse in Japan. They murdered thousands of humans and captured Sunfire, but before they could kill him, Sunfire unleashed a nuclear level plasma blast. Nemesis absorbed the blast, saving himself and Apocalypse. When Apocalypse returned home to recuperate, Nemesis, now charged with Sunfire's energies, was left to take care of Japan. A small squad of X-Men attacked him. Using Sunfire's energy, Nemesis was about to murder Quicksilver. Enraged, Magneto used his powers to tear Nemesis apart from the inside out. The X-Men retreated, many of them injured, and left the burnt corpse of Nemesis for dead.Nemesis awoke in the labs of the Dark Beast and was fitted with a transparent armor that would not only channel his energy but also contain him and keep him from dissipating. He took the name Holocaust and would eventually become a Horseman again.In the days leading up to the fall of Apocalypse, Holocaust faced off against Sabretooth and Wild Child in Chicago. Holocaust was winning and, in his excitement, revealed the secret location of an Infinite processing plant. Wild Child took this information back to the X-Men who used it to save thousands of lives. Defeated in Indianapolis by the X-Men, the beaten Holocaust returned to his father's side. In the final battle of the Age of Apocalypse, Holocaust fought the Sinister-created Nate Grey. Grey stabbed Holocaust with a shard of the M'Kraan Crystal, which sent both of them into the original Marvel Universe (616), where Holocaust continued to wreak havoc. Eventually Holocaust was placed onto the Exiles when they visited the Age of Apocalypse world. Immediately attacking his team members, Holocaust decided to escape the battle to seek out the M'Kraan Crystal. After finding the crystal in a military base, Holocaust interogated the research staff who told them there was another object making similar energy emissions as the crystal. The technicians equipment led Holocaust back to the Exiles and the Tallus. Using the Tallus and the M'Kraan Crystal, Holocaust and the Exiles teleported to the Panoptichron where they encountered Hyperion. Discovering Hyperion was behind his becoming an Exile, Holocaust attacked Hyperion. Hyperion quickly delt with Holocaust by cracking open his shell and \"eating\" the pure energy that he was made of effectively killing Holocaust.",

      "biography": "Known across the world as the Mutant Messiah, Hope Summers is born after M-Day as the only new mutant. Though unlike other mutants, her mutant gene is detectable at birth, making her a highly sought-after target by many groups with good but mostly ill intentions. But it’s Cable that finds and protects her. They go on the run through the timestream evading the time-traveling Bishop, who intends to slay her for destroying his Earth, and in the meantime, Hope learns warfare tactics and how to defend herself. When her mutant powers manifest, she can imitate the powers of any mutant or super human around her. She learns how to use her powers and eventually joins several mutant-protecting groups, including the X-Men and X-Force.\n\nMUTANT MESSIAH\n\n\nBorn to Captain Louise Spalding, an intelligent, free-spirited firefighter, the baby that would later be named Hope is the first mutant born since “M-Day,” when an insane Wanda Maximoff, AKA Scarlet Witch, stripped the majority of mutants of their abilities. Psi-sensitive mutants, including members of the heroic X-Men, sense the baby’s mutant potential. Additionally, her mutant nature is so powerful that her very existence takes the X-Men’s mutant-detecting computer Cerebra completely off-line. The anti-mutant religious zealot group the Purifiers also detected her birth using their mutant-detecting technology. The Purifiers attack the Cooperstown, Alaska, hospital where the baby is born, slaughtering 266 townspeople and babies (including Louise) to slay the baby. Desiring the baby for his power schemes, mad geneticist Nathaniel Essex, AKA Mister Sinister, sends his Marauders assassination squad to Cooperstown to obtain her, and they conflict with the Purifiers. Neither faction finds the baby thanks to the X-Man Nathan Summers, AKA Cable, and Wade Wilson, AKA Deadpool, who secretly whisk her off to safety. Believing her to be a mutant “messiah” that would eventually save all of mutantkind, Cable takes the baby on the run to keep her safe from all the forces hunting her.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLearning his son Cable had the baby and believing he had turned traitor, X-Men leader Scott Summers, AKA Cyclops, sends a strike team called X-Force to hunt Cable and procure the baby by any means necessary. X-Force locates Cable in Alberta, Canada, where he protected the baby from a Purifiers assault. Cable flees to Dallas, where he hopes to obtain, from mutant inventor Forge, the parts needed to operate time travel equipment. There, fellow X-Man Bishop, AKA Bishop, who believed the baby would somehow kill a million humans, bringing about his dystopian future (Earth-1191), attacks Cable. But the Marauders attack Bishop and takes the baby to Sinister. However, Sinister’s ally Raven Darkholme, AKA Mystique, attacks him and takes the baby. Hoping to cure her comatose foster daughter, the X-Man Anna Marie, AKA Rogue, whose touch had become lethal, Mystique presses the baby against Rogue. This act somehow cures Rogue while the baby remains unharmed by Rogue’s power absorption ability. Taking Hope from Mystique, X-Men founder Charles Xavier, AKA Professor X, gives her back to Cable and asks him to take her into the timestream for safekeeping. Before he could, however, a massive battle erupts between the Marauders, a mutant-devouring Predator X, and the X-Men, which ends with the Marauders’ defeat. At the exact moment Cable disappears into the timestream with the baby (at Cyclops’ orders), Bishop tries to kill her again.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPSYCHIC POWER DUPLICATION\n\n\nHope is an omega-level mutant that can psychically duplicate any superhuman power-signatures nearby at their utmost capacity, also known as a Pluripotent Echopraxic. However, she generates power levels that are potentially dangerous to people and the environment around her. Her full power catalog is unrevealed, but Hope can mimic telekinesis, psychic armor, optic blasts, the ability to emit immensely powerful force bolts from her hands, organic metal transformation, ice generation, seismic-wave manipulation, and “jump-starting” neophyte mutant development. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe firebird manifestation associated with the Phoenix Force appears in Hope’s eyes as early as five months old. In her teens, it fully manifests around her, suggesting Hope has a connection to the primal cosmic power. After her initial detection at birth, Hope somehow becomes undetectable by mutant-detecting equipment. While an infant, inadvertently drained a massive excess of psychic energy from Rogue, apparently without side effects from Rogue’s psychic draining. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nCable trains Hope in CPR, combat first aid, warfare strategy, survival tactics, and the use of a wide array of bladed and ballistic weaponry, hand-to-hand combat, and some gymnastics.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nENEMIES FROM DAY ONE\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter “M-Day” when Scarlet Witch magically removed all mutants’ abilities, the first to have powers is an unborn baby. When Hope grows in the womb of her mother, psi-sensitive mutants and mutant-detecting technology across the world detect her mutant potential. As such, the anti-mutant group the Purifiers and Mister Sinister’s Marauders target Hope. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nFellow X-Man Bishop believes Hope is responsible for his dystopian future on Earth-1191, and follows her and her adoptive father Cable through the timestream to kill her. Hope and Cable survive many battles and escape Bishop numerous times, and finally Cable banishes him to the year 6700 AD.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nShe remains a target of evil groups and the Avengers, who either seek to control her or prevent her powers from harming others, respectively. Though when Scarlet Witch helps her undo the spell that made Hope the Mutant Messiah in the first place, she is no longer a target.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFAMILY TIES AND MUTANT ALLIES\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter her mother Louise Spalding is killed, the messiah baby is raised by her foster father, Cable who believes she is destined to save both mutant and humankind. Cable, a harsh military-type father figure, teaches Hope warfare strategy and survival techniques. Cable’s partner and wife Hope Summers of Earth-80521 raises the baby with him up until her death, marking the moment Cable names the baby Hope Summers in honor of her foster mother.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt five months old, baby Hope displays a connection to the Phoenix Force, visible in her eyes and eventually around her body. It leaves her to possess five other mutants so that it can remake the world. After it possesses Cyclops and he becomes the Dark Phoenix, Hope with help from Scarlet Witch, accepts it back into herself and removes the Dark Phoenix from the force, and becomes the White Phoenix temporarily.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nShe has an on- and off-again relationship with the X-Men, becomes the leader of the reformed X-Force, joins the Mutant Liberation Front to protect mutants, and later joins The Five–a group of resurrectionist mutants on Krakoa. With Joshua Foley, AKA Elixir, Fabio Medina, AKA Goldballs, Kevin MacTaggert, AKA Proteus, Eva Bell, AKA Tempus&nbsp;, and Xavier’s help, they bring back mutants from the dead into cloned bodies by combining all their powers.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA DOOMED BUT HOPEFUL HISTORY\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCable and the baby arrived in the year 2043 AD of the alternate future of Earth-80251 and soon learned that Bishop had escaped capture by the X-Men, stolen a time machine from Forge, and followed them into the timestream, still intent on killing the baby. Tracking Cable, Bishop confronted him there five months later in the first of many battles over the baby, which left Cable’s time travel mechanism only able to go forward in time. Cable and the baby were taken in by a Good Samaritan, Sophie Pettit. With Pettit’s help, Cable located a cache of weapons and supplies stored in the remains of the Xavier Institute and used them to confront Bishop in New York City; Cable fled into the timestream when Bishop gained the upper hand in the battle.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAdvancing 85 years into the future, Cable recalled the legend of New Liberty, a secret city hidden and protected behind force fields. Cable met and eventually married a New Liberty woman named Hope who teased Cable about only calling the unnamed baby “Little Girl”; Hope called her “Little Momma” instead. Two years later, the baby was now a very strong-willed little girl, often challenging Cable when he gave her directions. When the United States Army found and invaded New Liberty, Cable learned that humans in the outside world had mixed their DNA with that of cockroaches, becoming monstrous bug-men. Lured into position by Cable, “Little Girl” pressed the button that set off explosives that killed the cockroach army, her first act of war. Fleeing New Liberty, Cable learned the world outside of New Liberty had been devastated by Bishop’s weapons of mass destruction, who was now desperate to narrow the area where Cable and the child could flee. When approaching a settlement to find shelter, Cable, weak and weary from lack of sleep and food, reacted slowly to the settlement’s defenders, while gunfire killed his wife. Both devastated by her death, Cable and “Little Girl” ventured farther inland. In honor of her dead foster mother, Cable finally named the child Hope.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDuring two years serving in a rebel faction against the cockroach army, Cable began teaching Hope warfare strategy and survival techniques, becoming a harsh drill sergeant-figure to her. Cable and Hope went 1000 years into the future to avoid the rebel faction’s rash detonation of biological weapons to destroy the cockroaches, finding their actions had destroyed all life. At seven years old, Hope began asking questions about her life, gradually learning of her past, and of mutantkind; Hope became excited to discover what her mutant abilities were. The two made their way to what used to be Westchester, New York, where Cable hoped to find supplies hidden in the ruins of the Xavier estate. During this leg of the journey, Cable tried to learn what Hope’s mutant abilities were, which frustrated Hope, who didn’t know if she even had any. After finding supplies and clothes at Xavier’s, the two went to 2973 AD, where they reunited with Earth-616’s X-Force, sent by Cyclops to find and assist them. X-Force and Cable struck an uneasy alliance with the eternal despot Apocalypse and a centuries-old Deadpool-80521. They fought a desperate war against Bishop and Cable’s clone, the dictator Stryfe, ultimately defeating them. Upset at parting ways with X-Force and harboring a growing resentment for Cable’s harsh rearing, Hope threw a temper tantrum as they entered the timestream, separating the two by two years. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAlone for the first time in her life, Hope’s training kicked in, and she made her way to a nearby city of surviving humans to wait for Cable to find her. While there, she met a young boy named Emil Spence, who helped feed and hide Hope. Despite initially resisting him, Hope eventually befriended him, then fell in love with him. However, Bishop tracked Hope to the city and befriended Emil’s father, the commander of the city’s police force, manipulating the force to help find Hope, not mentioning he would set off a nuclear device to destroy her upon sight. For two years, Emil and Hope eluded Bishop and Emil’s father, but when Cable eventually found Hope, he forced her onto a departing spaceship, leaving Emil behind. However, two years later, Emil, his father, and Bishop used another starship to find Cable. Before Bishop could detonate his nuclear device, the parasitic Brood race attacked, seeking new hosts. During the resulting battle, Emil put Hope and Cable into the only remaining escape pods, then detonated Bishop’s nuclear device to destroy the Brood. However, Bishop survived as a prisoner of the surviving Brood.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow 17 years old, Hope returned with Cable to Earth, where Hope decided she was ready to return to her native time and the X-Men. Before Cable could enact a plan, they were attacked by Bishop again. During the battle, Hope’s powers emerged, and Hope easily defeated Bishop. Stealing technology from Bishop’s bionic arm, Cable repaired his time travel device and leapt into the past. But the time machine’s make-shift repairs made time travel difficult and tethered Bishop to their jumps. A dogged pursuit across multiple pasts and futures followed. Eventually, Cable used Bishop’s time travel device to banish Bishop to the year 6700 AD. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nUpon arriving at the X-Mansion in 1990 and finally acknowledging the father-daughter bond they shared, Cable and Hope jumped to the present era. Both the X-Men&nbsp;and the anti-mutant Human Council, led by the mutant-hunting Bastion, detected Cable’s arrival. Assuming Hope was with Cable, both organizations sent troops to locate her, resulting in an intense war causing numerous fatalities for the X-Men. Running from the battles, Hope was exposed to civilized society for the first time, all of which made her secretly long for normalcy. After Hope finally reached the X-Men’s artificial island sanctuary, Utopia, Bastion entrapped them with his impenetrable energy dome. He assaulted them with dozens of Nimrod Sentinels, brought from a dystopian Sentinel-ruled “Days of Future Past” reality (Earth-811 or a variant) in which Sentinels exterminated all mutants. While the X-Men battled the Nimrods, Cable and X-Force traveled to the Nimrods’ future, and ultimately destroyed the Sentinel processing plants. Cable sacrificed himself to his techno-organic virus infection to briefly maintain the time portal for X-Force’s return, apparently dying when it closed. Enraged at the defeat of his Sentinels, Bastion directly attacked but was destroyed by Hope, whose fury over Cable’s death caused her powers to manifest fully. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nHope has since journeyed to Alaska to discover her roots, learning the identity of her mother, and meeting her grandmother. Afterward, while investigating an apparent new mutant manifestation, Hope somehow jump-started the mutant’s development, and in doing so, believed she found her life’s purpose. She sought out other mutant manifestations and found others whose X-genes activated, all of which were the first mutants to emerge, other than Hope, since “M-Day”. With Cyclops’ approval, these new mutants became known as the Lights and trained as a mutant-emergence rescue team. These mutants included Laurie Tromette, AKA Transonic, Gabriel Cohuelo, AKA Velocidad, Idie Okonkwo, AKA Oya, Teon Macik, AKA Primal, and Kenji Uedo, AKA Zero. When Hope met Kenji, she experienced exhaustion after mimicking his powers but stabilized them and personality as well. After Teon’s issue of guardianship went to a trail, Kenji and Laurie talked about how all the Lights were drawn to Hope but didn’t understand it fully. When one of the Lights committed suicide over being bullied, Kenji tried to exact revenge but Logan/James Howlett, AKA Wolverine stopped him. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen Crimson Commando ambushed Hope and Laurie while shopping and kidnapped Hope, Wolverine rescued her. Hope confronted him about how he acted towards her, and he revealed his fear that he would one day have to kill her. Afterward, Hope joined Cyclops against Kuurth and had to combine her power with the rest of the X-Men to defeat Kuurth, but it was Piotr Rasputin, AKA Colossus, now with the power of the Juggernaut, who ultimately drove him off.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen the Hellfire Club attacked the X-Men on Utopia, Cyclops ordered Oya to slay them all. Shortly after that, a super Sentinel attacked, nearly destroying the island, and these events created a schism between the X-Men, particularly Wolverine and Cyclops. Hope remained on Utopia with Cyclops and forced Laurie to stay as well, though Laurie fought for Oya to be sent with Wolverine who departed the island with other mutants.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHope developed a relationship with Gabriel, but when she discovered him kissing Megan Gwynn, AKA Pixie, it ended. She then invited Pixie to join the Lights team. She later met Martha Johansson, AKA No-Girl and added her to the ranks, as well as Sebastian Hiram Shaw, AKA Black King, whose mind had been wiped clean of his former misdeeds. Kenji then concluded that Hope had some kind of control over the Lights and needed to be killed as a solution, and put his plan into action but was slain.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhile training with Cyclops, Hope manifested the Phoenix Firebird. Though the Avengers arrived and demanded to take Hope into custody. Hope escaped and later tried to make a deal with Wolverine. She planned to confront the Phoenix Force on the Moon with his help, but Wolverine summoned the Avengers who were followed by the X-Men. The Phoenix Force arrived and split itself into five pieces, entering Cyclops, Emma Frost, Illyana Rasputin, AKA Magik, Namor McKenzie, AKA Namor the Sub-Mariner, and Colossus who became the Phoenix Five, while Hope was knocked unconscious. The Phoenix Five returned to Earth with Hope to remake the world. Hope tried to accept the Phoenix back into her, but Cyclops refused. The Avengers arrived, and Hope volunteered to go with the Scarlet Witch, who took her to K’un-Lun. There, Hope learned she would be trained by Peter Parker, AKA Spider-Man, who shared his uncle’s sage advice that, “With great power comes great responsibility.”&nbsp;Cyclops interrupted, and a battle between him and the Avengers ensued, and Cyclops defeated the dragon, Shou-Lao. Hope mimicked the dragon’s flames and Scarlet Witch’s powers and sent Cyclops to the Moon. Hope argued with Scarlet Witch about having destroyed her life when she changed reality reducing the mutant population. Though Captain America and Iron Man had a plan to defeat Cyclops that required Hope and Wanda to reconcile, or at least cease fighting. Hope and Wanda worked together to hurt Cyclops, and he let go of the Phoenix Force after Jean Grey visited him in the White Hot Room–the realm of the Phoenix–and encouraged him to let go of it. Hope again became its host but removed the flames from the Dark Phoenix, thus becoming White Phoenix. Wanda helped Hope understand her purpose, and together they undid Wanda’s original spell that reduced the mutant race.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHope attended the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning but secretly searched for her adoptive father, Cable, despite receiving a letter from him that advised against it. During her search, she came upon Namor and a sunken Utopia, and when asked about how he dealt with war in the aftermath of destroying Wakanda, his reasons left her angry. She later saw Cable outside her school window, and they said goodbye to each other.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThough she continued to search for him and made a deal with Neena Thurman, AKA Domino, to use her powers of luck to find him. Finding him in Nebraska, she mimicked his telekinesis powers to contact him. She expressed her anger towards him about why he didn’t contact her, but they quickly reconciled. Hope later joined him alongside X-Force to fight against Stryfe and Bastion though X-Force disbanded after the battle. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter Hope became comatose following a disaster in Virginia, Cable reformed X-Force. The team saved another catatonic mutant, MeMe. MeMe had electro-magnetic transference abilities so Hope mimicked her powers and impersonated her unknown to the team. She helped X-Force as a digital interface by hacking computers and gaining intel from them. It wasn’t until telepath Betsy Braddock, AKA Psylocke, realized MeMe was Hope. The truth remained a secret from Cable until Mojo revealed it to him. Cable left the team, and Hope stepped in as the team’s leader.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA band of mercenaries with cybernetic enhancements known as the Revears later captured Hope to turn her into one of them, but a time-displaced Jean Grey tracked her down to learn from her experience with the Phoenix Force. Together, they defeated the Reavers. Hope, with assistance from Rachel Summers, AKA Marvel Girl now going by Prestige, Quentin Quire, AKA Kid Omega, Colossus, and Magik, tried to help Jean understand the Phoenix Force.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHope joined the Mutant Liberation Front with Sean Cassidy, AKA Banshee, to protect other mutants. Though she found herself up against the X-Men and shot Cyclops in his eye. She rejoined the X-Men when the Brotherhood of Mutants posed a threat to them all.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter Xavier established the mutant nation-state of Krakoa, Hope joined a group of resurrectionist mutants to bring back their fallen brethren. Hope used her abilities to amplify the others’ powers within the group, and they successfully brought back once-dead mutants. Revered on Krakoa, they became known as The Five.",

      "biography": "Duckworld, a planet in another dimension where intelligent life evolved from waterfowl, resembles Earth in an astounding number of ways, including the fact that ducks speak English. (In fact, Howard mistook Earth for Duckworld on his arrival, until he saw the “hairless apes” wandering around.) Howard was born the eldest son of Dave and Dottie, but beyond enjoying his rocking horse on Christmas as a baby, he disappointed them in every other way. He couldn’t hold down any job, be it serious or frivolous, and couldn’t fit in to any group. Instead, he figured he had no use for society, despite his ability to adapt to any situation and society, and found content as a malcontent.\n\nHoward found himself trapped in a world that he never made when the power-hungry demon Thog the Nether-Spawn used his magic to shift the interdimensional Cosmic Axis in hopes that all realities could be collapsed into one under his control. Howard was plucked from Duckworld and dropped into the middle of the Florida Everglades on Earth-- the site of this world's Nexus of All Realities. Reluctantly, Howard joined the similarly-dislodged Korrek the Barbarian and Earth’s Jennifer Kale, Dakimh the Enchanter, and the Man-Thing in stopping the forces of Thog. When the battle was over, Howard accidentally fell off the otherdimensional Stepping Stones of Oblivion and landed in the city of Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nIn Cleveland, Howard was almost immediately arrested for believing to be disrupting the peace. (Actually, the culprit was Garko the Man-Frog who had stumbled into an encounter with Howard.) However, the police soon released him, not wanting to face the public ridicule for having booked a duck. Howard then hoped to find a job, perhaps by solving a series of murders, and instead found himself in an encounter with the vampiric Hellcow.\n\nDespondent that he might never get home or even a job, Howard happened upon the castle of the costumed criminal accountant Pro-Rata. He rescued young life model Beverly Switzler, escaping with the timely arrival of Spider-Man. Bev invited Howard to stay with her, and the two even fell in love.\n\nAlthough Howard has attempted to live as normal a life as possible, considering that he is a talking duck on a world of human beings, he has continually run afoul (so to speak) of various unusual menaces, most notably the members of the Band of the Bland and his archnemesis Doctor Bong. However, through cleverness, persistence, and (perhaps most of all) good luck, Howard has always managed to defeat or escape his adversaries.\n\nHoward came to public notoriety when he became a candidate for the United States presidency on a very minor party ticket known as the All-Night Party. However, the general populace refused to believe that Howard is a real talking duck, thinking of him instead as a small person in a duck suit, and the public dismissed his candidacy as a joke.\n\nBev eventually asked that she and Howard separate. Howard, despite his feelings for her, agreed but embarked on a series of wanderings that took him around the country, from Chicago, to New York, and San Francisco. His adventures finally led him back to Cleveland, whereupon he and Bev reunited. After the two reunited Howard faced several different and strange foes such as Ducktor Doom (Larval Earth), Spider-Ham (Larval Earth), Captain Americana, Jackpot, Grey Panther, Kidney Lady, Mister Chicken, Pinball Lizard, and several other creatures and people with fantastic (and sometimes lame) powers.\n\nWhen Howard’s nemesis Doctor Angst attempted to “squish” all realities into a universal state of inertness, Howard was chosen by the cosmic entity called the Critic to join She-Hulk in confronting Doctor Angst and the Band of the Bland, and the universes were restored to their rightful order.\n\nLater, Howard encountered the young mutants Chamber and Skin, who were on the run of the mutant-hunting X-Cutioner. Howard helped them escape and make their way back to their team, Generation X, at the Massachusetts Academy. Howard stayed at the Academy briefly, forming a friendship with the children Artie, Leech, and Franklin Richards. About the same time, the Academy was targeted by the villain Black Tom, and Man-Thing rescued the children, Howard, and an alien refugee Tana Nile. This unlikely band of heroes helped Man-Thing restore balance to the Nexus of All Realities before being returned to the Academy and Howard soon parted company.\n\nWhen a group of heroes was restored to reality after being shunted to Franklin Richards' Counter Earth, the Nexus of Reality was damaged. Howard, because of his experiences passing through the Nexus, he found that a fragment of it became lodged within him. The Cult of Entropy, led by Mahapralaya, hoped to kill Howard in the Man-Thing's swamp and thus destroy the Nexus, Howard was rescued by the Man-Thing and Ellen Brandt. The Man-Thing merged with the Nexus fragment by pouring itself down Howard's throat and being regurgitated. Mahapralaya and the cultists were forced to flee, and Howard left for Cleveland.\n\nMore recently, Bev found a new job at a dot com company, only to find it was run by, Doctor Bong and was captured. Howard rescued Bev, and in the process he was thrown into a vat of chemicals that transformed him into a humanoid rat. While seeking his revenge, Dr Bong destroyed Howard and Bev’s house. They found refuge in the Boarding House of Mystery. However, they were still pursued by Dr. Bong. Finally, by using the magical Amulet of Pazuzu, Howard was able to defeat Dr. Bong. Afterwards, he was asked to go on the Iprah talk show, but Iprah was possessed by the demon-angel hybrid Deuteronomy. Howard destroyed Deuteronomy by using the cigar from the Saint of Therapists, but a puff on that same cigar instantly disintegrated Howard. Now frees from his duck body Howard’s soul passed into the afterlife, and Howard had a conversation with God about the meaning of life. Not long after that conversation God allowed Howard to return to the body of a duck and return to Earth. He was seen recently at the trial of She-Hulk, where he vouched for her not to be erased from history.",

      "biography": "Scientist Bruce Banner’s inner turmoil transforms him into the mean, green rage machine called the Hulk.\n\nThe Monster Inside\n\nThe child of an abusive father, Bruce Banner grew up shy and introverted, yet a scientific genius. As a young man, thanks to his standout work in the field of nuclear physics, he attracted the attention of the U.S. Army who wanted to adapt his theories for weaponry. Banner resisted such notions, but failed attempts at landing steady work convinced him to accept a position at a federal nuclear research facility at a missile base in the New Mexico desert.\n\nAt the base, Banner was befriended by Betty Ross, daughter of General Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross, a man who took an instant disliking to the diminutive, passive scientist. While at the base, Banner began to develop and build a bomb that utilized a high concentration of gamma radiation, a project of high interest to an undercover foreign agent stationed there. When a teenager named Rick Jones wandered onto the test field just as Banner started the countdown for the gamma bomb’s initial test detonation, the scientist rushed out to the area to warn Jones, but the foreign agent purposefully continued the test. The bomb exploded, bathing Bruce Banner in its radiation.\n\nIncredibly, he survived the detonation, but later in the evening transformed into a large, grey, man-like monstrosity dubbed a “hulk” by one of the base’s soldiers.",

      "biography": "Robert Bruce Banner was the son of Dr. Brian Banner, an atomic physicist, and his wife, Rebecca. Brian became convinced that his work in radiation had altered his own genes, resulting in what he saw as a hated mutant offspring. Brian Banner drove himself insane with these fears and murdered Rebecca while trying to kill Bruce. Brian was shot by police before he could harm his son.Bruce graduated high school and studied nuclear physics in Navapo, New Mexico, at Desert State University. With mutants exploding onto the worldwide scene, and the belief that radiation might be the cause of this epidemic, Bruce was invited to work for the United States Defense Department at the nuclear research facility at Desert Base, New Mexico. Bruce's main goal was to create a way for the United States to manufacture its own super-army. Banner went to work immediately, but met with little success. With General \"Thunderbolt\" Ross constantly breathing down his neck for results, Bruce took some shortcuts in his research. These shortcuts ended with disastrous consequences. During the preparation for one of his new Gamma Radiation tests, Bruce was dosed with a lethal amount of Gamma rays. These rays, however, did not kill him. Instead, Bruce was transformed into a huge monster. He rampaged across Desert Base and destroyed it completely.Believing the attack to be mutant in nature, Ross ignored his superiors' orders and pursued the monster that would become known as the Hulk with the remaining men of Desert Base for close to a month. As the Hulk, Bruce eventually destroyed Ross' army in San Diego, CA. Following the battle, the Hulk fled into the ocean.Bruce awoke days later in Australia in the care of Aboriginal people who had taken him in. Bruce vaguely remembered his time as the Hulk. At one point, Magneto himself, assuming the Hulk to be a mutant, visited Banner and offered him a chance to join him in his fight against the humans. Banner declined and asked to be left alone. Magneto reluctantly agreed. Banner is happy to remain out of the public eye and fears what would happen if the Hulk was ever released onto the world again.",

      "biography": "Bruce Banner's childhood dream was to be like Captain America, a skinny youth transformed into an athletic hero. Graduating university two years early, he sought to reproduce the lost super-soldier serum, working for the government under S.H.I.E.L.D.'s General Ross. He became head of the Pittsburgh-based Super-Soldier Program, got engaged to Ross' daughter, Betty, and developed a rivalry with fellow scientist Hank Pym. Rumors persisted that he conducted trials on civilians during departmental lean years; he certainly tested formula on himself more than once. The last test transformed Banner into an intellectually limited, instinct-driven, green-skinned behemoth. Dubbed the Hulk and pursued by Ross' troops, Banner rampaged across the country, briefly reverting to human form during an encounter with Spider-Man.\nEventually restored to human form, and testing negative for Hulk cells, Banner returned to work. When new S.H.I.E.L.D. head Nick Fury expanded the Super-Soldier Program, Banner was demoted to Pym's second-in-command . Dumped and belittled by Betty, and jealous of Pym's successful projects, Banner felt increasingly insecure as he failed to make further progress with his serum. The discovery of the original Captain America, alive and well, provided new data but no breakthrough. Overhearing his colleagues mocking him, Banner cracked; he re-injected himself with his Hulk serum, now laced with Captain America's blood. Becoming a more brutal, gray-skinned Hulk, he slew 852 people on a murderous rampage through Manhattan, trying to reach Betty before the Ultimates finally subdued him. Banner was sealed away in special high-security prison quarters beneath the Triskelion and kept partially sedated to prevent another transformation. His connection to the Hulk was concealed from the public. The Hulk intrabodies had now bonded with his DNA, leaving an apparently permanent risk of transformation. Betty reconciled with him, seemingly aroused by his darker side; Banner meanwhile worked on curing himself, to no avail. When the extraterrestrial Chitauri threatened Earth, Banner was deliberately provoked into transforming, and battled against the invaders before Hawkeye recaptured him using a tranquillizer arrow. After Hulk's identity was leaked to the press, a penitent Banner was tried for mass murder and sentenced to death, despite competent defense by Matt Murdock. Banner was sedated and left aboard the decommissioned U.S.S. Constellation to die in a nuclear explosion., A sympathetic Pym reduced Banner's dosage and Bruce awoke, transforming seconds before the explosion. Bruce Banner now wanders a world that thinks him dead, trying to find a way to control the raging monster that dwells within him.",

      "biography": "Teddy spent the first sixteen years of his life raised by a Skrull posing as a human who he believed to be his mother. Not knowing of his true origins he believed that his shape-shifting and super-strengh abilities meant that he was a mutant and he kept them secret.Teddy used his abilities to fit in at school and became best friends with Greg Norris, the class president and captain of the basketball team. It was to Greg that he first revealed his powers and suprisingly enough Greg, instead of being unnerved, saw the advantages of Teddy's gift. Greg and Teddy pulled many cons and pranks by having Teddy change into popular figures such as Johnny Storm, Hulk and Tony Stark. After hearing that the Avengers had disbanded Teddy was shocked, but Greg had an idea and the two went to the wreckage of the Avengers Mansion. Teddy was in awe of the place and respected it, while Greg went to business with the reason he made the trip by gathering up all he could to sell. Teddy argued that it was wrong to steal and urged Greg to stop but he merely pointed out that Teddy steals peoples identities all the time and that no one would believe Teddy over him if Teddy called the cops. At that point Teddy used his shape-shifting to intimidate Greg who then stepped down and left.After Greg left Teddy then met Iron Lad who was gathering teens, by using the Vision's fail-safe programing, to form a group of Young Avengers to fight Kang the Conqueror. Teddy agreed to join him and become Hulkling alongside Iron Lad (Kang), Stature (Cassie Lang), Patriot (Eli Bradley), Kate Bishop and Wiccan (Billy Kaplan) with whom he kindled a close relationship.After the Patriot quit the team the rest tried to talk him into coming back. While doing so Teddy was abducted by the Super-Skrull who claimed that Teddy was a Skrull himself and he had come to take him back. After a battle the group (minus Eli) escaped to Billy's house where they found Teddy's mother waiting, but before anything could be made clear the Super-Skrull broke in with Eli as a hostage demanding that Teddy comes with him. The Super-Skrull then used a device that was supposedly suppose to reveal that Teddy was a Skrull but instead of Teddy turning into a Skrull his mother did. She stated that she was ordered by the Empress to protect Teddy and shot at the Super-Skrull who retaliated by setting her on fire resulting in her death.The Super-Skrull then kidnapped Teddy and revealed that he was actually Dorrek VIII and the son of Anelle, the Skrull Emperor's daughter, and the only heir to the Skrull empire. But the Emperor had ordered the child's death upon learning who his father was so Teddy was sent to earth to be reunited with his father. Before the Super-Skrull could tell Teddy who his father was the other Young Avengers appeared to rescue Teddy, but they were then interrupted when Kree Soilders appeared claiming that Teddy was Kree.\nThe Kree soliders then said that Teddy was the son of Captain Mar-Vell and by law had to join the Kree army, but Teddy refused and a battle broke out. As the Young Avengers made their escape Teddy insisted in taking the Super-Skrull with them. The Young Avengers then found themselves in the middle of another battle as Skrull and Kree Troops both appeared both demanding that Teddy come with them, but they were aided by the New Avengers. The conflict was resolved when the Super-Skrull, posing as Teddy, agreed to a deal in which Teddy (the Super-Skrull) would spend 6 months with the Krees and 6 months with the Skrulls before making a decison on who he would side with. With the help one of the Super-Skrull to trick both races they transformed into each other the Super-Skrull into Teddy and Teddy into the Super-Skrull, the arrangement was still in order when the races left and Teddy revealed himself safe from both races and staying in earth. After all was done Teddy scattered the ashes of his foster mother to the breeze at the Avenger's Mansion. Recently the Young Avengers were apprehended by S.H.I.E.L.D.. Captain America with Falcon helped Teddy and the Young Avengers escape, when they all seemed to have joined the Anti Registration Act.",

      "biography": "Commissioned by Plan Tzu (a.k.a. Yellow Claw) as part of a complicated plan to establish his unwitting successor, FBI agent Jimmy Woo, as a great hero, the robot M-11 was completed in 1954 by an unidentified professor. Concerned at creating a killing machine completely under the control of Plan's Atlas Foundation, and pressured to hand over M-11 before he could complete the programming modifications he wanted, the scientist took the drastic step of having the robot electrocute him, correctly reasoning that somehow part of his displaced life essence would encode itself in its neural net, giving it free will and emotions. After slaying him, M-11 left the lab and walked into the sea, where it lay inert.\nFour years later, Plan Tzu kidnapped President Elsenhower, and as he intended, Woo gathered together a team of \"G-Men\" to rescue him. M-11 had been found by the Atlantean Namora, while she was searching for her missing cousin Namor; she informed Woo of the machine, and he retrieved it. Its teammate Marvel Boy (Robert Grayson) used Uranian know-how to restore it to working order; M-11 worked with the group out of choice and a growing loyalty to Woo, but pretended to be controlled by a voice-activated radio device Woo carried. After a successful first mission, the G-Men worked together for another six months, battling foes such as the mysterious Foundation and the cosmic-ray mutated dog Laika, before instructions came from above to disband. M-11 was covertly retrieved by Plan Tzu, and over the succeeding decades it allowed him to make numerous upgrades to its systems.\nRecently Plan Tzu moved to pass on his mantle to Woo. After Woo was critically injured while investigating Atlas, Plan convinced M-11 to enlist former teammates Gorilla Man, who got them in to the S.H.I.E.L.D. facility where Woo was being treated, and Grayson, whose alien technology restored Woo to health and youth after the trio broke Woo out. Initially unaware Plan Tzu was watching their every move through M-11's eye, Woo reformed the G-Men to discover the truth behind Atlas. M-11 deduced that Namora, long believed dead, was still alive, and led them to her frozen body, which it revived. After realizing Plan had been manipulating them and ordering M-11 to sever his connection to Plan, Woo led the G-Men to confront their opponent. Plan explained his actions, and ceded control of Atlas to Woo. M-11 currently remains with his former teammates as one of Woo's new Agents of Atlas.",

      "biography": "Lighting the Torch\n\nHotheaded teenager Jonathan Storm and his older sister Susan went to live with their aunt after their mother’s death in a car accident and their father’s incarceration for manslaughter. The two met genius scientist Reed Richards and joined him on a secretive space flight to prove Reed’s theories, but all three and their pilot Ben Grimm absorbed powerful cosmic rays while in space and crash-landed back on Earth.\n\nCrawling from the wreckage of the space vehicle, Storm suddenly grew exceedingly hot and watched in great surprise as he spontaneously burst into flames. Incredibly, due to the cosmic ray exposure, he didn’t burn but found he could control the flames across his body and use them in various ways. Together with the other three, who also changed forever from the rays, Storm became a member of the family of explorers and adventurers dubbed the Fantastic Four and gave himself the codename “Human Torch” in honor of the World War II hero of the same name.\n \n\nFlamethrower\n\nStorm can ignite plasma across his entire body to become a literal human torch and control the resulting flames to an incredible degree. While he himself does not feel heat from the fire, he can project intense amounts of it or as little as he wishes and even shut off the flames to his head or arms or legs to allow others to touch him or to be able to manipulate objects without burning them. By increasing heat around himself, he can reach “nova” level, an output of heat beyond measure and devastatingly destructive.\n\nHis flames can also be flung or shot outwardly from his body in different ways, such as short contained bursts, streams, sheets, and ropes. The Torch may even fly by manipulating his flames to launch himself and become lighter than air. These powers arrive through mental concentration so if Storm becomes unconscious the flames will disappear. Likewise, if he’s exposed to water and other liquids or robbed of oxygen in his immediate area, he cannot maintain his fire.\n&nbsp;\n\nMoths to the Flame\n\nStorm’s outgoing personality, brash attitude, and handsome features have attracted others to him since he was a young teenager, most especially females. Undoubtedly, the closest connection he claims to anyone in his life would be his sister Sue, who virtually raised him in the absence of their parents. The Storm siblings have seen many challenges to their familial love, but in the end they would sacrifice their lives for each other.\n\nThe closest friend Johnny possesses of all would be Ben Grimm, the Fantastic Four’s strongman and heart. The Torch and the Thing squabble nearly constantly like children and purposefully try to get each other’s goat, but Storm and Grimm remain as close as brothers and know each other through and through. To a lesser extent, Reed Richards also stands as a brother figure to the Torch, but the two’s relationship has never extended as far as that between Johnny and Ben.\n\nAmong Storm’s many girlfriends and lovers, perhaps only Crystal of the Inhumans and Lyta the Skrull could be counted as true friends of his. The Torch has seen countless adventures with the two women, and has allowed the romantic love he once felt for both to evolve into solid companionship and camaraderie. As to male friends, the hero Spider-Man ranks high on that score, being about Storm’s age and also possessing a forthright drive and eclectic sense of humor.\n\nJohnny Storm enjoys the acquaintance of nearly all of Earth’s other colorful heroes, but often times most of them keep him at arm’s length, and not just due to his flames.\n&nbsp;\n\nA Light in the Darkness\n\nThe Fantastic Four has earned many enemies throughout the years, but chief among them stands Doctor Doom. Although Doom’s main hatred is reserved for Reed Richards, he views the Human Torch through a similar lens due to his association with Richards, but almost never truly sees the young hero as a real, credible threat. For his part, Storm distrusts Doom and will always set his fire against the Latverian monarch’s many plays for power.\n\nUnlike many other super heroes, the Human Torch cannot claim more than a few direct “arch-enemies,” though he did fight several foes in solo adventures, such as the Trapster, the Wizard, and Hydro-Man. In addition, despite Storm’s aid in reviving his memories after a long bout with amnesia, Namor the Sub-Mariner could never be counted as a fan of the fiery hero, most likely due to his being a member of the Fantastic Four and the inevitable rivalry between “fire” and “water.”\n&nbsp;",

Educated through public schooling, Johnny attended high school at P.S. 440. He spent his formative years at the Baxter Building labs; but despite his access to its high-tech resources, he rebelliously resisted taking advantage of this opportunity to learn.Johnny attended the test of Reed Richards' Nevada desert N-Zone teleportation device and was transported by its malfunction to France. Waking in a hospital bed there, he briefly burst into flame with no harm to himself.After being taken to the Baxter Building, he continually inadvertently burst into flame, slowly learning to control his combustion by reciting \"Flame On\" and \"Flame Off.\" When the Baxter Building was attacked by Arthur Molekevic's genetically constructed monster, Johnny accidentally burned through a window and fell from the skyscraper, discovering he could fly while aflame.\nAlone among the foursome, Johnny dreamed about using his powers to be a super-hero like the Ultimates; however, his father insisted Johnny finish high school, which he was coerced into attending. He registered at a school in Queens, and made friends quickly, meeting Liz Allen, Mary Jane Watson and Peter Parker, among others. When Johnny accidentally caught fire at a beach bonfire, he fled, returning only to ask Liz to meet with him so he could explain. Though Allen didn't show, Spider-Man did, and the two talked before cooperating to save people trapped in a burning building. Johnny's spirit was renewed by Spider-Man's contention that the drawbacks of super-powers are outweighed by the good they could do, and he shared with Spider-Man the name he would use when the team went public: the Human Torch. The Fantastic Four were forced to go public while battling the alien Nihil on the Las Vegas Sunset Strip; Johnny has since reveled in fame and the Fantastic Four's adventures.Through the course of his super-human career, Johnny has tangled with the great Gah-Lak-Tus entity and fought the mighty Thanos, but has yet to find his comfort with a steady girlfriend. Feeling let down by previous dates, Johhny returns to Midtown High and asks the young Liz Allan to have a date with him. She finally accepts and during the date, Liz reveals her true self as she spontaneously combusts around her startled friends, letting the secret out that she is now a Firestar",

      "biography": "Former Empire State University (ESU) senior entomology professor Buck Mitty is an eccentric scientist and inventor with an unusual fondness for insects. When the ESU regents cut off his funding  to validate his thesis that “insects are our friends”, Mitty turned to crime to continue his research. Wearing an amateur costume with gadgetry capable of various tricks via the amplification of insect noises, he tried to rob an armored car. Spider-Man foiled the bumbling attempt, forcing Humbug to turn his weaponry upon himself. Humbug was arrested, but the judge commuted his sentence to “time served”. Mitty immediately resumed his inept criminal tendencies, targeting ESU directly by stealing rare paintings on loan to the Art Department. When the attempt failed, he shifted sights to expensive super conductive ceramics in the Physics Building. Spider-Man captured Humbug after threatening a cruel end to a jar full of roaches. Humbug returned once again to harass the ESU faculty; this time, the obnoxious mercenary Deadpool was hired to kill the troublesome professor. Humbug deafened Deadpool with a hemorrhage around his ear drum, but the mercenary retaliated, covering Humbug with honey and South American fire ants. Humbug was left for dead, apparently eaten alive. While the outer layer of skin was being consumed, Humbug communicated with the ants, brokering a deal to exchange his life for a few younger and tastier victims. After Humbug kept his part of the bargain, Rodney, the leader of the fire ants, decided to stay with Humbug. Teaming with villains 8-Ball, Freezer Burn, and Whirlwind, Humbug robbed the wealthy publisher Ricadonna, unaware that she was an emerging crime-lord and that they stole a microchip with a computer virus that could destabilize the world economy. Unable to sell the stolen goods and with each of his colleagues murdered, Humbug turned himself over to bounty hunter Misty Knight. Ricadonna attacked Misty, severing her bionic arm holding the chip. Humbug summoned a massive swarm of insects against Ricadonna, who fled with the chip. The fact Ricadonna had the chip back in her possession saved Humbug from the wrath of the Mad Juggler. After using his bug network to locate Ricadonna’s auction for the microchip, Misty's partner Colleen Wing had Humbug arrested again. Most recently, Humbug has turned over a new leaf and is using his abilities for good, having joined the Heroes for Hire. During his time on the team, Ricadonna escaped from prison and hired Insecticide to put an end to Humbug's life. He also met Captain America, fought solo against the Headmen - which didn't end up in his favor - and traveled to the Savage Land where he was given power beyond his wildest dreams by the bug colony there. Unfortunately, the power disillusioned Humbug, and his alliances changed. Upon returning to New York, the Hulk had waged a war against the planet, and two of his Warbound - Miek and Brood - were about to begin a hive on Earth. Overcome by Brood's charm, Humbug decided to act as a vessel for her children and betrayed the Heroes for Hire. The bug colony of Earth didn't want Brood's offspring to hatch, and they chose Humbug knowing he would be incapable of bringing them full term. The foreign bodies within him were being poisoned and slowly and painfully killing Humbug. For betraying his friends and threatening their lives, an angry Shang-Chi granted Humbug his wish and ended his suffering by snapping his head off his body.",

      "biography": "Nathaniel Richards brought his daughter, a young Tara Richards, along with Franklin Richards to the court of the Warlord Kargul of Elsewhen, asking for help to train his grandson. Tara trained in the aspects of war alongside her nephew. But when Nathaniel Richards slipped away from Elsewhen, Tara, calling herself Huntara, became the guardian of the sacred timestreams alongside Franklin, who called himself Psi-Lord. Later, when Franklin himself joined his grandfather Huntara considered him a traitor. She traveled to Earth to stop him and destroy the Fantastic Four, whom she believed were a danger to the timestreams.Huntara appeared on the New York streets, declaring that she was the Warrior-Princess of Elsewhen who had come after the Four who must be destroyed. Klaw showed up and fought off the police for her and offered to direct her to the Fantastic Four. She joined up with Klaw, Paibok, and Devos to try and kill the Fantastic Four at the trial of the Human Torch. She fought with Mister Fantastic, explaining that she was a guardian of the time lines, and that he and his group threatened them. After dodging Daredevil’s attacks, she stabbed Reed from behind with her staff. When the Avengers joined the battle, Huntara used her scythe again, this time to tear a hole in the fabric of the universe and transport her allies. Daredevil also jumped in and floated in nothingness until Spider-Man saved him at the last moment with a well-placed webline.The rest transported to Paibok’s ship where Devos questioned her about her people, mining her for information in case he should want to destroy her people in his continued quest towards galactic peace. Shortly afterwards, she teleported them to Four Freedoms Plaza, where they searched Reed’s lab for something to use against the four, finding the mutated Ms. Marvel. When the team returned home, Huntara fought with Franklin, calling him the disciple of the Great Traitor, Nathaniel Richards, and urging him to destroy his family to save the timelines. When he refused, she opened a rift and pulled him in. They fought again in another dimension and then back to New York, where she tried to convince him that he already knew who the greatest threat was. When he realized, she left him to his choices and teleported out with her scythe.Franklin searched for Huntara, mentally summoning her, and she came to him and asked if he had made his decision. He explained that he thought the Dark Raider was the true enemy. They traveled to the castle of Warlord Kargul of Elsewhen and asked his help. He revealed that Nathaniel was the true enemy, and the Dark Raider was simply a murderer. Franklin didn’t like his answer and turned on Kargul. The castle guards attacked Franklin, and Huntara stood by his side, as he was family. They escaped the castle together to search for the Dark Raider. Together, they arrived at the roof of Four Freedoms Plaza. There they met the Black Panther, who had brought Vibraxas and Devlor - two youths he asked to join him - hoping to help the Fantastic Four. Franklin revealed that the Dark Raider had already breached the building. Together they battled the Dark Raider, revealed to be an alternate Reed, until Franklin transmitted the Malice entity he had hidden in his mind, from his mother’s psyche, into the Dark Raider, distracting him. Uatu The Watcher then materialized and killed the Dark Raider and left moments later. Then, while Susan left to find her Reed, Johnny left in anger over his estranged wife-Lyja’s-lies, and Ben was left alone; Huntara and Franklin created the group Fantastic Force to fill the gap that remained. Though the group later disbanded when the original Reed Richards returned.",

      "biography": "When his project on diffusing hurricanes was cancelled, meteorologist Albert Potter piloted an experimental weather control craft into the heart of Hurricane Linda in a desperate bid to prove his theories. His vehicle could partially control the storm, but Potter had drawn the attention of Otherworld’s Nethergods, who sought a pawn to destroy their enemy Merlyn’s champion, Captain Britain; Potter’s craft was struck repeatedly by lightning and exploded. Bathed in strange energies, Potter was transformed. Rescued by a passing ship, he returned to Britain convinced his vehicle had been sabotaged. Abandoning his former life, he spent months in hiding designing a control harness to focus his powers, then attacked London’s Thames University as Hurricane, wishing to test his new abilities against Captain Britain. Potter easily overpowered the novice hero, but Captain Britain subsequently tore off Hurricane’s backpack in a later bout; without its cooling system, the villain violently overheated and was taken into custody. Sent to Darkmoor prison, Potter underwent genetic experiments run by Dr. Samuel Merrick of STORM (Special Taskforce Omega Response Mandate) in return for a lessened sentence. His DNA was mixed with a soldier ant’s, giving him additional powers, but also leaving him nearly dead. The criminal conspiracy Mys-Tech revived him to steal a Gene Scanner from STORM, bringing him into conflict with Q7 Strikeforce, agents of Mys-Tech rival Takashei Otomo, and STORM’s Gene Dogs; it took the combined might of both teams to overpower him. Hurricane was frozen while Merrick worked on curing the damage he’d caused.Merrick apparently succeeded, and Potter was released, a reformed character. He reconciled with his estranged wife and children, relocating to New York. Unable to find work, and wanting to get Christmas presents for his children, he broke into a toy store, only to be caught by the Fantastic Four. Realizing Potter’s motives, the group decided to give him a second chance on condition that he stay on the straight and narrow; rather than handing him to the authorities, the Four instead celebrated Christmas with the Potter family.",

      "biography": "Isolated from his alien race after his ship crashed on Earth, an unidentified Dire Wraith shape-shifter, weary of warfare, opted to become human. As farmer Jacob Marks, he courted the human Marjorie Seaton to enhance his disguise; much to his surprise, he fell in love with her. They married, and a hesitant Jacob eventually gave in to his wife’s desire to have children. To Jacob’s relief, their son Jimmy appeared completely human. However, when Jimmy was 15, the Wraith elders finally found Jacob, and insisted on examining Jimmy’s potential; Jacob reluctantly acquiesced, allowing Jimmy to be exposed to Wraith magic and the truth of his ancestry. The boy became cold, callous and cruel; even the Wraiths feared him as Jimmy’s powers swiftly surpassed his mentors. Jimmy’s mother attempted to reach him, but when the elders stopped coming, either slain or driven away by the Spaceknight Rom, Jimmy turned on her; realizing his son was evil, Jacob tried to kill Jimmy, but the boy repelled his attack, then aged Marjorie nearly to death as punishment. Having deduced Jacob was a Wraith, Rom confronted the boy. Calling himself Hybrid, he attacked Rom and slew his father. While Rom and Hybrid fought, Hybrid informed his foe of his plan to force humans and Wraiths to breed and create a new race. Their battle was interrupted by the X-Men, who had detected a new mutant. Hybrid tricked them into fighting Rom, but soon attacked both sides and was apparently destroyed by Rom’s neutralizer, wielded by the X-Men’s Sprite (Kitty Pryde).Reintegrating himself months later, Hybrid briefly allied with the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants’ Mystique, Rogue and Destiny (Irene Adler) to battle Rom again. Learning of Hybrid’s depraved plans for them, the trio changed sides; Rogue absorbed some of Hybrid’s powers, weakening him enough to allow Rom to disperse his atoms again. Hybrid reformed several months later, soon overpowering Rom and his fellow Spaceknight Starshine, and battling the New Mutants. Magik (Illyana Rasputin) used her soul sword to disrupt Hybrid’s concentration, allowing Starshine (now human again thanks to Hybrid’s magic) to once more disperse him with Rom’s neutralizer.Hybrid again reformed, but his mind was fractured. In Jimmy’s amnesiac form he reached out telepathically to X-Man (Nate Grey), tricking him into reintegrating his mind. Hybrid fought X-Man, only to be blasted to atoms once more.",

      "biography": "After producing his first offspring (Carnage), Venom (Eddie Brock) was captured by corporate survivalists the Life Foundation, whereupon five additional symbiote seeds were extracted from Eddie's symbiote. To create a team of super-powered protectors, these five spawn underwent an artificially accelerated maturation and were attached to the Life Foundation's top five security personnel: Carl Mach, Leslie Gesneria, Ramon Hernandez, Trevor Cole and Donna Diego. When Donna, (who later adopted the name \"Scream\") went insane, she murdered the other four symbiotes' hosts though in the midst of fighting Venom, she did not have time to check if the actual symbiotes were dead. The four symbiotes were alive, and later taken to the Vault to be studied.Scott Washington became one of the 35 armored Guardsmen to guard the Vault, a prison for superhuman criminals. Working there he befriended one of the convicts named Vance Astrovik. He and other Guardsmen were transferred to guard Facility #12, where scientists were studying four alien symbiotes. The symbiotes escaped from their containers and molded together to form a single unified symbiote. This composite symbiote tried to merge with Scott while letting Scott feel the pain of the four entities. Scott Washington realized that the symbiotes weren't evil and that the experiments were causing them great pain. So he later let them escape the complex. When Scott's superiors discovered that he had released the symbiotes he was supposed to be guarding they fired him.Months later, back in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Scott was working as a security guard in local warehouse. Local Eazy X gang members choose to make Scott in an example to others. One night the gang made a drive-by shooting on Scott's house and the bullets hit his brother and him. As a result, his brother died and Scott was paralyzed from the waist down. Consumed with helpless rage, Scott was approached by the composite symbiote that had tracked him as a sympathetic host. When Scott bonded with the symbiote, he regained his ability to walk. He still holds lots of anger, saying that it is oftentimes the symbiotes that prevent him from wreaking acts of violence, and some cases the other way around. Unlike other symbiote hosts, who hear an extra voice in their heads, Scott has four additional voices in his head.Naming himself Hybrid, Scott then waged war against the Eazy Xs. He finally brought the gang that had shot his brother and himself to face the law with the help of his friend Justice. He began to get a lot of attention from the press, which in turn attracted the attention of the armored vigilantes the Jury - most of them former Guardsmen with grudges against Venom and symbiotes in general. They captured him and tried to separate him from the symbiote. At the same time Justice had heard of the capture and set out to save him with his teammates Turbo and Powerpax. They tracked Hybrid to the Jury's base. Although the Jury's leaders were by now convinced they had misjudged Hybrid, the symbiotes remained vengeful, and the New Warriors' arrival escalated hostilities further. Finally calming his merged friends, Scott ended the conflict and was invited to join the New Warriors. Hybrid declined the offer and is still cleaning his neighborhood from criminals.",

Physically and emotionally unstable, Bench dubbed himself Hydro-Man and soon attacked Spider-Man, but he evaporated after Spider-Man scattered his liquid form amidst the hot sunshine of the New York rooftops; however, the particles of Bench's body soon reintegrated, and he embarked on a long criminal career.\n\nWhen Bench and rival criminal Sandman fought over the affections of barfly Sadie Frickett, the two men accidentally merged into a monstrous \"mud-thing\" that the police were ultimately forced to dehydrate into seemingly inert rubble. Hydro-Man and Sandman eventually managed to separate back into their original forms, but both were humiliated and traumatized by the experience. Sandman was so shaken that he went straight for years (until the Wizard brainwashed him into returning to crime), while Hydro-Man did most of his criminal work in groups from that point on, perhaps seeking safety in numbers.\n\nBoth alone and as a member of teams like the Sinister Syndicate, the Frightful Four and the Assembly of Evil, Bench fought a wide array of foes such as Silver Sable, Sandman, the Fantastic Four, Cloak &amp; Dagger, the Avengers, the New Warriors, Thunderstrike, the Thunderbolts, Gambit and Black Panther, but most often clashed with Spider-Man. Hydro-Man was one of many super-criminals employed by corrupt billionaire Justin Hammer for a time, and later served in the Masters of Evil assembled by Hammer's daughter Justine, alias the Crimson Cowl; however, after Justine's arrest and the apparent death of Justin, Hammer Industries phased out its criminal enterprises and Bench, along with fellow employee the Shocker, was laid off. The Shocker and Hydro-Man then teamed up for one last crime, seeking enough money to retire, but Hydro-Man's thirst for revenge against Spider-Man led to their defeat. Trying and failing to go straight, Bench was recruited back into the Wizard's Frightful Four and, more recently, the Sinister Twelve.",

      "biography": "Hyperion was sent to Earth as a baby and raised by agents of the United States government in a secret government compound by a pseudo-family, under the auspices of a normal childhood, with the name Mark Milton. His powers began to develope early. He, and the scientists observing him, discovered that he had vast superhuman strength, resistance to injury, and speed. At the age of one, his \"flash vision\" manifested and killed a puppy hand selected for him by his captors. Later he discovered that through intense concentration, he could see through solid objects, that his senses were hundreds of times more acute than that of an ordinary human, and that he could fly at faster than escape velocity. Government agents begin to manipulate him into becoming a weapon for the U.S. government, regardless of his own desires. As a young man, in lieu of Washington Herald reporter Jason Scott's investigation into strange stories involving military operations, he is revealed to humanity by the government as a hero and government operative, dubbed Hyperion.\n\nAs Hyperion began to question his role, the government faked the death of his foster parents to increase Mark's dependence on them. Hyperion was blamed for acts of pro-American violence. Seeking to clear his name, he tracked down the culprit, who turned out to be Colonel Joe Ledger, better known as Doctor Spectrum. The two fought a long and devastating battle in which Hyperion accidentally touched Spectrum's power crystal, which came from Mark's ship. As a result, he received memories of his journey to Earth.\n\nMark began to seek out proof of his origin hidden by the government. He confronted the commander of the project that raised him, and he learned about his life. The project manager activated a self-destruct sequence that created an immense shockwave provided by 20 \"daisy-cutter\" bombs. Hyperion barely survived and was saved by the insane Zarda, who nursed him and explained they were of the same origin and had been sent to Earth to dominate it.\n\nHyperion re-emerged, and along with Nighthawk and the Blur, captured serial killer Michael Redstone who was transformed by the government from a strand of mutagenic DNA found on the spaceship that brought Hyperion to Earth. As a result of the government's actions in the empowerment of Redstone and in his upbringing, Mark decided he was outside the system. General Alexander, who is in charge of the government's superhumans, asked Hyperion to work with them again, but he refused.\n\nThe government retaliated by revealing to the media that Hyperion was an extraterrestrial. The American people, who had once embraced Hyperion as a hero, became terrified of him. Feared by what he used to believe was his fellow man and disgusted with the government's actions, Mark sent Alexander an ultimatum, punctuated by an extraordinary show of force: stop interfering with him; America and the Human Race are to now play by his rules. If the government would not fix the damage they had done to his reputation, then there would be consequences for the government and the people of Earth. The government sent a strikeforce after Hyperion consisting of super genius Emil Burbank, the reality altering Arcanna Jones, the radioactive Nuke, and the superhumanly durable Shape. Becoming embroiled in a conflict with the governments strike team, Hyperion and the other four superhumans were transported to an alternate timeline where the United States had turned into a superhuman dictatorship ruled by Hyperion. Hyperion met his alternate reality counterpart who revealed that his Earth was not an alternate reality, but two years in the future from the home reality. Hyperion returned to the present, but not before the alternate Hyperion told his past self how he implemented his world order.\n\nUpon returning to the present Hyperion agreed to join the government's team, the Squadron Supreme. Meeting with reporter Jason Scott, Hyperion revealed the names of all of the operatives that the government had been considering for the Squadron, both for the public team and the covert team, thereby forcing all of the team to go public.\n\n*NOTE - This Hyperion is not to be confused with the Hyperion from Earth-712, the Grandmaster created Hyperion from Earth-616, the prime Marvel Universe, the Hyperion who was a part of the multiversal Heralds on Earth X, or King Hyperion who has fought with the Exiles on a few occasions.",

      "biography": "Jay is the son of Thomas Zebulon Guthrie, also referred to as \"Ty\" and \"Zeke,\" and Lucinda Guthrie. Jay's older siblings Sam (Cannonball) and Paige (Husk) are mutants as well, and both have been members of the X-Men. Another of their siblings, Jeb, has developed the mutant ability to project electricity from his eyes, as well as his sister Melody (a.k.a. Aero) who was de-powered during House of M|M-Day. He has several other human brothers and sisters, and his whole family is generally hated by his home town due to the fact that they all seem to be developing mutant powers. When Sam and Paige left home to become X-men, Jay took over the role of the father in the house, feeling that he had to protect his younger brothers and sisters.When he himself developed mutant powers, (red, angel-like wings that allow him to fly, strong regenerative abilities, and can vocally mimic any sound he hears or imagines; for example, he can sound like a whole choir when he sings) he hid them from his family. However, when performing in his band he exposed his wings to the crowd as a 'stage gimmick'.Jay fell in love with Julia Cabot, but due to a long feud between the Guthries and the Cabots a fight broke out. Jay was struck down by Julia's father, who had acquired and modified some superpowered armor. Believing Jay to be dead, Julia dragged Jay's body to the river. She wrapped his arms around her, heading for the deepest part of the river. The two sank to the river's bottom and Julia subsequently drowned. Neither Jay nor Julia were aware of Jay's mutant regenerative powers, but when Jay sank to the bottom of the river, these powers manifested. Jay awoke at the bottom of the river with Julia in his arms. He swam to the surface with her and brought her to the riverbank. When he discovered she was dead, he tried (unsuccessfully due to his healing factor) to stab himself in the heart with a sharp piece of wood. Warren Worthington arrived on the scene, found Jay, and helped him carry Julia's body back to the Guthrie house.After Julia's death, Jay attempted to kill himself a few more times, hoping his healing factor would fail. Eventually his mother sent him to the Xavier Institute against his will. Jay speculated this was just so she wouldn't feel guilt if he tried to hurt himself again. Originally placed with the Hellions squad, he traded places with Wither and joined the New Mutants. He is portrayed as a sullen, withered lover who keeps mostly to himself, but he always reminds his teammates how fortunate they are to be a \"family\" when they feud. His team seems to talk to him about their problems, as he isn't usually one to join the fights.After the events of Decimation, Icarus was one of the few of the New Mutants team who didn't lose their powers. However, someone cut off his wings and left him bleeding at the doorsteps of the mansion. Emma Frost has stated that his healing factor was not working to heal these injuries. It was later revealed by Dr. McCoy that his healing powers came from his wings and without them this power won't work.Jay was, seemingly, tricked by William Stryker. Stryker told Jay if he gave his wings \"back to god\" his friends would be saved by Stryker. He called Stryker to inform him the children were leaving on a bus, which led to the bombing of the bus carrying the de-powered students, and the assassination of Wallflower, as she was the one in Nimrod's vision of the future that killed the Purifiers. As X-23 put it to Dust after he gave her a piece of paper containing the address of Stryker's church, he shouldn't be trusted because \"he smells like death\". Choosing not to trust Jay, X-23 went to the church disguised as Dust, only to be gunned down upon entering. After this, Stryker confessed he was responsible for the death of Julia Cabot before he shot Jay, killing him.",

      "biography": "Bobby Drake discovered his mutant power to create ice while in his early teens, yet kept his condition hidden from everyone but his parents. Initially, Bobby was unable to stop feeling cold and shivering, but soon managed to keep it under control. When a bully named Rocky Beasely and his friends attacked Bobby and his then-girlfriend, Judy Harmon, the youngster panicked. To save Harmon, Bobby temporarily encased Rocky in ice, thus revealing his abilities for all to see. Believing the boy to be a menace, the townspeople organized a lynch mob. They broke into Bobby's home and overpowered him, but the local sheriff took the teenager into custody for his own protection. Meanwhile, the situation had come to the attention of Professor Charles Xavier, the telepathic mentor of the team of teenage mutant super heroes the X-Men.\n\nProfessor X dispatched his first X-Man, Cyclops, to contact Bobby. Cyclops stole into the jailhouse as planned, but the two began fighting when Bobby refused to accompany him. Caught by the lynch mob, Cyclops and Bobby were about to be hanged when they broke free. Professor X used his mental powers to halt the townspeople in their tracks and erase their memories of Bobby's powers. A grateful Bobby then accepted Xavier's invitation to enroll at his School for Gifted Youngsters and took the codename Iceman. Though initially granting him a snow-like form, Bobby soon learned to increase his degree of cold control resulting in an ice-like, almost transparent form.\n\nHated and feared by humanity, the X-Men honed their amazing abilities while standing in defense of a world pushed to the brink of genetic war by a handful of mutant terrorists. Iceman, the team's youngest founding member, became known as the comedian of the group. Regardless, he pulled his weight and worked well with rest of the team.\n\nFollowing a short break-up after believing their mentor was dead, the X-Men reformed with two new members - the magnetism-manipulating Polaris and the plasma-charged Havok. Bobby had a brief romantic relationship with Polaris until she realized that her heart belonged to Havok. Bobby had trouble accepting her decision, which led to increased tension between himself and Havok. Eventually, Bobby quit the team for a short time to sort out his feelings.\n\nLater, when the sentient island-being known as Krakoa took Bobby and his team mates captive, Professor X assembled a second team of X-Men to rescue them. Soon after, most of the founding members left the team and Bobby began attending college on a scholarship. Eventually, he helped his former team mate Angel form the Champions of Los Angeles. When the Champions disbanded, Bobby went missing, and Angel teamed up with the costumed adventurer Spider-Man to find him. Bobby had been hypnotized by the Champions' enemy Rampage into donning his battle suit, and Angel and Spider-Man were forced to battle him. After Rampage was defeated, Bobby quit his life as a costumed adventurer and returned to college full time to study accounting.\n\nLater, Bobby was contacted by Professor X to assist in rescuing friends and family of the X-Men from the assassin known as Arcade. Along with other former X-Men Banshee, Polaris, and Havok, the ad-hoc team managed to free the hostages and Bobby finally came to accept Polaris' love for Havok.\n\nDuring a summer break from college Bobby went to visit his former X-Men teammate Beast and soon became involved with the loose-knit collection of costumed heroes known as the Defenders. Along with Beast and Angel, Bobby helped reorganize the team into a more formal and cohesive unit. The Defenders eventually disbanded when several of their members appeared to perish during a climactic battle.\n\nSoon after, Bobby joined the other founding X-Men to form X-Factor, an organization that intended to seek out and aid other mutants under the pretense of hunting down those perceived menaces to society. During his time with the team, the Asgardian trickster god Loki captured Bobby, hoping to use him to gain control over the Frost Giants. Loki enhanced Bobby's powers to such an extent that he was forced to wear a power-dampening belt that was originally created by the subversive organization known as The Right to cancel out his powers. Once able only to sheathe his own body in a protective coating of ice, Bobby found he could encase the entirety of the Empire State Building. With time, Bobby gained sufficient control over his augmented powers that he was able to stop using the inhibitor belt. Believing he had achieved his full potential, Bobby never attempted to push himself beyond his perceived limits.\n\nWhen Professor Xavier returned to Earth following an extended absence in outer space, Bobby and the other members of X-Factor rejoined the X-Men. Shortly thereafter, Bobby confronted former Cosmonaut Mikhail Rasputin, the reality-warping mutant brother of Bobby’s steel-skinned teammate Colossus. Rasputin forced Bobby into a form composed entirely of ice, affording the young mutant a glimpse into his true nature. Subsequently, Bobby began experimenting with his abilities - using ice to add mass to his slight frame, or lift himself high into the air without the benefit of his usual slides.\n\nMonths later, the psychically incapacitated mutant telepath Emma Frost took mental possession of Bobby's body. Frost was able to activate the full extent of his powers, using his powers in ways Bobby had not thought possible until she was coaxed back into her own body by Professor X. With Frost's prodding, Iceman later learned to completely transform his body into its full ice state on his own. Frost later also showed Bobby that he could safely revert back to his human form after his ice form's chest had been shattered in battle.\n\nBobby later took a leave of absence from the X-Men to spend more time with his father who had been injured by the grass roots anti-mutant movement the Friends of Humanity. He returned briefly to the X-Men to rescue mutant doctor Cecilia Reyes during the government-sponsored anti-mutant Operation: Zero Tolerance, after which he returned to his father's side.\n\nTwo subsequent events served to shed further light on Iceman's untapped potential. To secure a new host body, the would-be conqueror Apocalypse sought to siphon the awesome energies of \"The Twelve\" - mutants of incredible power, destined to alter the course of human history. Among their number was Iceman, who survived the ordeal thanks only to the apparent sacrifice of Cyclops.\n\nA second defining event occurred when the sentient spaceship Prosh escaped the confines of a Celestial prison, returned to Earth and dispatched a group of disparate beings on a journey through time to uncover the keys to preserving human evolution. Their mission: Save the human race from a threat that might not manifest itself for millions of years. When Prosh reassembled the members of his team in the present, they fought and defeated the enigmatic alien entity known as the Stranger, who sought to control the natural evolution of humans and mutants.\n\nThese experiences forced Iceman into the realization that he no longer need fear the evolution of his abilities, and he returned to the X-Men to explore his mutant powers to the fullest. After suffering a chest injury, Bobby was unable to prevent his body from transforming into solid ice due to the manifestation of a secondary mutation.\n\nAfter the House of M incident Iceman was believed to be among the mutants who lost their powers, but this apparent loss of powers was quickly revealed to be a subconscious reaction to the trauma of that reality warp. Since recovering his powers, his ice form has taken on a much more jagged appearance.\n\nRecently, Iceman has been using his powers in innovative ways, including the ability to exist as a sentient gas. He discovered this ability while fighting the Children of the Vault when they attacked the Mansion. After the fight with the Children, he joined Rogue's team of X-Men.",

      "biography": "When Sentinels began attacking innocent mutants in U.S. cities, young Bobby Drake, who had recently discovered his own ice-forming powers, ran away from home to protect his parents. The Sentinels caught up with him in Times Square, but so did the newly formed X-Men, who rescued him and took him in. Dubbed Iceman by his team mate the Beast, Bobby battled the Brotherhood of Mutants alongside the X-Men, rescuing the President's kidnapped daughter and bringing about the end of the government-sponsored Sentinel attacks. The X-Men later fought reprogrammed Sentinels in Washington, saving many innocent lives. After spending some time back with his parents, he returned to the X-Men only to be kidnapped by Weapon X; following several weeks in captivity, the X-Men were freed by the Brotherhood. Iceman confronted his deepest fears while fighting telepathic mutant David Xavier (son of X-Men founder Charles Xavier) in Scotland. During a rematch with David in Berlin, Bobby's terror initially immobilized him. Urged on by Professor X, he overcame his fear when his team mate Storm was threatened; he was severely injured.. Bobby spent weeks in the hospital, and his parents withdrew him from the school. The family's medical bills were paid by anti-mutant Senator Andrew Border Turk, who then pushed the Drake family to sue Xavier for $50 million, hoping to put the school out of business. Since Bobby's father lost his job when people found out he had a mutant child, the Drakes agreed. At a live press conference, Bobby refused to read Turk's prepared statement, instead dropping the action, stating he knew the risks of the mission and had learned integrity from Xavier. When the X-Men became fugitives after it was revealed Xavier had lied about killing Brotherhood leader Magneto, Iceman defied his parents and helped the X-Men escape the Ultimates. The X-Men subsequently captured Magneto and saved the world, publicly redeeming themselves.Bobby began dating his team mate Rogue, but foolishly kissed Kitty Pryde at the Coney Island fair, hurting Rogue. She soon left the X-Men in the company of Gambit, much to Bobby's distress. Iceman accompanied Marvel Girl, Cyclops and Kitty to Genosha to investigate whether Longshot was truly a murderer, and during the trip he and Kitty became a couple. However, Kitty dumped him when she learned he was still in touch with Rogue by e-mail, and clearly still in love with her.",

      "biography": "POWERS\n\n\nIkaris possesses the conventional abilities of the Eternals of Earth. His body is augmented by cosmic energy, and he has total mental control over his entire molecular structure. He is virtually immune to injury, and can regenerate his entire body if need be. He is also immune to disease, aging and extreme temperatures. Only total molecular dispersal can kill an Eternal.\n\nIkaris can manipulate gravitons to enable himself and others to levitate at speeds up to 850 miles per hour. Ikaris is said to be the fastest flier of all the Eternals. He also possesses telepathy, is able to cast low-level illusions, and can rearrange the molecules of other substances. Ikaris usually employs illusions to alter his appearance. In combat, he wields cosmic energy to enhance his physical strength (lifting over 40 tons) and durability, and can release energy from his hands and eyes in the form of heat, light or concussive force. At maximum intensity, he can vaporize solid matter. He also possesses the ability to teleport, but seldom utilizes this power because of the discomfort it causes him. He has honed his senses so that he can detect the Celestials from light-years away.\n\nAs the Prime Eternal Ikaris’ power was greater than that of other Eternals; he could also manfiest the Blue Flame, a unique energy required to reshape the physical forms of Eternals, humans and/or Deviants into a Uni-Mind, a psychic entity with the combined power of all those participating in its creation.\n\nIkaris is also an experienced hand-to-hand combatant, including human wrestling styles. He can construct various mechanical devices, including battleships.\n\nORIGIN\n\n\nIkaris is a member of the Eternals, a near-immortal evolutionary offshoot of humanity created by the Celestials. He was born over twenty thousand years ago under another name which has not been revealed. Ikaris’ family belonged to a community of Eternals who dwelt in the city of Polaria, calling themselves Polar Eternals, while most of the other Eternals lived in the city of Olympia. When the continents of Atlantis and Lemuria were sunk circa 18,500 B.C. by the Second Host of the Celestials in what was known as the Great Cataclysm, Ikaris helped guide an ark of refugees led by fellow Eternal Utnapishtim to safety. The humans aboard the vessel mistook Ikaris for a bird, and the tale became a part of common human folklore, like many of the Eternals’ encounters with humanity. During the Second Host’s time on Earth, they disciplined one of their number by releasing its cosmic energies from its armor. The inanimate Celestial was buried deep beneath the Earth, and became known as “the Dreaming Celestial.” The weapon used to disperse the Celestial and the being’s cosmic essence were entombed within the Pyramid of the Four Winds, an Arctic facility constructed by Ikaris’ father Virako and uncle Valkin. Valkin designed a security feature that would alert Ikaris if anyone should breach the facility, and Ikaris was one of the only Eternals to know what the Pyramid contained.\n\nIn the centuries that followed, Ikaris became a constant opponent of the Deviants, the misshapen race who were also creations of the Celestials. Although Ikaris was quick to oppose Deviants himself, other Eternals judged him as brash and headstrong. His closest friends among his people were the speedster Makkari, the hedonistic Sersi, and Thena, daughter of their leader Zuras. In the times of ancient Greece, Ikaris fell in love with a human woman he met in Crete while battling Deviants, and she gave birth to a son named Ikaris. The younger Ikaris, not sharing his father’s entire Eternal heritage, enjoyed being carried by the elder Ikaris when he flew. The elder Ikaris had his comrades Phastos and Makkari construct a flight harness that would enable the younger Ikaris to fly on his own; however, before he could properly instruct his son in the use of the device, the elder Ikaris was drawn into more battles with the Deviants, and was away from his son for years. The younger Ikaris resolved to find his father using the flight harness, but he soared too high into the atmosphere and fainted from lack of oxygen. The sun’s rays burned out the harness’ controls, and he fell from the sky into the ocean. The elder Ikaris buried his son, and took the name “Ikaris” as his own from then on so that some memory of his son would endure for centuries.\n\nAs the Eternals prepared for the coming of the Fourth Host, the gathering of Celestials who would determine the fate of the Earth, Zuras assigned Ikaris to hone his senses so that he could anticipate the Host’s arrival. In the time leading up to the Fourth Host, Ikaris befriended Black Bolt, ruler of the Inhumans, another sub-species of humanity, and the Eternals helped the Inhumans relocate their city Attilan from the Atlantic Ocean to the Himalayan mountains. Ikaris also befriended the time- displaced hero Yankee Clipper, who had once been the leader of the First Line. At some point in his adventures, Ikaris became an enemy of the long-lived mutant Apocalypse.\n\nAt the time of the Fourth Host’s arrival, Ikaris had adopted the human guise of “Ike Harris” and posed as a guide to archaeologist Dr. Daniel Damian and his daughter Margo. Ikaris led the Damians to the City of the Space Gods, an outpost in the Andes mountains where the Third Host had been based. The Deviants attempted to prevent the Fourth Host’s arrival, but Ikaris awakened his friend Ajak, who had been in suspended animation since the Third Host’s departure. Ajak opened communications with the Fourth Host, and their ship came into Earth’s orbit.\n\nWhile Dr. Damian remained with Ajak in the Andes, Ikaris introduced Margo to the world of the Eternals, and they became lovers. Ikaris joined the Eternals in revealing their existence to the public of Earth in order to quell humanity’s fearfulness of the Celestials. After Zuras formed a Uni-Mind to determine how to proceed with the Fourth Host, it was revealed that all races would have to act as one. To this end&nbsp;\n\nIkaris aided humanity against a robotic Hulk which had been animated by the Uni-Mind’s energies, and battled the Deviant Dromedan in the streets of New York. When Ikaris’ wicked cousin Druig attempted to obtain the Celestials’ weapon from the Pyramid of the Four Winds, he captured Ikaris and tortured him to learn of its location. Ikaris pursued Druig, and ultimately destroyed him to prevent him from wielding the weapon. While investigating a Deviant outpost beneath New York City, the Eternals became allies with the Asgardian god Thor, and they brought him back to Olympia. Thor fought with them against an alliance his father Odin had made with the Gods of Olympus to oppose the Eternals. The Eternals and Olympians’ conflict came to a draw, and the Eternals joined forces with the Asgardians to confront the Fourth Host. All of the Eternals merged into a Uni-Mind, but the Celestials easily defeated it, killing Zuras. In the end, the Celestials judged in Earth’s favor and departed in peace, erasing humanity’s memories of them, the Deviants, and Eternals.\n\nSoon after, many of the Eternals chose to leave Earth and explore space, causing the numbers on Earth to dwindle. Zuras’ daughter Thena became Prime Eternal, but she and Ikaris clashed on matters of authority as Ikaris became aware of a Deviant plot to awaken the Dreaming Celestial. When Thena’s love for the Deviant Warlord Kro compromised her leadership, Ikaris won the title of Prime Eternal from her and, aided by the Avengers, prevented the Dreaming Celestial from returning. Sadly, Margo Damian was killed during the conflict by the Deviants, and Ikaris buried her on an island where he had laid to rest dozens of his lovers from over the centuries.\n\nMargo’s death drove her father insane, and he utilized Celestial technology to try to destroy the Eternals and Deviants, but he was finally stopped and killed by his one-time friend Ajak. Later, Ikaris was among the heroes of Earth who aided Quasar in his pursuit of the Starblasters, extraterrestrial mercenaries who were seeking the all-powerful Star Brand (an energy source from Earth). During the adventure, Ikaris was captured by the Starblasters and split in two by their scientist Insidio, but Black Bolt helped hold Ikaris’ body together, and he survived the experience.\n\nWhen Apocalypse increased the mutations of the Deviants to make them run amok, Ikaris led a party of Eternals to halt the rampages, and reintroduced his people to humanity. To avoid upsetting humans, Ikaris and the other Eternals posed as super-heroes called “the New Breed,” and Ikaris referred to himself as “Sovereign.”\n\nRecently, the mischievous Eternal Sprite used the Dreaming Celestial’s power to generate an illusion that caused all of Earth’s Eternals to believe themselves to be ordinary humans. Initially a disheveled&nbsp;homeless person as “Ike Harris,” Ikaris eventually regained his faculties and began to gather other Eternals to face the Dreaming Celestial, which had begun a new judgment over the Earth. Ikaris and the other Eternals set out to reawaken their fellow Eternals to prepare for an eventual confrontation with the Horde, enemies of the Celestials.",

      "biography": "Deep in Earth’s future, the time-traveling conqueror Kang came to find his excursions into time left him unfulfilled, and he decided to give up worldly conquests and meditate on the nature of time until the end of his days. Thus, he journeyed to Limbo, a dimension that exists outside the timestream itself and built a castle, lording over the wanders of Limbo, the Space Phantoms.At some point after this, Immortus was contacted by the trinity of beings known as the Time-Keepers to oversee the 80 millenia of their existence and keep humanity (and especially the hero team known as the Avengers) from expanding into space-- a prospect of which would have disastrous prospects in nearly 50% of all the multiverse. Immortus acted as \"custodian\" of this timeline, and acted many times to influence events that keep humans from exploring space, all under the guise of embarking “on a number of campaigns to untangle the skein of timelines.\"These early machinations included sending a Space Phantom to break up an early incarnation of the Avengers and helping the early version of the Masters of Evil. During this last excursion, Immortus witnessed the bravery of Captain America, which forever would allow him a grudging respect for the Avengers. Thus, instead of destroying the Avengers, Immortus would subversively shepherd them to his own ends, such as manipulating events so that Thor would relinquish his hammer's time-travelling capabilities.Immortus also set out so that the Scarlet Witch would not conceive children (who have the potential to stand among the greatest forces of the universe.) Immortus helped to instigate the relationship between the Scarlet Witch and the Vision, thinking that no children would be born of this union, and Immortus officiated the ceremony that married the two. When this tactic failed, Immortus investigated the origin of the children, and manipulated events to reveal that the children were in fact pieces of the demon Mephisto's soul. Immortus also took the opportunity to influence the dismantling of the Vision's robotic body and mind. Immortus tried to stop the Scarlet Witch once and for all banishing her from reality, but was instead seemingly banished himself. Immortus was saved by the Time Keepers and re-instated as their custodian.Immortus ultimately blundered, however, when the Avengers chose to involve themselves in the Kree-Shi'ar War. Immortus had instilled within their team member Iron Man a temporary sense of xenophobia, hoping to drive the Avengers back to Earth. Instead, Iron Man helped other Avengers to execute the Kree leadership embodied by the Supreme Intelligence. This act spawned many possible futures, all of which ultimately showed the Avengers driven into becoming fascist \"protectors\" of space. Thus, Immortus brought about the very timelines he was charged with preventing. To keep the Avengers distracted, Immortus influenced Iron Man again, this time allowing Iron Man to turn villainous and murder various Avengers associates. Immortus also personally engaged the Avengers under the pretense of being Kang, alongside a version of Mantis and other versions of men and women Avengers had known-- all of which were Space Phantoms in disguise. The tactic proved so distracting that the Avengers never recovered, and when many of their number seemingly sacrificed themselves to end the psychic menace of Onslaught, the Avengers disbanded.A year later, however, the heroes returned to Earth and soon re-formed the Avengers. At this point, Immortus tried to stop what he believed was the ultimate cause of humanity's destiny by killing Avengers' associate Rick Jones. Instead, Immortus was stopped by Kang, who had just emerged from an identity crisis and would rather destroy Immortus than to be fated to become him. Forced into a war with Kang, Immortus ultimately captured Kang's Forever Crystal. With the Forever Crystal, Immortus could make sweeping changes throughout the timestream just as a gardener would prune unwanted branches. Jones brought various versions of the Avengers throughout time to confront Immortus. The Avengers eventually learned the truth of Immortus' many manipulations and, alongside Kang, the occultist Libra, and the Supreme Intelligence, confronted Immortus and the Time Keepers to convince them of their injustice. To stop Kang, the Time Keepers sought to warp time, to force Kang to bodily merge into Immortus. Kang's will, however, proved too strong, and he ripped himself away. The castoff, Immortus, remained distinct from his previous incarnation, as reality reshaped itself so that both men existed separately at the same time. Immortus, rejuvenated by the experience, vanished into the timestream to contemplate the matter.At some future point, Immortus will have vanished from Limbo under unrevealed circumstances. During this time, his son Marcus will rule in Limbo.",

      "biography": "On the planet Poppup in the 10th Galaxy, a world inhabited by numerous dangerous species, the native intelligent lifeforms developed complete control of their own molecules as a defense, allowing them to instantaneously transform into anything they could imagine. Eventually they tamed their planet and developed a group mind; while they had individual personalities, each one instantly knew what any others experienced. Shortly after the Fantastic Four debuted, a vacationing Poppupian traveled to Earth. Hungry from his long trip and naïve to Earth’s rules, he robbed a bank to obtain money to purchase food. The police, Fantastic Four and army proved equally helpless to stop him. Dubbed the Impossible Man after a comment made by the Thing, he went on a fun-seeking rampage, briefly encountering the timeslipping New Warrior Turbo, whom he followed for a while smitten, and helping her teammates against the time-distorting Dr. Yesterday, before returning to his original time. At Reed Richard’s advice, everyone on Earth began ignoring Impossible Man, who soon grew bored, and left.When the Poppupians later grew bored with living, the Impossible Man returned to Earth and, disguised as the Invisible Girl, directed the planet-eater Galactus to Poppup, thus sparing the Earth from being devoured. Galactus ate Poppup, but was stricken with near-terminal indigestion. The only surviving Poppupian, the Impossible Man returned to Earth, where his shapeshifting antics soon caused chaos. He visited the Marvel offices, announcing he wanted his own comic, like the one they did based on the FF. Told that readers had disliked him when he appeared in the adaptation of his first visit to Earth because he looked too silly, he had a temper tantrum which ended only when Reed made Stan Lee promise to do a special issue featuring him. When the cyborg Deathlok was sent to attack the U.S. President, Reed had Impossible Man impersonate him, thus rendering the assault ineffective. Impossible Man stayed at the Fantastic Four's Baxter Building, which was attacked by their enemies the Frightful Four immediately after he arrived. While the Fantastic Four were captured, the Impossible Man was oblivious, having become fascinated by television, but when the channel he was watching finished, Impossible Man thought there was a problem with the power; tapping into the building supply, he unwittingly cut off the power to the Fantastic Four’s restraints, freeing them to defeat their opponents. Impossible Man stayed with the Fantastic Four for a while after, picking up the nickname Impy. When Klaw and the Molecule Man attacked the building, they knocked out Impy, but their subsequent ambush of the Fantastic Four was disrupted when he angrily revived. He proved immune to both villains powers now that he was aware of their attacks, and almost accidentally overpowered Klaw, but when Molecule Man possessed Reed’s body, the Fantastic Four stopped Impy attacking him, afraid he might cause serious injury. Deciding that they were no fun, Impy left, eventually ending up in Hollywood, where he amused himself causing chaos on film sets. Becoming bored, he returned to visit the Fantastic Four, but found only the Thing present. He accompanied him in hat form to Alicia Masters sculpture show, where, witnessing Thing and Alicia’s love for one another while helping defeat the Terrible Trio, Impy was inspired to create an Impossible Woman. Following Reed and Sue Richards’s example, the new Impossible couple created children, soon producing dozens of Impossible kids. Using the Baxter Building facilities to find an uninhabited world to replace Poppup, they departed Earth. Soon after Impy returned seeking his missing spouse, approaching private eye Jessica Drew (Spider-Woman), and lending both aid and hindrance when she tried to apprehend some jewel thieves, before being reunited with his wife. To decide whether who should be in charge of the family, Impy returned to Earth on a Scavenger Hunt, beginning by taking the X-Men’s Mansion. With the mutant team in pursuit, Impy nipped round the globe, collecting Nick Fury’s eyepatch, Ka-Zar’s sabretooth tiger ally Zabu, the Fantasticar, Wasp’s costume collection, the window from Dr. Strange’s Sanctum and the Black Queen (Selene)’s costume. However he failed to collect his last item, Stan Lee, and thus lost the contest. Having enjoyed meeting his new “friends”, Impy soon returned to the X-Men Mansion, finding the New Mutants home instead. When they refused to play, he accused them of cowardice, and his challenge was taken up the team’s own alien shapeshifter, Warlock. Pursued by the other New Mutants, the pair competed round the world with one another to prove who was the better shapeshifter, until Warlock, prompted by his teammates, won by doing the one thing Impy couldn’t – he changed color. After trying to purchase the movie rights to Rick Jones autobiography, Impy ran into the Silver Surfer out in deep space while being pursued by an angry alien armada; despite this threat, Impy was more concerned with making the overly serious Surfer lighten up. He secretly followed the Surfer, watching his subsequent encounter with Thanos. Alarmed to hear Thanos’ plan to kill half the galaxy, in case he was in that half, and fearing the Surfer wouldn’t be able to beat Thanos if he was too serious, the terrified Impossible Man again pestered the Surfer to get a sense of humor. Impossible Woman asked Impy to take her and the 4,682 children on vacation to Earth. They split up to see the sights, and while Impossible Man annoyed Spider-Man, Dr. Strange and the Punisher, Impossible Woman asked Quasar to help convince her non-shapeshifting child Impia to shapechange. The kids decided to set up a clubhouse in Dr. Doom’s armor; swiftly realizing he couldn’t force them out, Doom employed psychology to convince them to move to a new clubhouse, Iron Man's armor. After Impy annoyed Impossible Woman she called a halt to the holiday and the Impossibles set off to the Skrull world Satriani, to show Empress S’Byll their vacation pictures. Impy realized they had misplaced a child, and returned to Earth seeking him, checking the Microverse and Asgard. Meanwhile Impossible Woman visited the Savage Land, pursuing tales of a green shapeshifter, but found only the stranded Samuel J. Skrull, whom she adopted. They finally found their son playing in a rock band, which inspired the whole family to go on an intergalactic singing tour. After starting a riot in a \"Bar With No Name\" by taking on the form of a deck of cards with an extra ace, and watching Makkari win the Galactic Marathon, Impy discovered he had not been invited to Rick Jones wedding. Feeling left out, he sent invitations to others who had been similarly “forgotten”, including Drax the Destroyer, Absorbing Man, Mister Hyde, Living Laser, and the Wizard, Kree and Skrulls. When 3 of his kids became slackers, Impy looked up his old friends the New Mutants, now known as X-Force, wanting to put his children on the team so they could learn discipline. Caving in to persistent nagging, Cable agreed to try, but failed to inspire them to action until the island they were on was attacked by the monstrous Barrachus the Kalinator. Encountering an interdimensional imp he called “Mixed Pickles” in a dimensional interface, he entered into a competition with him; they agreed to combine powers to swap heroes from their respective universes to play with. While Pickles annoyed the Silver Surfer, Impy disguised himself as the Super-Skrull to battle Pickles normal opponent, the last survivor of his destroyed planet. Believing he had won, Impy jumped dimensions to where Mixed Pickles was fighting the Surfer, but was angered to see him endangering innocent bystanders, something he had promised not to do. When Pickles stated he had lied, Impy cheated and tricked the imp bringing both heroes together in one reality, one way of winning the contest.  Eventually the Impossible Kids all left home. Distraught, the Impossible couple created new kids, but they left too. Unable to cope, the pair traveled to Earth and inundated first the Baxter Building and  then New York with Impossible clones, who, because of their progenitor’s darkened moods, had a nastier streak to their humor than their older siblings; 4 of them even tried to kill and replace the Fantastic Four. While the Fantastic Four were distracted containing this problem, the Impossible couple kidnapped Franklin and Valeria Richards, who they felt wouldn’t run away like their own children. The new writer of Marvel’s licensed Fantastic Four comic book, Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, having witnessed the Impossible chaos, researched Impy’s history and figured out the couple were grieving for their own children; The Fantastic Four helped the pair accept that all children eventually leave home, and Reed built a tracking device so they could find them. Impy recently returned to Earth uncontrollably changing form due to hiccups, but the Thing cured him with a fright, after which he was invited to attend his Bar Mitzvah and superhero poker game.  Note: Excalibur once ran into an Impossible Man controlling an insane alternate Earth for his amusement. Given his powers, it’s possible this was Earth-616’s Impy. Mixed Pickles has also impersonated Impy on at least one occasion to torment the Fantastic Four of an undisclosed dimension. If impossible man got smarter he could probably beat anyone.",

      "biography": "A long time ago, the conceptual beings Lord Chaos and Master Order created the In-Betweener and charged him with the task of keeping the cosmos in balance for them. The In-Betweener was then sent out into the cosmos to fulfill its mission first by kidnapping the being Adam Warlock in order to transform him into the Magus, but that planned ultimately failed when Warlock escaped by traveling through time and making the transformation impossible.The In-Betweener later placed himself with a group of sorcerers known as the Creators as he planned to alter the fabric of reality by imposing his own concept of balance on the universe, but was opposed by the sorcerer supreme, Doctor Strange.  The two battled, but the In-Betweener ultimately lost when Doctor Strange alerted his masters to his scheme.Afterwards, the In-Betweener attempted to escape subservience to Lord Chaos and Master Order by allying himself with the Elders of the Universe with the plan to replace Galactus’s role in the universe.  However, Galactus did not agree with this plan and defeated the In-Betweener in battle allowing him to be imprisoned by Chaos and Order.  Later, the mad titan Thanos freed him from his prison only to trick the In-Betweener into surrendering his soul gem to him.  Although free for a while, the In-Betweener was captured by his masters once again.Recently, the would-be world conqueror called Scorpio learned that the last millennium had unraveled \"incorrectly,\" and that the Zodiac Key was needed to ensure the following thousand years would unravel correctly. He then used the Key to steal the capitals of the world, usurp the dimension the In-Betweener made for himself as a place of reflection, and divide the In-Betweener into his order and chaos selves because he needed the raw power of chaos and his realm to further his plans.  The Scarlet Witch had exhibited the characteristics of the In-Betweener when his chaos half tried to contact her because, as she explained to the other Avengers, he wanted to be rejoined with his order half.  The Scarlet Witch then used her magics to locate the order half of the In-Betweener, and the Avengers along with Namor, the Sub-Mariner set out to find him. When confronted, the order half, not wanting to be merged with his other self, sent several of the Avengers to the Ankh Dimension, where they confronted Scorpio.  Namor then attacked the order half on his own and was easily defeated, but just as the order half claimed his victory the mighty Thor returned to Earth and renewed the battle.  Thor was holding his own, but the Scarlet Witch’s patience had run out and she attacked, and forced open a dimensional portal to follow the other Avengers to Scorpio, and the chaos half of the In-Betweener.  The chaos half that was under the control of Scorpio was set free when the villain was defeated, and once it threatened the life of the Avenger, Vision, the Scarlet Witch used her powers to merge the two halves together again.  Now whole, the In-Betweener returned the Avengers and the Earth’s cities and their peoples to their rightful places.  The In-Betweener also commented on how the Avengers were a great power for good, but spoke of an equally powerful evil that would come and many would die possibly warning them of the Scarlet Witch's mental breakdown.  With that, the In-Betweener teleported away and has not been seen since.",

      "biography": "Sue Storm Richards is a formidable heroine with the ability to render herself and others invisible at will. After her genes are mutated, she co-founds Earth’s first team of super heroes, the Fantastic Four and becomes their unifying maternal figure.\n \n\nInvisible Woman\n\nBorn Susan Storm, Sue and her brother Johnny have a happy childhood until their mother Mary dies in a car crash. Their father, celebrated surgeon Dr. Franklin Storm, survives the accident. His spirit broken, Dr. Storm abandons his practice, becoming a gambler and a drunk, and eventually goes to prison after he accidentally kills an underworld loan shark during a struggle. \n\nSue embodies a motherly role towards Johnny thereafter, though both were soon placed in the custody of their loving aunt, Marygay who ran a boardinghouse. While living there, Sue became smitten with her aunt’s handsome and brilliant tenant, science prodigy Reed Richards, then a university student. Though, does not encounter him again until her college years in California when she pursues an acting career.\n\nWhen a sudden funding loss threatens to derail Reed’s experimental starship project, Reed urges his pilot, Ben Grimm, to join him in making an unauthorized test flight before the project is shut down. Grimm’s reluctant, but accepts the challenge after Sue questions his courage. Sue and her brother Johnny insist on coming along as well, wishing to share the risk. The quartet successfully launches into space, but intense cosmic rays penetrate the ship’s shielding and irradiates the crew, forcing them back to Earth. Upon landing, they discover they had mutated into super humans, and Sue became the Invisible Girl. Dedicating their new powers to super-heroics and scientific exploration, the quartet became the Fantastic Four (FF). She later takes the name Invisible Woman after an encounter with Psycho-Man that changes her.\n&nbsp;\n\nInvisibility and Force Field Projection\n\nSue Richards can render herself wholly or partially invisible at will. She can also render other people or objects invisible, affecting up to 40,000 cubic feet of volume. To achieve these feats, she mentally bends all wavelengths of light in the vicinity around herself, or the target in question, without causing any visible distortion effects.\n\nWhile ordinary retinas register objects using reflected light, Sue’s retinas also interpolate shapes based on reflected cosmic rays, which are always present within the atmosphere in minute concentrations. Her extended vision allows her to see invisible people and objects, though not in technicolor since the cosmic-ray reflections bypass her eyes’ rods and cones; her vision may be similarly monochromatic when she herself is invisible since her eyes do not reflect light in that state, though she otherwise seems to possess a full range of vision while she’s invisible. She can detect anything made invisible by means outside her powers, and can restore those targets to a visible state at will. If she wishes, she can render her targets only partially invisible – enabling her, for instance, to expose the inner workings of machinery or the internal organs of living beings.\n\nInvisible Woman can project and manipulate near-indestructible invisible force fields, making her a more effective combatant. She can generate these force fields physically and psionically around herself and other targets; within an object, which she can expand to cause explosions or within a target’s body to render people unconscious or induce more serious physical distress; and vary the texture and tensile strength, rigid for defense and soft for to cushioning impacts. She is also capable of generating and manipulating multiple psionic force fields simultaneously.\n\nFurthermore, she can shape invisible fields into constructs, turning them into offensive weapons as small as a marble or as large as 100 feet in diameter. Her hollow projections, such as domes, can extend up to several miles in area. She can generate more massive force fields large enough to envelop a 20-story building, including the 10 acres of foundation beneath it, or a network of invisible scaffolding strong enough to hold a building as tall as the Empire State Building.\n\nShe is also able to shield her mind from some types of telepathic intrusion or influence, detect and locate nearby people or objects using an invisible force that pulses out from her body as radar, and can track psionic energy sources over great distances or snare and redirect psionic energies active in her general vicinity.\n\nVisible light frequencies mostly pass through her standard force fields unaltered and unimpeded, a condition which sometimes leaves her vulnerable to light-based attacks. She can bend and shape a force field so that it captures ambient light, enabling her to create a makeshift low-intensity torch or flashlight composed of suspended light. This ability extends to bending the sunlight’s invisible ultraviolet rays with a force field an inch before they reach her skin, rendering herself immune to sunburns. Sue once briefly swaps powers with her brother Johnny, and during that time can generate and manipulate flames for various effects.\n\nSue has some experience and ability in the fields of acting and teaching. A capable unarmed combatant and an excellent swimmer, she is fluent in both English and Latverian. Like the rest of the FF, she wears a highly durable costume composed of unstable molecules that shift to accommodate the wearer’s physical form.\n&nbsp;\n\nAdversaries\n\nPsycho-Man and his Hate-Monger android use his emotion-manipulation powers and technology to morph Sue, aka Invisible Girl, into Malice Mistress of Hate, though she is able to overcome the transformation with Reed’s help and uses Psycho-Man’s technology against him. The experience inspires Sue to take the name Invisible Woman.\n\nVictor von Doom, aka Dr. Doom, is the Fantastic Four’s foremost foe. He time and time again goes up against the FF for his own villainous ends, even so far as to use their daughter Valeria as a familiar and attack them. He even disrupts Sue and Reed’s wedding with a major onslaught by manipulating a host of super-criminals, but they always seem to overcome his persistent attacks.\n&nbsp;\n\nEarth’s First Family and Friends\n\nAs a co-founding member of the Fantastic Four, Sue supports the team in protecting Earth and the universe from super villainous threats. Sue often takes an active role in managing the FF’s financial assets through their Fantastic Four, Inc. support company, and even serves as chief creative officer of its Enterprises division, managing the team’s licensing, trademarks and the assorted merchandise and media properties based on the group. Outside of her business-related duties, Sue marries FF co-founding member Reed Richards, aka Mr. Fantastic, is sister to Johnny Storm, aka Human Torch, and friend to Ben Grimm, aka The Thing.\n\nOther affiliations that Sue has includes Friends of Miss America; formerly “Secret Avengers,” Initiative, Avengers, Brides of Set, and Captain of the Girls’ Varsity Swim Team.\n\nThe FF remain staunch allies to the Avengers, even worked as members until they resigned from the group. Regardless of the departure from the team, Sue is friendly with various Avengers members, notably the size-changing socialite Wasp and the super-strong She-Hulk, who had served a lengthy stint with the FF during a period when Ben was estranged from the team.\n\nLike the other FF founders, Sue has participated in many mass superhero gatherings over the years—notably the original Contest of Champions, during which she teamed with Iron Fist and Sunfire as pawns of an unknown entity to battle the Grandmaster’s pawns Daredevil, Darkstar and Australian hero Talisman.\n\nSuper-genius Alyssa Moy is a source of occasional discomfort for Sue. While Moy is a valued ally to the FF over the years, Sue suspects Alyssa retains a lingering romantic interest in Reed, having spurned a proposal of marriage from him during their youth, and is proven correct when a jealous Alyssa makes a play for him but he gently but firmly rejected her as he remains deeply in love with Sue. In the end, Sue makes made peace with Alyssa.\n&nbsp;",

He found nothing more than a hollow victory, but joined a surrogate family of heroes and adventurers whom he would defend to the very end.\n\nA Hero is Born\n\nDanny Rand's life changed forever as a nine-year-old boy.

      "biography": "In the year 3016 on the technologically advanced alternate Earth known as Other-Earth, 16-year-old robotics student Nathaniel Richards was rescued from a life-threatening situation by his future-self the time-traveling despot Kang The Conqueror. Kang, hoping to change a very painful moment in his life, outfitted his younger self with a suit of psychokinetic armor that responded to his thoughts and gave him a glimpse of his future as a conqueror. Horrified at the death and destruction caused by his future-self, young Nathaniel rejected Kang's help and used the armor to escape and hide in the modern day Earth (616 reality), hoping to find the Avengers so they could help him take down Kang. However, once young Nathaniel reached the present day and ventured toward Avengers Mansion looking for help all he found were the ruins left behind from the Disassembled attacks from an insane Scarlet Witch.Calling himself Iron Lad, Nathaniel  attempted to contact some of the individual Avengers but met with no success. Realizing that he couldn't travel further back in time due to a glitch in the armor (or perhaps due to mystical interference from the Scarlet Witch) Nathaniel set out to find help wherever he thought possible. He used his armor to track down the body of the Vision (who had also been destroyed during the Disassembled attacks) at a Stark Enterprises warehouse. Nathaniel then linked his armor to the Vision's body and downloaded all of his programming, including the Avengers protocols, a series of files on the next-wave of young Avengers who were all super-powered youths with either some significance to the Avengers themselves or to Avengers history.Iron Lad used this data to recruit three \"Young Avengers\" who resided in New York City. These three were Elijah \"Eli\" Bradley (the Patriot), William \"Billy\" Kaplan (the Asgardian), and Theodore \"Teddy\" Atlman (Hulkling). Leading the quartet of young heroes on several missions in an attempt to train them in for their impending showdown with Kang. Learning of the existence of the \"Young Avengers\" Captain America and Iron Man set out to stop them before they got themselves hurt. They also attracted the attention of Daily Bugle employees Kat Farrell and Jessica Jones as well as wannabe heroes Cassandra \"Cassie\" Lang (later Stature) and Kate Bishop.After Bishop and Lang joined the quartet they wandered to Avengers Mansion to confront Captain America, Iron Man, and Jessica Jones about their futures as heroes. After being attacked by and defeating an odd version of the Growing Man, Captain America tricked the sextet into a trap, confiscating their weaponry and imprisoning the Young Avengers inside the mansion while he Iron Man and Jones figured out what to do. Then Kang showed up. Kang demanded he be given his younger-self before more damage was inflicted to the time-stream. Escaping from their imprisonment the Young Avengers picked up some weapons and attacked Kang alongside Cap, Iron Man, and Jones. The Young Avengers also figured out how to activate the Vision’s programming inside the Iron Lad armor. During the skirmish Iron Lad stabbed Kang through the back with the sword of the Swordsman. Once Kang was dead, reality began to flip out even further causing the Hulkling to disappear. Deciding that he had to accept his fate, Iron Lad had the remaining Young Avengers open a portal to send him back to the time he left. Iron Lad kissed Cassie Lang goodbye and entered the portal, but left the Iron Lad armor behind. Now the Iron Lad armor has merged with the Vision's programming, creating the new Vision who has since joined the Young Avengers. Whether or not the experiences of Iron Lad as a Young Avenger will affect the memories or behavior of Kang, remain to be seen, but it does appear as if Kang has a vested interest in the activities of the Young Avengers.",

She is a master combatant, assassin, and espionage agent.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nORIGIN\n\nA Russian espionage agent, Iron Maiden (Melina Vostokoff) despised legendary Russian spy-turned-defector the&nbsp;Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff), in whose shadow she lived. Becoming a freelance agent, Vostokoff was one of several — including Black Lotus, “Deadshot” Darrance,&nbsp;N’Kama, Kono Sanada, and Snapdragon — hired to assassinate the Widow. In an en masse assault, Iron Maiden outlasted the others and nearly&nbsp;overpowered the Widow but fled when&nbsp;James Woo&nbsp;arrived with a SHIELD squadron.

      "biography": "Blessed and cursed with extraordinary genius, Tony Stark is the son of inventor and defense contractor Howard Stark, and geneticist &amp; educator Maria Stark. The Starks were developing a biological personal armor coating when a lab accident with a regenerative virus fatally infected Maria. The virus mutated her unborn child, Tony, growing additional neural tissue throughout his body which augmented his intelligence while causing chronic pain. Maria died, but Howard saved Tony by coating him in their bacterial bio-armor, which consumed ordinary skin but not Tony's constantly regenerating neural flesh. Business rival Zebediah Stane married Howard's scheming ex-wife Loni, with whom he stole Stark's company, and spent years trying to seize the bio-armor. As a teenager, Tony befriended fellow prep school student Jim Rhodes and began developing his own \"Iron Man\" armor technology. Becoming a wealthy celebrity and science prodigy, young Tony founded multi-billion dollar design and manufacturing corporation Stark International. He also became an infamous playboy, alcoholic, and womanizer, suffering from recurring depression and secretly learning he was dying from an inoperable brain tumour. When Stark and his shifty cousin Morgan were taken hostage along with other civilians by Guatemalan guerrilla terrorists, their captors demanded Stark's technology in exchange for the hostages' freedom. They killed Morgan when Tony refused to cooperate. Pretending to acquiesce, Stark built makeshift armor and defeated the terrorists with it. Years later, Stark used the new Iron Man armor to save the President from an assassination attempt, becoming a bigger celebrity than ever, but refusing to sell or mass-produce his armor technology. When Latverian ambassador Golog tried to steal Stark's \"Irontech\" with the covert approval of intelligence agency S.H.I.E.L.D., Stark fought off Golog's Mandroids with the aid of Spider-Man. Spurred by his tumor to make the most of whatever time he had left, Stark began doing more charitable good works, relocated to his Manhattan property and agreed to join the Ultimates, a S.H.I.E.L.D.-sponsored superhero team. Forming an unlikely friendship with anti-corporate teammate Thor, Stark helped subdue the monstrous Hulk and save Earth from the extraterrestrial Chitauri. Tony began dating teammate Natasha Romanov (Black Widow) and eventually proposed to her, creating new armor for her as an engagement gift; however, when a traitor within the ranks helped an army of foreign super-soldiers defeat the Ultimates, Natasha was apparently revealed as the traitor when she turned on Tony during the assault. Tony turned the tables on her, using the nanites he had given her to enable her to control her armor against her, paralyzing her and downloading information direct from her brain to his.",

      "biography": "Obadiah Stane was the son of Zebediah Stane, a drunkard who was a failure in making a career for himself. One night, when Obadiah was only a child, his father returned to the hotel room where they were staying, having just won a great deal of money gambling. Apparently overjoyed, the elder Stane told Obadiah that his luck had changed, and to prove it, Zebediah played Russian roulette with himself, loading a single bullet into a gun, spinning the chamber, and then firing the gun at his head. The elder Stane thus killed himself with his first shot, traumatizing young Obadiah. Later, Obadiah decided that his father had realized that the world was his opponent against which he could not succeed, and had therefore intentionally committed suicide. Now orphaned, Stane was raised in a succession of foster homes. By his eighth birthday, Obadiah Stane was completely bald as a result of the shock of witnessing his father's death. Ridiculed by his classmates for his baldness, Obadiah became introverted. He became fascinated by games of chance, especially chess. Obadiah believed that life was itself a game at which his father had lost, Obadiah determined that he himself would never lose at anything.One of Stane's fellow students at his school, Bernie Devlin, was a better chess player than he. Devlin bested Stane in the penultimate match of a school chess tournament. The winner of the next game would win the tournament. Stane secretly slit the throat of Devlin's beloved dog, Ruffer, and hid the dog's corpse in Devlin's school locker. After finding Ruffer's body on the day of the final game. Devlin was so distraught that Stane easily won the tournament. This episode was the first major example of Stane's use of psychological warfare in order to get what he wished: Stane would discover his opponent's weakness and then exploit it. Stane became an international chess champion while in his teens.In his early twenties Stane worked for an industrialist whom he came to regard as an incompetent. Perceiving that the industrialist's primary weakness was his love for his young wife Stane faked photographs showing the wife apparently engaged in an affair with the industrialist's best friend. The industrialist's morale was thereby destroyed, and Stane soon took control of the company himself. This was the beginning of Stane's accumulation of a massive fortune: he made his first million dollars by the age of twenty five. Stane began selling munitions made by his company to whatever buyers offered the best prices for them, often to repressive dictatorships. Eventually, Stane built his company into a multinational corporation producing munitions that was based in Salt Lake City, Utah, with offices in various locations in the United States and abroad.Stane decided to create a team of special bodyguards for himself, the Chessmen, whose costumes and identities derived from Stane's love of chess.Stane attempted to form an organization of European and Oriental industrialists, led by himself, that would act in defiance of antitrust laws, and even attempt to usurp power from the leaders of certain nations. Anthony Stark, the president and chairman of the board of Stark International, a leading American-based electronics and manufacturing corporation, opposed Stane's efforts to form such an organization. Stane had been seeking a worthy opponent against whom to compete in a new \"game\" of business maneuvers, and decided that Stark was the man he sought. Stane also knew Stark's principal weakness: Stark was a reformed alcoholic. At this point Stane had not yet realized that Anthony Stark was secretly the costumed champion Iron Man.First, Stane employed an agent codenamed Tattoo to bring about widespread sabotage at Stark International's Long Island headquarters. Iron Man thwarted Tattoo,but the latter died, having secretly been poisoned by Stane. Another of Stane's secret agents, a woman named Indries Moomji, encountered Stark and encouraged him to fall in love with her over the following weeks.During this time, Iron Man battled various members of the Chessmen. One of the latter, a Rook, held Stark's best friend, James Rhodes, captured and poisoned by venomous spiders. Iron Man defeated the various Chessmen and rescued Rhodes, but Rhodes had to be hospitalized. Iron Man learned that Stane was behind these various actions against him and his company, and confronted Stane, but with no success. By now Stane's alliance of foreign corporations had succeeded in outbidding Stark International for certain major foreign contracts. Then men working for Stane attempted to abduct or kill Rhodes from his hospital bed; Rhodes escaped, but Stark did not know what had happened to him. Stark met with Stane, who arrogantly defied him. Terribly depressed and near despair, Stark met with Indries Moomji, who coldly and cruelly rejected him and his love for her, just as she and Stane had intended. For Stark this was the final blow: he began drinking alcohol heavily again, and quickly began his downward slide psychologically as a result.Due to various recent financial setbacks, Stark international had a number of large debts. Stane bought up all the company's debts and also initiated a number of civil suits of an unrevealed nature against the company. Stark himself no longer even tried to fight against Stane's obvious takeover attempt and instead sought solace in drunkenness. As a result, Stane succeeded in taking control of Stark international and becoming its new president and chairman of the board, displacing Stark in both roles. Stane renamed the corporation Stane International and banned Stark from the premises.A number of Stark International employees who were loyal to Stark and opposed Stane's takeover soon resigned, including Rhodes, Yvette Avril, and executive secretary Bambi Arbogast. Rhodes had already taken over the role of Iron Man from the now continually drunken Stark, and saw to it that Stark's other Iron Man armored suits were destroyed so that neither Stane nor the international law enforcement agency SHIELD could make use of them. Stark had previously manufactured munitions for SHIELD, but had finally ended munitions production altogether. Stane had quickly resumed weapons contracts with SHIELD upon his takeover, and it has been speculated that Stane had had SHIELD's support all along in his effort to seize control of Stark International.Stane arranged for a court order freezing Stark's financial assets, effectively rendering him penniless. Eventually, Stane formed an alliance with Stark's enemy and former lover Madame Masque, who had resumed control of her \"family\" in the criminal Maggia.After spending many months as a drunken derelict, Anthony Stark finally resolved to stop drinking after he delivered the baby of his friend, a fellow derelict named Gretl Anders during a snowstorm. Gretl died in giving birth, and in trying to keep the infant alive amidst the bitter cold, Stark was reawakened to the importance of life. Stark and the baby were both taken to a hospital. Rhodes went there as Iron Man to see Stark, who told him of his desire to rebuild his life. Shortly afterward, Stark, once again having overcome his alcoholism, joined Rhodes and the siblings Morley and Clytemnestra Erwin in founding Circuits Maximus, a new California-based electronics firm. Soon afterwards Stark brought about the defeat of the Termite, a superhuman criminal who had been hired by Stane to sabotage Fetison Electronics.Stane was still convinced that Stark was a hopeless drunkard and was unaware of Stark's return to constructive activity, or even of his defeat of the Termite. Then, however, Stane learned that Stark was being sought by the latter's former lover Bethany Cabe. Intrigued as to why she was looking for him, Stane had Cabe captured.By now Stane and Madame Masque were on the verge of becoming lovers. Moreover, Stane had correctly guessed by now that Anthony Stark had been the original Iron Man. Stane speculated that the Iron Man who had been active since Stark had become a derelict was either Rhodes or one of the Erwin siblings. Stane was not aware that recently Stark had reluctantly gone into action as Iron Man on a few occasions himself. Madame Masque warned Stane that her informants had told her that Stark had given up drinking and was active again.Seeking to destroy the new Iron Man, Stane dispatched the Circuits Breaker, a device with which he intended to kill Rhodes and the Erwins. Both garbed in Iron Man armor, Stark and Rhodes went into action against it, and Rhodes destroyed the weapon. Stane then realized that one of the two Iron Men who had attacked the Circuits Breaker must have been Stark.For reasons that remain unclear, Stane had his employee, Dr. Theron Atlanta, exchange the consciousnesses of Cabe and Madame Masque. Then, as part of his new plot to destroy Stark, Stane had Stark's friends Virginia \"Pepper\" Potts Hogan and Bambi Arbogast abducted, and even had Gretl's infant son Timothy Anders kidnapped. Rhodes, as Iron Man, thwarted the first attempt to abduct another of Stark's friends, Harold \"Happy\" Hogan. In retaliation, Stane tried to destroy Iron Man by sending a bomb to Circuits Maximus headquarters. It exploded, killing Morley Erwin and injuring Rhodes, and Stane's men succeeded in their second attempt to abduct \"Happy\" Hogan.Stark blamed himself for not having stopped Stane before the latter had killed Erwin and had the others kidnapped. Determined to stop Stane now, Stark decided to return to his life as Iron Man, wearing a new, improved suit of armor he had recently designed. After Stane had taken over Stark International, a notebook of Stark's had been found there with cryptic notes about the workings and construction of Iron Man's armor. Stane set a team of scientists to work to build a battlesuit called the Iron Monger based on these notes. Stane intended to mass produce the suits, perhaps to outfit his own army and take over one or more nations.On learning that Iron Man had invaded Stane International's Long Island headquarters, Stane realized this Iron Man was indeed Stark, and dispatched a Circuits Breaker and a team of Chessmen against him. After Iron Man easily overcame these threats, Stane donned the Iron Monger armor and went into battle against Iron Man himself. As Iron Monger, Stane failed to defeat Iron Man, so he finally resorted to the ploy of seizing the Anders infant and threatening to kill him unless Iron Man surrendered. Realizing that the Iron Monger armor was controlled by a computer in a nearby building, Iron Man destroyed the unoccupied building, causing the Iron Monger suit to become immobile. Stane dropped the baby, whom Iron Man caught and brought to safety. Stane gained some control over the armor, but not enough to avoid a crash landing.Defeated, Stane committed suicide by removing his helmet and firing a repulsor ray blast from his armor at his own head. Stark, as Iron Man, was the only person to witness Stane's death, and Stane's security personnel quickly removed the body from the scene.Stark, as Iron Man, had already freed the Hogans and Mrs. Arbogast before Stane's death. Shortly after Stane's death Cabe and Madame Masque regained their rightful bodies. Stark regained control of his personal fortune, and decided to make no attempt to regain the presidency and chairmanship of the board of Stane International. Instead, Stark founded a new firm, Stark Enterprises, based in California. The Iron Monger armor somehow fell into the possession of industrialist Simon Steele, who sent an employee of his wearing the armor to kill the former adventurer Dominic Fortune. Stark, as Iron Man, defeated the Iron Monger, and the current whereabouts of the Iron Monger armor have not been revealed.Stane's death was never reported in the news media. Only Stark, a few of Stark's associates, Stane's security personnel, and top-ranking SHIELD officials are aware of it. Following his death, Stane was replaced with a lifelike LMD by the Deltite, a rogue android which had been manipulating SHIELD. Through the LMD of Stane, the Deltite was able to maintain SHIELD's interest in Stane International. The LMD was presumably destroyed. Stane International was later acquired by another of Stark's business rivals, Justin Hammer, but the property was eventually reacquired by Stark himself. Most of the corporation's assets were either absorbed into Stark's then-company Stark Enterprises or closed down.",

      "biography": "Jack and his brother Drake were active members of Stars and Stripes, the citizen’s action portion of Captain America’s Hotline.  After Drake became disabled, Jack underwent a physical training regimen, learning several martial arts.  When the Serpent Society cheaply bought out the residents of the Sandhaven Acres retirement community after a fraudulent toxic land scare, Jack began investigating.  Armed with a “combat boom box” designed by Drake, nineteen year old Jack fashioned a flag-themed costume and intervened when Rock Python and Fer-de-Lance robbed a small bank.  Jack, hoping to infiltrate the Society, told King Cobra he wanted to join the group.  Cobra, distrusting Jack, sent him to steal from the Reno headquarters of his sometime partner, Mr. Hyde, but also warned Hyde about Jack. Hyde severely beat Flag, who was drenched in Hyde’s chemicals during the fight and developed superhuman strength.  Briefly felling Hyde with a desperate blow, Flag contacted Captain America’s hotline and returned to Sandhaven to present Cobra with his stolen loot.  Impressed, Cobra tried out Jack in his own King Cobra suit.  Captain America soon arrived and Jack allied with him and his protégé, Free Spirit; while the Captain fought Cobra and Mr. Hyde, Jack and Free Spirit defeated the Serpent Society with help from Force Works. Jack followed Captain America and Free Spirit east, aiding them against ULTIMATUM,  A.I.M., and Madcap.  When Captain America believed himself to be dying, he charged Jack, Spirit, Fabian Stankowicz, and Zach Moonhunter with maintaining the Hotline for him. However, Jack retired his Jack Flag costume after the dissolution of the Hotline. Recently during the Civil War he donned the costume again to protect civilians from local gangsters and denounced the Registration Act. He was then hunted down by the newly reformed Thunderbolts, a legalized superhero team of former villains. Though fighting valiantly, Jack was paralyzed by Bullseye as he tried to escape through a building and was promptly arrested following the incident. He was thrown into the Negative Zone prison, but during an attack by Blastaar and his minions Jack was rescued by the Guardians of the Galaxy. He underwent surgery to repair his legs, and even though Jack professed to hating everything cosmic he remained with the Guardians as an active member of the group.",

      "biography": "Early history of Steven Levins isn't known until he somehow got his hands on Jason Macendale's Jack O'Lantern equipment. His first known appearance was when he and Blackwing were searching for Red Skull in his old hideout after he had faked his death. They didn't know that they weren't alone and got attacked by Captain America who had come to check the place. Captain America managed to surprise them and attacked Levins. They fought until Levins managed to use a gas grenade that contained hallucinogenic gases on him. Captain America was caught in an illusion, but still managed to hold both villains at bay. When the two villains realized that they couldn't beat him they tried to escape through the sewers, but Captain America managed to capture them after the effects of the hallucinogenic gases wore off. When he was taking them to a secure place to question them they were both shot by a guy that looked like Scourge of the Underworld. Captain America left after him thinking that the two villains had died, but it was a illusion made by Mother Night who had taken the appearance of Scourge of the Underworld and Cutthroat retrieved both bodies while she distracted Captain America. They didn't count on Mother Night being captured and taken to a police station by Captain America. Jack O'Lantern and Blackwing decided to join the Skeleton Crew, but were reluctant to go save Mother Night from the police station. Mother Night managed to get herself out of jail by paying her own bail and they left to the Red Skull's new base in Colorado. The Red Skull provided Levins and Blackwing upgraded versions of their weapons and equipment.He worked for the Red Skull until Captain America and Falcon came to rescue Diamondback who was kidnapped by Crossbones. They fought for a while Falcon took care of Jack O'Lantern and Blackwing and Captain America took down Crossbones and Mother Night with the help of Diamondback. Jack O'Lantern and the other villains were imprisoned in the Vault.After he managed to escape from prison. He was seen in the auction of bodies of deceased superheroes held by Chess Set. The auction was interrupted when Alpha Flight and Spider-Man crashed the party and Levins quietly slip away in the confusion. He later fought a different Spider-Man, Spider-Man's clone Ben Reilly. He teamed with Beetle, Boomerang, Scorpia and Shocker to get the prize money offered for a skeleton wearing a Spider-Man outfit that Ben Reilly had found in a smokestack. Reilly managed to take them all out and decided to give the skeleton away to get them off his back.Some time later he was hired with Shocker and Constrictor by Dennis Golembuski a crimelord who mainly focused on diamond smuggling. They ran into a problem when young low-level criminal the Hood stole some of the diamonds and even managed to beat the trio. Golembuski wasn't pleased and sent Madam Rapier with them to retrieve the diamonds. She ordered them to stay back till she gave the signal, but things didn't go like she had planned. Trio saw this, but decided not to intervene. Hood outfitted her with a red hood and federal agents though that she was The Hood and shot her. Trio was quite surprised what had happened and even more surprised when Hood gave them the diamonds back. They took the diamonds back to devastated Golembuski fulfilling their contract with him. After this Levins has seen working with Constrictor and Armadillo fighting heroes like Spider-Man and Hercules, but with little success.He resurfaced just before the Civil War|Stamford incident. He was hired by the  terrorist organization R.A.I.D. that had organized terrorist attacks on several targets in London. He, Jackhammer and Shockwave were ordered to flood the Thames Tunnel, but their plans were foiled by Union Jack's intervention. All the villains were arrested and Jack O'Lantern was most likely deported back to U.S.A.. He then was convicted and jailed until Songbird recruited him to a special branch of Thunderbolts. This branch has since been put into action in order to hunt down the heroes of the Anti-Registration resistance. It was while tracking down Spider-Man with the help of Jester that Jack O'Lantern was killed by the Punisher.Levins' body was transported to his hometown Sleepy Hollow to be buried but shortly after his burial a fragment of Lucifer's soul, who Ghost Rider accidentally freed from hell, possessed his corpse. Posing as Jack O'Lantern, Lucifer wrecked havoc in the small town of Sleepy Hollow, slaying Levins' father in the process. Ghost Rider managed to stop him with the help of local Sheriff.",

Later, Jamie was also peripherally involved in Brian's battles with the Red Skull, Lord Hawk and Slaymaster; however, after Brian went overseas and Betsy's modelling career took off, Jamie lost touch with both of them.Addicted to his racing career's rich lifestyle, Jamie took a bribe from the criminal Maggia organization to lose a race, then won anyway. To repay them he took illegal jobs, using his racing as cover to travel the world; minor crimes became increasingly lucrative and immoral ones, until he was trading in human lives. Jamie was eventually captured by Joshua N'Dingi (Dr. Crocodile); learning from Crocodile of Jamie's activities, Brian left him to his fate. Trying to mystically cure Jamie's evil nature, Crocodile's Witch Woman instead unlocked his latent mutant powers, but the magic which held him also bound these. Dimensionally displaced despot Sat-Yr-9 hired the Technet to free Jamie, knowing her reality's version of him possessed powers; left insane by his torture and believing he was living in a dream without consequences, Jamie entered her service. He helped Sat-Yr-9 take over the crimelord Vixen's organization, and targeted his brother's team Excalibur, empowering an otherworldly counterpart of his to battle them. He later clashed with Alfie O'Meagan, an other-dimensional reality warper, which briefly put him off playing with alternate Earths.Eventually, Sat-Yr-9 ambushed Excalibur and Betsy, now the X-Man Psylocke, in Braddock Manor. Jamie slew their ally Alysande Stuart, and then tortured the captives for hours before Meggan broke free and attacked him, breaking his concentration. Psylocke rendered Jamie comatose with her psychic knife. Sat-Yr-9's troops fled, taking Jamie with them, though his unconscious form somehow ended up at Excalibur's Muir Island base, where his siblings attempted to reach him telepathically.Recently, Jamie appears to have awoken. Marvel Girl (Rachel Grey) and Psylocke have caught glimpses of him, and he prevented Saturnyne (a counterpart of Sat-Yr-9) from destroying Earth-616 (his home reality). He seems to be manipulating events, possibly in connection with the recent reappearance of another reality warper, Mad Jim Jaspers, an old foe of Brian's; but his true motivations remain unrevealed.",

Jean's parents knew something was wrong with their daughter and, with no place else to turn, contacted Magneto. Magneto, who had recently announced his intentions to train mutants in the use of their powers, arrived and took Jean into his care.As the X-Men came together, Jean remained their lone telepath.  Due to a lack of telepathic teachers Jean was unable to block out many of her teammates' pains and wants. The man whose pain came through to her most glaringly was the mysterious Weapon X. She felt for Logan and these feelings eventually became love.During a mission, Jean was captured by Prelate Scott Summers. In the months that she was held prisoner it became clear to Apocalypse's Horseman, Sinister, that Jean was an Alpha Class mutant. Sinister would eventually take Jean's DNA, combine it with Scott's, and create Nate Grey, a mutant powerful enough to challenge Apocalypse himself. Soon after that, Weapon X, without the rest of the X-Men, stormed the Breeding Pens and freed Jean. Weapon X and Prelate Summers faced off. Logan lost a hand and Scott lost an eye.Jean and Weapon X did not rejoin the X-Men but instead fought Apocalypse's forces in Europe. Surprisingly, Sinister informed them of Apocalypse's plan to destroy Europe. They took this information to the Human High Council. Weapon X and Jean were asked to destroy Apocalypse's Atlantic Sea Wall so the Council could send Sentinels to evacuate North America before their planned nuclear strike.Although Jean knew it was necessary to take out Apocalypse, she left Logan for America to warn all she could of the impending nuclear strike. Once in America, Jean was able to sneak into Apocalypse's kingdom in New York City. She was eventually captured by Prelate Alex Summers. Alex also took his brother, Prelate Scott Summers, captive because he believed he was in league with Jean. Alex took them to the Dark Beast and told him to use Jean and Scott for genetic fodder. Jean and Scott were able to escape. During the chaos of the battle between the X-Men and Apocalypse's forces, they freed prisoners from the pens. Realizing the nuclear warheads from Europe were on their way, Jean created a telekinetic shield in the sky. While Jean was concentrating on the shield she was killed by a plasma blast fired by Alex Summers. Whether or not she would have been able to stop the nuclear warheads is unknown but this seems irrelevant considering something obviously happened to prevent the annihilation of America. Later it was revealed that she was revived by Sinister, without remembering her old life.",

Once on a family road trip, Jessica’s father accidentally veered into an oncoming military truck, causing a canister of experimental material to crash through their car windshield and into Jessica’s lap.Her mother, father, and younger brother died in the accident, and she sustained injuries that left her in a coma for months.

      "biography": "Joanna Cargill started off as a mercenary known as \"Frenzy.\"  During a mission, Frenzy came head-to-head with the mutant Gambit, and she developed a love-hate relationship with him. She soon joined forces with three other individuals and formed the Alliance of Evil under Apocalypse's leadership. She stayed with the group and served in several missions, putting her up against the mutant group X-Factor. Her first order from Apocalypse was to capture Rusty Collins and recruit him into their group. Her plan was foiled by X-Factor, and after a heated battle, she fled from feeling overwhelmed. Using a mutant with the ability to enhance others' powers, Frenzy's strength and durability made her a difficult foe for the super-heroes, but she was eventually defeated after the death of her power-heightening accomplice. Frenzy's first appearance Later, Frenzy was given an invitation to join the S. S. Superia, a cruise ship owned by the villainess Superia. There, Frenzy served alongside the Femizons, a group of super-powered female criminals, and battled Captain America and Paladin. She also broke free from the Vault, a prison for super villains, and created a ruckus with the Avengers.Frenzy eventually found acceptance under Magneto's teachings. She joined the ranks of the second incarnation of the Acolytes, and participated in several missions, relinquishing the codename Frenzy and preferring to be called by her last name, Cargill. Their first mission was to kidnap a child from a school called Our Mother of the Sacred Heart. Cargill killed Sharon Friedlander, and with her teammates, Unuscione and the Kleinstock Brothers, battled the gold X-Men team. Cargill immediately chased after Gambit, but was knocked out when Gambit hit her with a charged tire. She retreated, but during their next encounter with the X-Men, she battled Iceman. Although they have both changed from the X-Factor days, Cargill pummeled him until he gained enough power to defeat her with his new ice form.After Magneto was revealed to be alive, Cargill was among the Acolytes who quickly turned on Fabian Cortez and joined Magneto in his mutant sanctuary, Avalon. While on a mission to recruit mutants into their cause, Cargill, along with Milan and Unuscione, found the young, meek boy Neophyte, after his betrayal of the Acolytes, Cargill was quick to vote guilty at his trial. During the Fall of Avalon, Cargill allied herself with long-time enemy Cyclops in order for survival, and she and her fellow Acolytes were able to escape the destroyed space station in time. They crash landed in Australia but were given to the authorities.\n \n Cargill as an X-Man The Acolytes escaped prison and found the remains of Avalon, worshiping it and the return of Magneto. Exodus eventually took over leadership of the Acolytes, and Cargill participated in the attack on Mt. Wundagore, the High Evolutionary's base of operations. After the Acolytes disbanded, Cargill became ambassador for Genosha and served as Magneto's right hand woman. She ordered that every country pledge loyalty to Magneto in order to be given some autonomy. She was eventually captured by the government in attempt to find out more of Magneto's plans, but Cargill refused to speak.The meeting in Washington DC was cut short, as Jean Grey entered and freed Cargill, giving her the option of joining Jean's new interim X-Men the easy way or the hard way. Cargill would not turn against her savior, so Jean used her powers to mind-control her into helping them. As a member of the X-Men, Cargill's personality was altered into a campy, awkward woman, far different from her confident, headstrong nature. Cargill's knowledge of Genosha helped the X-Men find Magneto's base. The inexperienced X-Men attacked but were quickly defeated. Cargill was used against her will to battle Magneto, but she was ultimately constrained with a metal pillar. After Magneto's defeat, Cargill was freed from her mind-control, where she immediately left the X-Mansion. It is unknown of she returned to Genosha or where her life has led her. She is also one of the few mutants left after House of M|M-Day. \nRecently, Exodus reformed the Acolytes and Cargill rejoined the team.",

      "biography": "Born the daughter of prosperous Chinese immigrants, young Jubilation \"Jubilee\" Lee was sent to an exclusive Beverly Hills school, where her talent for gymnastics was discovered. Jubilee spent much of her time rollerblading with friends at the local mall, but ultimately ran afoul of mall security. Facing juvenile detention if caught, Jubilee panicked and first manifested her mutant ability to generate explosive energy. Soon after, her parents were mistakenly killed by hitmen. Jubilee fled to the only home she had left - the mall. She survived as a petty thief and street performer, but mall security eventually tired of her eluding capture and called in a team of novice mutant hunters, the M-Squad. That same day, the mall was visited by the female members of the X-Men. When the M-Squad attacked Jubilee, the X-Men came to her aid and then left via a portal created by Gateway. Intrigued, Jubilee followed them through and arrived at the X-Men's base in outback Australia. She lived in the tunnels beneath the town until the X-Men disbanded, after which their former member Wolverine returned to the town and was ambushed by the cyborg Reavers, who crucified him. Jubilee helped him to escape and stayed by his side while he recovered from his ordeal, forming a close bond. After rescuing another former X-Man, Psylocke, from the Mandarin's control in Madripoor, the trio traveled to Genosha to aid in opposing Cameron Hodge. Jubilee accompanied them back to the U.S., where she joined a reformed X-Men. Eventually, Jubilee learned the truth about her parents' deaths and managed to exact revenge on the assassins, though she stopped short of killing them.Jubilee then joined the Generation X training team that was formed by Professor Xavier. As one of the founding members, Jubilee learned to further control her explosive powers and improve upon her field leadership skills.  During her stay with Generation X, Jubilee managed to aid her teammates in battles against Emplate, Sentinels, and the Juggernaut, among others.  During Operation: Zero Tolerance, Bastion captured Jubilation Lee in order to get information on the X-Men.  She resisted his mental probes for a considerable amount of time and also made a few escape attempts.  After triggering a switch that freed the captured X-Men, she befriended Bastion's assistant, Daria, who helped her escape successfully.  Jubilee was then confronted by a Prime Sentinel in the desert,  but defeated it with the help of Wolverine who tracked her scent.  She stayed with the X-Men for a brief stint, and then returned to her Generation X teammates.  While training at the Massachusetts Academy, Jubilee discovered that Hunter Brawn was behind the death of her parents.  Outraged, she took justice into her own hands and ended up throwing him in jail. After Generation X disbanded, Jubilee returned home to try an acting career, which was ultimately short-lived due to an unscrupulous agent exploiting her. Jubilee then briefly joined her former headmaster Banshee's paramilitary X-Corps. After that team was dissolved, Jubilee was one of several mutants captured by the mutant-hating Church of Humanity, who crucified them on the grounds of the Xavier Institute. Jubilee was one of the few to survive, thanks to the X-Man Archangel's newfound healing ability, and she rejoined the X-Men, adventuring with them against the threat of Nightcrawler's father, Azazel.When Cyclops and Emma Frost took on the shared duty of headmaster of the Institute, the X-Men were restructured into three teams, and Jubilee was taken off the active roster. She went home to live with her Aunt Hope and returned to school, becoming a student counselor before being caught up in her Aunt's secret life as a spy. Soon after, Jubilee returned to the Institute.\n\nJubilee was depowered due to the events of House of M|\"M-Day\".  Shortly afterwards, she was interviewed by Sally Floyd as part of her Ex Mutant Diary series. She then got a job working at a half-way house of sorts for fellow depowered mutants.  While at her stay working at the clinic, Wolverine bumped into her. In a matter of seconds, Omega Red broke into the facility and took Jubilee as a hostage.  She was gravely wounded when the building she was held in exploded, as a steel beam fell into her abdomen.  Without hesitation, Logan surrendered himself over to S.H.I.E.L.D. custody as a bargain with them to save her life. \nJubilee has been under the new codename of Wondra, acting as the field leader for the renegade New Warriors that are opposed to hero registration.  Even though she lost her mutant powers, Jubilation Lee brandishes gauntlets on her arms that give her incredible superhuman strength, as well as tech devices that give her flight and limited invulnerability.  It is unknown why she chose this as her primary power set, but it has been stated that she is the team's strongest member.  Directly under Night Thrasher, although at times against his actions and opinions, Jubilee commands her fellow teammates with a serious yet compassionate tone.  Since joining the group, she has used her newfound tech powers and leadership skills to help the team overcome various wanted criminals and even an invasion of Skrulls.  During a raid on a group of wanted criminals known as the Dread Dealers, the New Warriors were thwarted by a group of officers under direct orders from Tony Stark.  Their mission was to force the New Warriors to either give up their superheroics peacefully or through arrest.  After the death of two of Jubilee's teammates during the confrontation, she reluctantly followed Night Thrasher and her surviving allies into a dystopian future through time travel.  Police Detective Beverly Sykes also managed to travel with them through time, in order to place them under arrest.  Jubilee, her teammates, and Detective Sykes joined forces with an alternate future version of Tony Stark, to stop an alternate Night Thrasher from keeping that world's heroes in the nth dimension. Upon their arrival back to the present, Jubilee and her fellow New Warriors disbanded the team. Night Thrasher allowed each team member to keep their power suits as not only a token of his appreciation, but also in case they would one day need to individually call upon their tech-enhanced abilities.\nAfter her stint as Wondra of the New Warriors, Jubilee continued to assist de-powered mutants by means of a clinic. During this time, several ex-mutants were either kidnapped or killed by a mysterious threat. With the help of her long-time friend Wolverine, Jubilee located and brought the group of criminals to justice... freeing the still-captive former mutants. Jubilee also briefly visited the outskirts of Utopia, in which she talked with a group of young X-Men.\nUpon a second visit near Utopia, Jubilee met up with Pixie of the X-Men. Their afternoon in the sun was put to a halt when a suicidal vampire blew himself up, splattering and infecting Jubilee and several nearby citizens with a vampire virus. Despite her strong will, the young Jubilee could not resist, and sought out those that infected her. She was soon after fully transformed into an undead vampire.",

      "biography": "Cain Marko’s mother died when he was very young, leaving him to live a life of psychological and physical torment at the hands of his abusive father, atomic researcher Doctor Kurt Marko. Following the death of his colleague Doctor Brian Xavier, Kurt married Xavier's widow Sharon and he and Cain took up residence in the Xavier's Westchester mansion with Sharon and her young son, Charles.\n\nKurt seemingly preferred Charles to his own son, which consumed Cain with jealousy and he took to bullying his stepbrother. Cain's father continued to beat him, but Cain did not suffer the abuse alone. Inexperienced at the use of his emerging mutant telepathic powers, Charles shared the pain and inadvertently learned of Cain's jealousy towards him. This only ensured that Cain would forever hate Charles for his unwitting betrayal.\n\nAfter an argument with his father, Cain accidentally caused a fire to engulf his father's home laboratory. Kurt saved Charles first, and then went back for Cain, reinforcing Cain's belief that his father loved Charles more than he. Kurt died of smoke inhalation, but not before warning Charles to always beware of Cain.\n\nSoon after, both Cain and Charles were drafted into military service and served in same unit. When Cain deserted under fire during a mission in Asia, Charles pursued, hoping to convince his stepbrother to return of his own accord. Charles followed Cain into a cave that housed the lost temple of Cyttorak, a powerful mystical entity. Therein, Cain unearthed the Crimson Gem of Cyttorak and, upon touching it, was transformed by its mystical energies into a human juggernaut. A subsequent cave-in buried Cain, and Charles believed his stepbrother dead.\n\nCain eventually dug himself free and made his way to America where he sought to use his newfound strength to exact revenge on Charles. However, he was defeated on every attempt by the X-Men, a team of mutant adventurers fighting to preserve Charles’ dream of peaceful coexistence between humans and mutants. Cain then formed a criminal partnership with the mutant mercenary Black Tom Cassidy, and the pair soon became two of the world’s most wanted criminals.\n\nAfter many years of villainy, Cain was teleported to an alternate universe where he helped form the team of costumed adventurers known as the eXiles. Cain was eventually returned to his own universe, whereupon he encountered the psionic being known as Onslaught who used his enormous powers to physically hurl Cain from Canada to New York. There, he encountered the X-Men once more and was taken to Charles’ mansion for medical treatment. On waking, Cain sought out Charles to warn him of Onslaught. To his horror, Cain discovered that Onslaught was Charles who tore the Ruby of Cyttorak from Cain’s chest and trapped him within it. Therein, Cain discovered an entire plane of existence and encountered a corrupt aspect of Cyttorak. The mystic named Gomurr the Ancient sought to help free Cain from the jewel, imbuing him with the gem's power. Using his newfound strength, Cain destroyed the aspect and was freed from the gem, returning with more power than ever before. Ignoring Gomurr's warning that he was fated to destroy everything and everyone in his path, Cain returned to his villainous ways.\n\nSoon after, Cain heard a rumor of a second Cyttorak Gem, and, coveting its power, he returned to the Temple where he found the first. However, it was a trap set by a Cult who sought the power of the Ruby for themselves, draining Cain's power to energize their Ruby. With the assistance of Black Tom and the X-Men, Cain claimed the power of the second Ruby, but it was possessed by an evil spirit which took over his body. The spirit made Cain smash through dimensional walls in an attempt to destroy its nemesis, but the natives of the other dimension ultimately freed Cain from its possession.\n\nCain eventually discovered that his becoming the Juggernaut was no accident. He had been compelled to enter the temple of Cyttorak, who was one of a pantheon of eight gods that each had an avatar on Earth. These avatars, named the Exemplars, enlisted Cain’s aid in constructing a machine that would remove humanity's free will, thus allowing their gods to rule the Earth. With Charles’ help, Cain regained control of his psyche and foiled the Exemplars’ plan.\n\nCain was again cast as a hero when the sentient spaceship Prosh&nbsp;returned to Earth to gather a group of costumed adventurers for a journey through time to uncover the keys to preserving human evolution. Whilst in the past, Cain was shown that despite all his yearning for power, he had squandered his mystical abilities. When the team reassembled in the present, they fought and defeated the alien entity named the&nbsp;Stranger&nbsp;who sought to control the natural evolution of mankind.\n\nSoon after, Cain was drafted into the service of the Commission for Superhuman Activities as a super-powered bounty hunter. However, this new career was short-lived, and Cain eventually found himself working alongside Black Tom once more. Soon after, Cain requested the X-Men's help in stopping Tom, whose plant-based powers had resurfaced and flared out of control. After a brief clash with the X-Men, it came to light that Cain had been stripped of Cyttorak's mystical energies and was no longer invulnerable. Tom was defeated, but not before he knocked Cain into the surrounding waters. A young aquatic mutant named Samuel Pare saved Cain's life, forming a strong bond of friendship between the unlikely pair. When Cain was invited by his stepbrother to take up residence at the mansion, he accepted and soon came to appreciate his newfound lot in life. After assisting the X-Men on a mission, Cain joined the team.\n\nAfter Sammy was returned home to Canada, Cain defied a restraining order to visit the boy. When he learned that Sammy’s father was physically abusing him, he flew into a rage and accidentally injured Sammy’s mother.&nbsp;Alpha Flight&nbsp;arrived to defuse the situation and, on seeing a terrified young Samuel, Cain surrendered himself and was taken into custody. Incarcerated in a holding facility designed to contain superhuman criminals, Cain was appointed a lawyer in the form of Jennifer Walters, the She-Hulk. Whilst Charles discussed a plan of legal action with Walters, another of the facility's inmates - the Rhino - broke free, setting Cain loose in the process. Rather than escape, Cain stayed and defeated the Rhino in order to save the life of a guard. This heroic act, combined with the Canadian government's less than ideal incarceration methods, was enough to make a case for Cain and endear him to Walters.\n\nSoon after, Cain and Walters began a romantic relationship that was cut short by the arrival of Cyttorak's new avatar. With Walters’ aid, Cain defeated the new Juggernaut, but the damage he had caused during the battle forced Walters to rethink her feelings for him. An impassioned plea from Sammy’s mother led to Cain receiving a reduced sentence, as well as extradition back to the United States. Cain continued to serve as a member of the X-Men whilst undertaking community service and anger management therapy.\n\nAfter the recent decimation of the mutant population following House of M|\"M-Day,\" Cain journeyed to England where he joined a new incarnation of the British super-team Excalibur. Following an incident involving the&nbsp;Captain Universe&nbsp;entity, Juggernaut was left in a weakened state and has been assigned to the&nbsp;Thunderboltsprogram under the supervision of&nbsp;Luke Cage.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCheck out others who have used the name \"Juggernaut\" at the Disambiguation Page.",

      "biography": "Not much is known about Cain Marko. All that is known is that he was incarcerated by Weapon X and forced to act as a living weapon under the direction of Col. John Wraith. Juggernaut was part of the strike force that took out the X-Men, forcing them into Weapon X as well. When The Brotherhood of Mutants removed the security implants that were prohibiting the mutants from leaving their cells, Juggernaut fought for his freedom. After the entire ordeal, Cain was offered a place with both Professor X's X-men  and Magneto's Brotherhood. Cain chose The Brotherhood, but has apparently left the team for parts unknown. Recently, Juggernaut has bonded with a gem stolen by Rogue and Gambit called the Cyttorak Gem. Though its full repercussions are unknown, Juggernaut did describe himself as feeling \"better than ever.\"When fully powered with the gem, Cain confessed his feelings for Rogue, telling her that he fell in love the first time they met. Rogue did not want this and tried to drain his powers but was easily taken down. Gambit fought Cain as much as he could, ending the battle by charging a card and throwing it at a building, making it collapse on them both.

      "biography": "Manuel Diego Armand Vicente was born in the United States but raised in his parents' native South American country of Vulcan Domuyo. A postage-stamp city-state built around an active volcano, Vulcan Domuyo is a lot like pre-Castro Cuba: corrupt to the bone, with the very rich, very corrupt well-to-do elite class lording it over a terribly impoverished peasant population living in the shadow of certain death from the volcano.Vicente later grew to become a high-ranking officer of Los Cuarenta Ladrones (the LCL), meaning \"the Forty Thieves,\" a dismissive colloquialism for El Ministerio de Asuntos Internacionales Armó Servicio de Vulcan Domuyo-- the Vulcan Domuyan Secret Police. Moreover, due to his dual citizenship, Vicente (who used the alias Danny Vincent) became an agent for U.S. intelligence, writing books for the National Security Agency. Danny regularly did black bag operations for the LCL and the Americans with the code-name Junta.In a recent operation, Danny accepted money from a CIA front, by way of a Russian mobster, to fund an operation to de-stabilize the African nation of Ghudaza. Supposedly, this would be nearly impossible to trace back to the American intelligence community, who hoped to ultimately de-stabilize Ghudaza's neighboring nation, Wakanda, in order to place their own operatives inside the walls of this mysterious and highly advanced kingdom. Unfortunately, Danny's operation caused Ghudaza to degenerate into a brutal civil war and massive ethnic genocide, sending a flood of refugees into Wakanda. Danny's intelligence career was dealt a severe blow, although his American contact, and his associate, the Ghudazan cleric Achebe, did indeed use this situation to gain control of Wakanda (at least until its rightful ruler, the hero Black Panther, regained control.)Later, the LCL, the Russian mob, and the rogue CIA agents Danny worked with earlier formed a shadowy transcontinental cooperative called XCON. XCON began replacing highly-placed political figures with clone-like duplicates, gaining control of Canada before targeting the United States. XCON also began killing key intelligence operatives, causing Danny to flee his former employers of the LCL. As insurance for his own safety, Danny took with him the President of the United States, as XCON had replaced him with a duplicate some weeks before. Danny sought help from operatives of the Black Panther, ultimately teaming with the Panther's ally, Queen Divine Justice. After staying one step ahead of the agents of XCON, Danny and Queen Divine Justice finally returned the President safely to the White House at the same time the Black Panther and his ally Iron Man managed to topple XCON.Unfortunately, Danny was left a pariah, as neither the LCL, his U.S. contacts, nor any espionage agency would talk to him. Danny found his way to his birthplace in Queens, New York, turning to freelance mercenary work, hoping to find one ultimate job that might catapult him back once more into the higher echelons of the intelligence community.A former contact of Danny's, Moishe, offered him a large sum if he would investigate the derailment of the so-called \"Money Train,\" a subway that carried the payoff for hundreds of crooked police officers, judges, and politicians on behalf of the powerful 66 Bridges Gang. Danny correctly guessed, however, that this was merely a setup from 66 Bridges' crime lord Triage, and he confronted Triage directly, agreeing, on his own terms, to get to the Money Train before any cops or rival gang warlords.In fact, the subway was derailed by James Rhodes, who had declared war on the 66 Bridge Gang, as they were also responsible for the death of his sister. The derailment had sparked a running gun battle between police and street gangs. One of the police officers was Kasper Cole, who investigated the scene as the White Tiger. Danny and the White Tiger found themselves embroiled in the battle between police and gang warlords. Rhodes got the drop on both of them, but he wound up helping them escape the cops, who eventually managed to take control of the situation.Rhodes had actually placed a chemical tracer on the Money Train so as to trace the agents of the 66 Bridges Gang to the top echelons. Rhodes pulled together Danny as well as the White Tiger and Justice (the local Muslim minister Josiah X) into an erstwhile team as each of them had reasons of their own to see the end of the 66 Bridges Gang. Danny, for his part, now saw the opportunity to hand Triage over to his superiors in the 66 Bridges of Chicago, earning back his place in serious underworld connections. The team managed to bring to justice scores of crooked contacts, finally ending with Triage. After a climactic battle, the band of heroes ultimately managed to defeat Triage and Danny personally turned him over to the authorities, despite the fact that it might irrevocably damage his mercenary reputation and sever all his former connections.",

      "biography": "Vance Astrovik was a normal teen who found himself secretly protected by the Guardians of the Galaxy, a group of superheroes from an alternate future who feared Vance was a target of the villainous Korvac. Upon meeting Vance Astro, the Guardian who happened to be an alternate-future version of himself, Vance experienced a mental shock that caused his mutant powers to emerge.Vance had often been abused by his father throughout his childhood, but his powers led to more abuse from his father, a violent anti-mutant bigot. Vance soon ran away from home and eventually ended up adventuring alongside the Thing, who was taking a leave of absence from the Fantastic Four. Calling himself Marvel Boy, Astrovik joined the Thing as a member of the Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation before finally parting ways.Vance, as Marvel Boy, later tried to join the Avengers, but was told by his hero, Captain America, that he needed more experience. Feeling rejected and embarrassed, Vance was then approached by Night Thrasher and Nova, who were forming their own team called the New Warriors. Vance quickly became one of the Warriors' most stalwart members and met fellow mutant Firestar, with whom he developed a romantic relationship.Returning home for a brief period, Vance was struck again by his father, and, when retaliating with his powers, Vance killed him. His mother pressed charges, and Vance was arrested, serving time for murder. Later released for good behavior, Vance adopted a new guise as Justice, and rejoined the New Warriors, often serving in leadership roles.  Firestar eventually asked Vance to marry her.Vance and Firestar, alongside their teammate Rage, were drawn into conflict with monsters summoned by evil sorceress Morgan Le Fay. Rage, once a member of the Avengers, brought the couple with him as the Avengers reassembled after a period of disbanding to defeat Le Fey. After a strong push to prove himself, Vance, with Firestar, were elected reserve members.After serving several missions, and feeling vastly inferior to be joining the same league as his idols, Vance was elected to full membership. Continually trying to prove himself, Justice eventually won over his insecurities during the Avengers' battle with the robot Ultron. He had researched the Avengers files, discovering a new means of defeating Ultron and using it to help the Avengers destroy him. After seeing the emotional turmoil Hank Pym and the Wasp went through in the battle, Vance finally began to regard the Avengers as people rather than icons and became more relaxed about working with the team.Soon afterward, Vance announced his engagement with Firestar, and the two left active duty, presumably to explore their relationship. In reality, they were asked to secretly infiltrate the headquarters of the Triune Understanding, whose leader, Jonathan Tremont, was surreptitiously attacking the Avengers' public image for his own benefit. Vance and Firestar discovered the true cause of the Understanding-- using the beliefs of its members to sympathetically power a spaceship to battle a cosmic menace. They helped a contingent of Avengers join the battle against the menace, and directly afterwards helped the heroes keep the time-travelling Kang from conquering the world. After the crises were averted, they again parted company with the Avengers. Vance settled into civilian life with relative ease, as much as a public trial, a Dateline special, and four books written about him could allow, although Firestar had a rough transition settling into college studies at Empire State University.  Vance was eagerly awaiting the next stage in his life, their upcoming marriage, but Firestar was reluctant. After a heart-to-heart, the couple agreed to call off the wedding, and even the status of their relationship remains uncertain.",

      "biography": "Born in South Africa circa 1918, three-year old David Rand accompanied his British parents, John and Constance, on a flight to Cairo to visit his grandfather, but their plane crashed in the Belgian Congo. Injured, Constance died shortly thereafter, driving John slightly  mad. Living in the jungle with his father, isolated from the local tribes, David grew under the jungle’s hardships into an unusually powerful youth and developed strong empathy with wildlife, notably rescuing the lion Zar from quicksand. When criminal Paul de Kraft discovered emeralds in the Congo, John Rand died opposing him, but Zar drove de Kraft off. With Zar’s support, David became the jungle’s leading warrior within a few years, challenging Bardak the ape, N’Jaga the Leopard, and others. Considered godlike by the natives, he became known as “Ka-Zar” or “brother of the lion”. When de Kraft returned to seize the emerald deposits, the vengeful Ka-Zar killed him. Aided by animal allies, Ka-Zar appointed himself guardian of the jungle, meeting out harsh retribution to any intruder seeking to exploit his resources-but he frequently aided more benign explorers, such as when he protected Prof. Rice and his daughter Mara from the criminal pilot “Red” Skelton, rescued Rita Grey from the Wabi tribe, and helped two Scotland Yard detectives capture murderer London Jack. When Zar was captured by first the vicious Rajah Sarput and then big game hunter Bradley, who shipped him to the U.S., Ka-Zar stowed away on the ship. He freed Zar when the ship docked in New York but was arrested for trying to free zoo animals as well. Fortunately, Ruth Wilson, another woman whom Ka-Zar had rescued during an African expedition, vouched for him, and he and Zar were granted passage back to Africa on a British ship. Surviving attacks by entrenched Nazi forces, they confronted Sarput, who was ultimately slain by their elephant ally Trajah. Soon after, Ka-Zar learned he had inherited his father’s Transvaal diamond mines and, after preventing his inheritance’s theft by John Rand’s law partner Alec Wright, donated the wealth to war relief in England. On an expedition to the mysterious Black River Region, Ka-Zar encountered giants and subterranean lizard-people, befriending the giant Bogat. Later, he waged a series of campaigns against Axis forces in Ethiopia, Somaliland, and elsewhere, killing them with their own artillery both on his own and with cooperation with British and French forces. Following one such encounter, Ka-Zar was restored to health by an aged witch doctor, who gave him a brew used centuries before to grant his tribe superhuman strength, Ka-Zar’s exploits earned him such fame that he was invited to attend a meeting of superhuman champions in mid-194, and he protected his region’s wildlife when Africa was threatened by monstrous tidal waves from Atlantean warfare. Ka-Zar’s activities were last reported later that year; his subsequent life remains unchronicled.* NOTE - Ka-Zar (David Rand) is not to be confused with Ka-Zar (Kevin Plunder) the ruler of the Savage Land.",

      "biography": "Kevin Plunder's father led an exhibition to Antarctica for a rare element, which they found the jungles of the Savage Land where this \"Anti-Metal,\" later known as Vibranium, was found. When ruthless agents tried steal Lord Plunder's stash of Vibranium, he separated his two children and left for refuge in the Savage Land with his eldest, Kevin. Lord Plunder was killed, however, by natives of the Man-Ape tribe, although Kevin was saved by the sudden appearance of Zabu. Zabu took Kevin with him into the Land of Mists, and the Man-Apes called him Ka-Zar, which means \"Son of the Tiger.\" Ka-Zar grew up in the Land of Mists alongside Zabu, who taught him how to survive.By the time he was an adult, Ka-Zar had abandoned his former life of privilege for that of a \"savage,\" surviving in the harsh Savage Land. His brother, who called himself Parnival the Plunderer, finally found his brother and fought Ka-Zar for his half of their father's \"key.\" The key would serve as a catalyst to activate the Vibranium's properties of \"melting\" other metals in its area. Ka-Zar eventually regained his knowledge of his British upbringing, acting like \"an irreverent Americanized adventurer.\" Staying in the Savage Land as its self-proclaimed protector, Ka-Zar had many adventures and teamed up with many super heroes. He later met and married Shanna The She-Devil, and more recently, they had a son, Matthew.Ka-Zar and Shanna only left the Savage Land for a brief time when the two were rescued by the Avengers after a giant alien Terminus succeeded in destroying the Savage Land. They wandered the world, but later found the Savage Land regenerating itself and returned. They were on hand to aid such friends as the X-Men; Magneto, who confronted Zaladane and her Savage Land Mutates; and the Sub-Mariner, who fought various corporations from excavating the Land's resources. More recently, Ka-Zar and Shanna left the Savage Land again to pursue Parnival the Plunderer, who stole alien technology that enabled the Savage Land to maintain its environment. They ultimately defeated Parnival and his master, the cosmic Titan, Thanos. Ka-Zar remains protector of the Savage Land.* NOTE - Ka-Zar (Kevin Plunder) is not to be mistaken for Ka-Zar (David Rand), an adventurer from 30's and 40's who teamed up with the original Human Torch several times.",

      "biography": "Kaine was the first of the Jackal's experiments in cloning that did not immediately degenerate into raw genetic waste. He was a clone of Peter Parker, the original Spider-Man. After some time, however, slow genetic deterioration became apparent. The Jackal became disgusted by yet another failure and planned to kill his creation, forcing the rejected clone to flee. The clone came to call himself Kaine and eventually adopted a costume that slowed his deterioration and hid his skin, but reproduced the web-like scars that run all over his body. Even as his DNA deteriorated, Kaine grew taller and stronger than the original Spider-Man. Unable to live a normal life because of his disfigured features, Kaine's anger grew with his strength. Most of all he hated Scarlet Spider whom he, like the Jackal, believed to be the original Spider-Man, and thus the reason for his tormented existence. Believing Peter to be a successful clone, Kaine took it upon himself to ensure that Peter led the charmed life denied the Jackal's other experiments. This ambition eventually led Kaine to murder the Grim Hunter and Dr. Octopus (Otto Octavius).Kaine followed Ben around the world, working occasionally as a high-priced assassin. In Salt Lake City, three years after leaving New York, Kaine killed Detective Louise Kennedy, the only person who ever made Kaine feel loved, after learning that she was in league with the local mob. Ben was spotted at the scene shortly after, and Kennedy's partner, Detective Jacob Raven, eventually tracked Reilly's fingerprints back to the original Peter Parker in New York City and arrested Peter. Peter was exonerated only after he threatened to make his secret identity known and Kaine confessed to the crime in another effort to preserve Peter's happiness. After Ben was \"revealed\" to be the original Spider-Man, Kaine escaped from police custody but was killed by Spidercide, a shape-shifting clone of Spider-Man. The Jackal put Kaine's body in a clone regeneration pod, where it was revived some time later.Still attempting to crush Reilly's spirit, Kaine used Elizabeth Tyne (who was living under the assumed name of Janine Godbe after shooting her abusive father), the love of Ben's life since they had met in Salt Lake City. Threatening to expose her to the police, Kaine ordered Janine to fake her own suicide and leave Ben as he wandered America. After Ben took the role of Spider-Man, Kaine lured Janine back to New York and attempted to kill himself and them. Their love inspired him to relent, and both Kaine and Janine surrendered to the police.Kaine later escaped from prison and was last seen in Greece until he reappeared tracking Raptor; an associate of Ben Reilly's, who believed Reilly to have killed his family. When Raptor mistakenly approached Peter Parker concerning his family's deaths, Kaine ultimately stepped in and killed him.Kaine was later hunted down by the Kravinoff family in their quest to kill all the \"Spiders,\" hoping to resurrect Kraven. Peter's blood was needed to perform the ritual, however, Kaine knocked Peter unconscious, posed as him, was killed, and his sacrifice was used to bring Kraven the Hunter back to life. Yet, the resurrection could only be successful with the true blood of Peter Parker, and as a consequence Kraven is undead rather than truly alive. Though it seemed Kaine had in death found the peace he'd never known in life, it was short-lived. He emerged from his grave, regenerated, alive, and mutated. This coincided with the reappearance of the Jackal, who informed Kaine that his cells will always regenerate and that he was to be the first subject in his grand experiment. The Jackal transformed Kaine into a hulking man-like spider whom he named \"Tarantula\". Under the control The Queen, Tarantula acted as The Jackal's henchman and was sent to contaminate the cure for the Spider-Island virus at Horizon Labs. While there, he encountered Spider-Man who battled him to a standstill. Tarantula quickly blinded Spider-Man with his webs and dangled him over the giant pool of cure, only to have him regain his Spider Sense at the last possible instant. In one swift move, Tarantula was thrown into the pool. As Spider-Man looked on, Kaine emerged from the pool, freed of The Queen's mind control, the Jackal's mutation, and his own degeneration scars. He then informed Spider-Man that The Queen was behind Spider-Island.",

      "biography": "Nathaniel Richards was born in the calendar year 3000 of the alternate timeline Other Earth (a.k.a. Earth-6311). Bullied as a youth, his throat was slit by a bully, Morgan, and he was hospitalized for a year. Recovering, he studied science and his ancestor's history tapes of the heroic age of Earth-616 (mainstream Earth), growing into a man of adventure in a time of complacency. At age 25 he discovered his ancestor's fortress and time machine. Following encounters with alternate Earth Fantastic Fours seeking to thwart his future self, which faded from his mind, Richards constructed an immense sphinx-shaped ship and traveled to Egypt circa 2950 BC. The ship crashed, blinding and stranding him there, but he subjugated the natives with his technology. He forced the natives to procure for him a radioactive herb which would restore his sight, then, as Pharaoh Rama-Tut, he ruled as a god for a decade, during which he encountered Samira, Mistress of the Nile, who became his enemy; Amenhotep, whom he transformed into a vampiric creature; and time-travelers such as Killpower and the Genetix team. At some point he had a son, Ramades, by a slave. Eventually, a struggle with the Fantastic Four, which also involved the young En Sabah Nur (later Apocalypse), the moon god Khonshu, and modern-era heroes Dr. Strange and the Avengers, forced Rama to flee that time period.\n\nEn route to the future, a \"time storm\" diverted Rama to the modern era and an encounter with a space-lost Dr. Doom. Damaged by the time storm, Rama-Tut's control module skipped several years into the future and briefly crashed in Egypt, where he fought fellow time-travelers Blaquesmith and Cable. Inspired by Doom, he took the armored identity of the Scarlet Centurion, traveled to another timeline (Earth-689) and duped its Avengers into neutralizing all their fellow heroes so he could rule; but he was defeated by the visiting Avengers of Earth-616 and cast outside time.\n\nRichards sought to return to his native time, but temporal disruptions hurled him into Other Earth's 40th century. As Kang, he conquered that entire world, sparing only the tiny kingdom of Carelius due to his interest in the king's daughter, Ravonna. Kang's life became progressively non-linear, as each foray in time produced at least one divergent-timestream counterpart; it is extremely difficult to identify which Kang counterpart was involved with each encounter. Conquering everything within 100 light years, Kang next attacked his ancestor's world in the modern age of marvels, but the Avengers forced him to flee. Seeking a new power base, Kang established himself in 1901 AD as Victor Timely, a brilliant inventor and industrialist who founded the city of Timely, Wisconsin, became its first mayor, and transformed it into a technological marvel over the next century; \"Victor\" appeared to age and be replaced by his children (Kang in new guises). The city also housed a portal to his base Chronopolis where he gathered warriors from various eras to serve as his strike force, the Anachronauts. Kang's continued efforts saw his Spider-Man robot (Timespinner) destroyed by the Avengers and Spider-Man, and his conquest of Camelot foiled by the time-traveling Thing and Human Torch. He also assaulted the Reed and Sue Richards wedding, unknowingly drawn there by Dr. Doom's Emotion Charger device.\n\nReturning to the 40th century, Kang completed his galactic conquest and even invaded other dimensions. In Kosmos, he gained technology to create his powerful Growing Men. Kang then brought the Avengers forward in time, intending to subjugate them or defeat them in front of Ravonna. When both the Avengers and Ravonna defied him, the furious Kang easily conquered her small kingdom; however, when he tried to force Ravonna to marry him, he caused unrest in his troops for failing to follow his own edict of slaying all conquered rulers. Kang's troops, led by General Baltag, turned on him, but he allied with the Avengers to defeat them. Impressed that Kang had risked his life for her, Ravonna leapt in the path of a blast from the defeated Baltag, saving Kang, but apparently dying in his place. The devastated Kang sought to restore Ravonna. Later, the cosmic Grandmaster challenged him to a contest of champions, offering him the power of life or death as the prize. Using the Avengers as pawns, Kang was victorious, but he chose the power of death, intending to slay the Avengers. Foiled by the Black Knight, Kang had to live with the knowledge that he had squandered his chance to save Ravonna. Disturbed at having lost and feeling sympathy for Ravonna, the Grandmaster removed Ravonna from stasis, revived her, and told her of Kang's betrayal. Moving on, Kang tried to use the Hulk to destroy Bruce Banner's ancestor to prevent the Avengers from ever forming, but the Hulk foiled this plot. Kang then sent a robot double of himself to capture the Avengers during a war with rival time lord Zarrko the Tomorrow Man.\n\nOne of Kang's most relentless campaigns was his quest for the Celestial Madonna, a woman fated to give birth to the most powerful being in the universe. Wanting to be that being's father, Kang narrowed the Madonna's identity to Agatha Harkness, Mantis, and the Scarlet Witch, abducting all three. Rama-Tut, actually Kang's own future self, arrived to help the Avengers thwart his plot. Mantis was finally revealed as the Madonna, and when Kang could not claim her, he tried to kill her; but his fatal blast was intercepted by the Swordsman, who died instead. Kang and Rama-Tut were then pulled into Limbo by Immortus, a potential future self of both men, but Kang imprisoned Immortus and used his technology to create the Legion of the Unliving, a team of reportedly deceased pawns drawn from past eras. The Avengers defeated the Legion and Kang fled. Kang soon returned, allied with a trio of Kangs from different time periods, and tried to abduct Mantis at her wedding, but Immortus foiled him by substituting a Space Phantom as his captive.\n\nKang next made a base in Tombstone, Arizona, circa 1873 AD, intending to use it as a stepping stone to conquer the modern age. Opposed by cowboy heroes, as well as time-traveling Avengers, Kang disintegrated when his force field shorted out in battle with Thor. However, a failsafe device transported Kang's consciousness to an alternate body, as it had during many other near-death experiences. Though taking place in rapid succession in the modern era, these last two campaigns accounted for ten years of Kang's life. Less time-intensive efforts included seeking the reality-altering power of a Cosmic Cube, facilitating an attempt by the Inuit (Eskimo) Aningan Kenojuak to reclaim Captain America as the \"God in the Ice\" worshipped by his people years ago, conquering an alternate 40th-century Earth, battling the legendary First Line, and participating in the hero vs. villain war on the virtually omnipotent Beyonder's Battleworld.\n\nKang then found his 40th-century base ravaged by rebels loyal to Baltag. To recover his base, he sought out a Growing Man stored in the modern era and battled Thor, who banished him to Limbo. There Kang chanced across Immortus' stronghold, Tenebrae, and learned of his own multitude of divergent counterparts. Unwittingly manipulated by Immortus, Kang formed the Council of Kangs, choosing a few of his most capable counterparts as allies, and began eliminating redundant Kangs from each alternate reality. One of these sought to pair with an alternate Ravonna and wipe out all other realities, but was eliminated after accidentally killing his lover. Kang prepared robot duplicates to replace the slain counterparts to rule the empires of every Kang in existence. At the same time, Kang re-took his 40th-century base via his Growing Man. After the rest of the counterparts were eliminated, the prime Kang slew the rest of the Council.\n\nImmortus then appeared, explained that he was Kang's future self, and showed Kang a psyche-globe containing the memories of all of the slain divergent Kangs. Kang tore the globe from his hands, only to go mad as the minds of all of the other Kangs merged with his. The last Kang-now every Kang, since he possessed all of his counterparts' memories-fled into Limbo. To save himself, Kang used his helmet's temporal circuitry to create an additional divergence/counterpart, dividing his madness between two Kangs. One made his way to Chronopolis to recuperate, while the other, still addled, was recruited by the Cross-Time Kangs, a group of beings who had defeated or slain alternate Kangs and usurped the Kang identity. That Kang learned of a plot by Kang-Nebula (actually a power-hungry Ravonna) to obtain the \"ultimate weapon\" within the Time Bubble, a period of time in Earth-8810 surrounded by an impassable temporal barrier. A trio of Kangs followed Kang-Nebula into the Time Bubble where they were cast into the vortex surrounding it and ultimately destroyed, though the divergent Kang also sent his Growing Man to help foil the demonic Inferno invasion of Earth.\n\nTaking control of Chronopolis, the prime Kang sought revenge on Mantis in the modern era, joined Dr. Doom during the Infinity War, took over the Cross-Time Kangs, learned an assassin was stalking him, and exposed his would-be killer as Ravonna, now calling herself the Terminatrix. Intrigued by her warrior nature, Kang battled her, but sacrificed himself to save her from an assault by the Avengers. Overcoming her hatred for Kang, Ravonna impersonated him and took over the Cross-Time Kangs. When Chronopolis was attacked by the immensely powerful temporal entity Alioth, Ravonna revived Kang, and with the aid of the Avengers they sacrificed the Cross-Time Kangs, using their energy to imprison Alioth.\n\nThe reunited Kang and Ravonna (who posed as Victor Timely's fiancée Rebecca Tourmenet for a time) soon ruled Chronopolis side by side. However, Kang, now almost sixty, grew weary of administrative matters. Missing the days when he was worshipped in a small land, Kang returned to ancient Egypt circa 2930 BC as Rama-Tut and smashed his chrono-sphere. As Rama-Tut, he spent ten years benevolently enjoying his people's adulation. In 2920 BC he encountered the Avengers, who had been trapped in the past by a time machine that could only travel backwards in time. Determined not to become Immortus (whose subtle manipulations he despised), the later Rama-Tut tried to break the cycle by placing himself in suspended animation, reviving in the modern era to battle his past Kang self during the Celestial Madonna struggle. Failing to change the course of events and feeling resigned to his fate, Rama headed for Limbo, but upon glimpsing a chrono-flash of Immortus bowing to the powerful Time-Keepers, he was infuriated by the idea of becoming anyone's lap-dog, and vowed to overcome his destiny. Rama-Tut returned to Chronopolis, resumed his Kang identity and used his rivals to destroy each other. He then destroyed the mind-transfer failsafe device he had so often used to cheat death, feeling that it took the risk-and thus the enjoyment-out of conflict. After a brief battle with the X-Men and an enterprising starship crew, Kang formed an alliance with Libra (Gustav Brandt), the Kree Supreme Intelligence and the Avengers against Immortus and the Time-Keepers. Ravonna and the Anachronauts were apparently slain and Chronopolis was destroyed, but Kang managed to destroy the Time-Keepers and forcibly diverge himself from Immortus, leaving his future uncharted.\n\nRenewed by this victory, Kang engineered a series of successors, each of whom he named Marcus. These infants were sent back in time and trained to be warriors worthy of inheriting Kang's empire. Following a failed effort to conquer the realm Otherworld, Kang, alongside Marcus XXIII (outfitted as the Scarlet Centurion), used Damocles Base, his massive armada, and alliances with various criminal forces (including rogue Atlanteans and Deviants) to conquer Earth; but the Avengers led a rebellion that ultimately defeated and imprisoned Kang. Marcus freed Kang in hopes of restoring their dominion, but Kang knew that Marcus had held back during the war more than once because of his attraction to Avengers member Warbird. Unable to forgive this betrayal, Kang slew Marcus. Disheartened, Kang told his computer to postpone development of Marcus XXIV. Regaining his focus, Kang plotted against Iron Lad, his younger self created by his meddling in his own past, and his allies in the Young Avengers.\n\nNote: Differences between the history of Other-Earth and Earth-616, as well as differing calendars in different realms, and damage to records during periods of massive warfare, have led to some inconsistency in the dating of the time periods of both Kang and Ravonna.",

      "biography": "Although gainfully employed as an interior decorator, Brian Hibbs nurtured a lifelong desire to be a super-villain. His fascination inexplicably fixated upon Frank Oliver, a.k.a. Kangaroo, a minor adversary of Spider-Man; after Oliver’s ignominious death, Hibbs spent years learning Kangaroo’s skills. As the new Kangaroo, he worked for the criminal Corporation in Mississippi with moderate success, and then relocated to New York to pick up where his idol left off. Caught up in a robbery spree, he was taken unaware by Spider-Man, who downed him with one punch and laughed about the encounter the rest of the day.Hibbs escaped police custody and, using half of the wealth left to him in a trust fund, splurged on kangaroo-motif armor, complete with tail and pouch. Seeking a rematch, he was again knocked down by Spider-Man. His armor protected him, but its faulty weapon system collapsed the armor around the embarrassed criminal, whom Spider-Man left for the police. He was soon freed by the Grizzly, another of Spider-Man’s less-respected opponents, who teamed with Kangaroo, the Gibbon and the Spot as the Spider-Man Revenge Squad. The group’s motivations were divided: while Grizzly and Gibbon craved only payback for past humiliation, Kangaroo and Spot sought straightforward crime. Their dispute-ridden spree was interrupted by Spider-Man, who derided them as \"the Legion of Losers,\" but his overconfidence left him careless enough to be defeated. Kangaroo, irritated by Grizzly’s and Gibbon’s second thoughts, lashed out at Grizzly, only to knock himself out instead.\nSpider-Man allowed the repentant pair to escape and hauled Kangaroo and Spot to prison, where Kangaroo exorcised his frustrations by building up his fighting skills and strength, earning the skills he hoped might later give pause to his opponents.Soon at liberty again, Kangaroo underwent treatment seeking superhuman mutation. When this seemingly failed, he became a professional baseball player as Billy Bob Jenks, but, although he quickly rose to super-star status, he was expelled from the sport after his criminal past came to light. Returning to crime, he was quickly recaptured and imprisoned, his admittedly embarrassing super-villain career probably provoking more concern than he warranted. Incarcerated at the power-dampening Cage, Kangaroo parlayed his unaffected human-level fighting skills into prison respect. However, stress and exertion catalyzed his earlier mutation attempts, increasing his size and strength while retarding his intellect and fostering the delusional belief that he was the late Oliver; his newly increased strength might have approached superhuman level, but in the Cage there was little way to tell and less chance to use it. When Tombstone, one of Spider-Man’s deadlier enemies, was sentenced to the Cage, Kangaroo was eager to intimidate him, but Tombstone remained unimpressed, though their brawl sparked an intense rivalry. When Tombstone was held in solitary confinement, Kangaroo terrorized his prisoner allies — Big Ben, Hypno-Hustler, and Rocket Racer — but Tombstone spread a false tip that his room could be reached via a heating vent. Kangaroo became stuck in the endeavor, leaving him to be brutalized by a prison gang, the Cruisers. Tombstone soon escaped, but Kangaroo remains in prison, remade far more than he intended.",

Still, as a member of the Inhuman royal family, he has played a crucial role in the history of his people, helping his cousin Black Bolt become the king of Attilan.\n\nThe Shatterer is Born\n\nMillennia ago, the alien Kree Supreme Intelligence experimented on alien species to breed super-soldiers to serve in the Kree Empire’s interminable war against the shape-shifting Skrulls. On Earth, 25,000 years ago, the Kree turned prehistoric humans into Inhumans, who settled on the island Attilan off Atlantis’ coast. The Inhumans later discovered Terrigen Crystals from which they derived Terrigen Mists to unlock each Inhuman’s super-powered potential. Developing the sacred rite of Terrigenesis, they exposed children to the mists at their coming-of-age, with the Genetics Council strictly controlling which Inhuman couples could have children.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, Karnak was born into the House of Agon, the Inhuman Royal Family, the second son of philosopher priest Mander and ocean biologist Azur. Terrigenesis leaves his brother Triton unable to survive out of water unassisted, so the couple decide to raise Karnak without Terrigen mutation, instead enrolling him in his father’s religious seminary in the Tower of Wisdom where he trains in physical and mental disciplines.",

      "biography": "Kevin \"Kasper\" Cole was the son of NYPD hero cop \"Black Jack\" Cole and Ruth Cole, a New York Jew. When Kasper was still a teenager, Black Jack Cole was framed and sentenced to prison. Kasper, nevertheless, grew to become a police officer working in the 74th precinct. There, he earned the nickname \"Kasper\" due to his light-toned skin.When Kasper's commanding officer, Sal Anthony, asked him to run an errand, his crew inexplicably got jumped at an undercover drug bust, an obvious set-up. For ruining the bust, Kasper found himself with a temporary suspension. During his suspension, Kasper stole a costume of the Black Panther from Sergeant Tork, his boss and a former ally of the original Panther. Kasper, using the costume, then raided an accounting session between the 66 Bridges gang and a group of corrupt police officers. Kasper discovered the 66 Bridges gang had grew to become a large organized crime syndicate, including ties with political and private figures. Sal Anthony was one of those on the 66 Bridges' take. Kapser dedicated himself to taking down Anthony and the Bridges, balancing his aggressive pursuit while supporting his mother and his pregnant girlfriend.At the time, T'Challa, the true Black Panther, had disappeared. The appearance of a new Panther aroused the interest of Hunter, the White Wolf, adopted brother and rival of the Black Panther and chieftain of the outlawed Hatut Zeraze tribe, the Wakanda secret police. Hunter offered Kasper counsel in his new heroic role, although Kasper refused. Hunter nevertheless began to actively pursue Kasper as his new protégé, and Kasper soon discovered T'Challa alive and hiding in Brooklyn. T'Challa refused to answer any of Kasper's questions, including the question of whether T'Challa had set up Kasper to succeed him.Kaspar discovered the leader of the 66 Bridges to be the man known as Kibuka, although he could never approach him or discover his true identity. During this time, Sal Anthony captured and killed Sergeant Tork, believing him to be the Black Panther. In grief and anger over his friend's death, Kasper felt driven to a desperate maneuver-- to offer to join Anthony's crooked crew. Anthony set Kasper up to take a fall, but Kasper turned the tables on Anthony with the help of T'Challa and Hunter and the Hatut Zeraze. He had discovered Anthony's secrets that forced the Captain to join the 66 Bridges, and in the final showdown, Kasper put his own life on the line. Ultimately, Internal Affairs, who had earlier hoped that Kasper would help them, was forced to move in before they were ready. Anthony was disciplined and demoted, becoming Kasper's new supervisor in the narcotics division.In the course of further clashes against the 66 Bridges gang, Kasper was forced to realize that the best he could hope to be was merely a normal man posing as the Black Panther. Determined to become more than that, he confronted T'Challa, the true Black Panther, and demanded the ancient Wakandan Rite of Ascension, the end of which would allow Kasper to partake of the heart-shaped herb, the source of the Black Panther's superhuman powers. Although disinclined, the T'Challa agreed, warning that Kasper would have to confront the Wakanda chieftain in the final test. In fact, the villain Killmonger, who once usurped T'Challa's position as chieftain, managed to revive from a death-like state and resume his post as chieftain. It was Killmonger who Kasper confronted and was unable to defeat.Instead, Killmonger offered Kasper a deal. Killmonger offered Kasper a genetically-modified version of the herb to match Kasper's non-Wakanda physiology and the position of \"White Tiger,\" an acolyte of the Panther Cult under Killmonger's service. Killmonger further offered to help Kasper get information regarding Sergeant Anthony's son, who was kidnapped by the 66 Bridges gang to keep Anthony on their payroll. Kasper agreed, and Killmonger, for his part, gained a servant who would owe him a favor as well as the opportunity to annoy T'Challa and to one-up the White Wolf.Knowing that if Killmonger would find Anthony's son first, he would be inexorably indebted to him, Kasper used his new herb-enhanced abilities to track down the boy on his own. He managed to find the boy first, finding him with T'Challa. T'Challa had been watching Kasper from day one, surreptitiously helping him as best he could to pass this unique ascension. He also revealed that Kasper had direct African lineage, a fact that would help the Wakanda tribal council accept him as a true White Tiger.Kasper continued to use the White Tiger identity while living with his mother and girlfriend and working for the NYPD. He was always on the search for a big break, one that would allow him a promotion, and a raise, to help support his family; however, most such cases would require him to work as the White Tiger and deny his police identity to claim responsibility for the arrest.The payoff for the 66 Bridge's network of crooked contacts was carried by the legendary \"Money Train\" subway, which Rhodes managed to derail. The derailment, however, sparked a running gun battle beneath the streets of the Mog as both police and street gangs competed to be the first to reach the crash site. One of the police officers was Kasper Cole, who investigated as the White Tiger. The derailment also brought the former freelance spy Junta, and they both found themselves embroiled in the battle between police and gang warlords. James Rhodes got the drop on both of them but wound up helping them escape the cops, who eventually managed to take control of the situation.Rhodes had actually placed a chemical tracer on the Money Train so as to trace the agents of the 66 Bridges Gang to the top echelons. Rhodes pulled together Kasper as well as Junta and Justice (the local Muslim minister Josiah X) into an erstwhile team as each of them had reasons of their own to see the end of the 66 Bridges Gang. Kasper, in particular, hoped to earn the promotion he so desperately sought. The team managed to bring to justice scores of crooked contacts, finally tracing the 66 Bridges to Grace &amp; Tymbalt, a multi-media company, which served as a corporate front and of which the ruthless gangster Nigel \"Triage\" Blacque was corporate CEO. In a climactic battle, Kasper was forced to choose between turning in Triage and helping Rhodes survive the encounter. He helped to save Rhodes' life, and Junta ultimately managed to defeat Triage and turn him over to the authorities.",

      "biography": "Klaus Voorhees was a convicted criminal who was assigned to become the lab assistant of renown medical researcher and humanitarian Professor Shecktor. At the side of the scientist, Voorhees learned a great deal about serpents and chemistry, but soon grew envious of the Schecktor's achievements and the respect he received from his peers. Eventually his jealousy evolved into hatred, and Voorhees decided to murder Shecktor by making a cobra from the lab to bite him. Voorhees would then cause himself to be bitten by the cobra (making the whole incident look like an accident), but he would then consume an experimental antidote for the snake venom. Putting his plan in motion, Voorhees succeeded in murdering Shecktor. Unknown to Voorhees, however, the serpent he chose had been irradiated as part of an experimental process for the immunization of humans against snake venom. The antidote saved Voorhees' life, but the irradiated poison of the cobra endowed him with powers similar to those of a snake. Deciding to use his new abilities for criminal enterprise, Voorhees adopted the costumed identity of the Cobra. His first attempt at crime involved the concoction of a cobra-serum in order to transform the world's populace into similarly snake-powered slaves. His plan, however, was thwarted by the thunder god Thor, who would become the Cobra's arch-nemesis in the early years of his villainous career.After numerous attempts at crime, the Cobra teamed up with Mister Hyde to gain revenge on Thor, and despite their defeat, they began a long partnership together. Their next team-up was on behalf of Loki. On his urging, the two kidnapped Blake’s nurse and love interest, Jane Foster but were again defeated by Thor. The pair crossed the paths of many heroes, most notably Daredevil and Spider-Man. The Cobra parted company with Hyde for a time, joining with the original Viper’s Serpent Squad  and battling against Captain America and the Falcon. Later, he was freed from prison by a new Serpent Squad led by the female Viper. He immediately challenged the Viper’s leadership, but she quickly and soundly defeated him. The Squad’s objective was to raise the sunken continent Lemuria to aid Viper’s ally, the warlord Krang. The Viper, however, was operating under the influence of the Serpent Crown, and the Cobra suddenly felt out of his element-- after all, he was only in it for the money, and not the resultant clash with the authorities and Captain America (in his identity of Nomad.) The Cobra and Viper were the only two to escape the authorities, but the police managed to track them back to the U.S. In the final battle, the Cobra tried to cut and run, but Viper, enraged by his cowardice, shot him in the back. Nevertheless, Nomad and the Cobra seemed to be the only ones to escape the hideout as it went down in flames. The Cobra and Mister Hyde, working on behalf of the Purple Man, suffered yet another defeat from Daredevil, were remanded to Ryker’s Island prison. The Cobra used his powers to escape, but willingly left Hyde behind when they ran into difficulties. Enraged, Hyde swore vengeance on his former partner. Mister Hyde would later return to stalk the Cobra, who was at this time was seriously fearing for his life. Hyde was stopped by Spider-Man, after a long and ferocious battle, by getting stunned after being knocked out a high window. The Cobra was recruited by the Sidewinder to become a member of his new organization, the Serpent Society. The Cobra remained with this organization for a long time, rising to become one of Sidewinder's most trusted lieutenants. When Viper returned to take over the Society, the Cobra (among with Society members Anaconda and Cottonmouth) decided to support her as the new leader. He began to question Viper, however, when she revealed her plan to mutate everyone in Washington DC into serpent-like creatures. Eventually, the Cobra rebelled and single-handedly defeated Viper, who he later turned over to Captain America. With Viper's takeover thwarted, the Serpent Society was reorganized. Bitter over his betrayal by various Society members, Sidewinder resigned from his position as team leader, leaving the Cobra in his stead.This began a new period of Voorhees’ life, as his recent successes lent him a determination to re-invent himself for his new position of leadership, The Cobra sought out the one person that he still feared above all-- Mister Hyde. After going one-on-one with his former partner, the Cobra succeeded in besting him. Flushed with new confidence, he renamed himself King Cobra, and the long grudge match between the two seemed to be over. Under King Cobra’s leadership, the Society first tried to put Diamondback on trial for betraying them by developing a relationship with Captain America. The trial was a disaster. Not only did Diamondback escape (with the help of Sidewinder), but he lost the support of her friends within the group, and Diamondback led Captain America and Paladin to the team to take them down. With its members scattered, the Serpent Society remained too fragmented to be considered a significant threat as it was under Sidewinder’s direction. Indeed, it was only after creating new “Sidewinders” with similar teleportaion technology as their namesakes that the team could once again operate at full capacity. King Cobra appeared as one of the many villains who were freed upon a massive breakout of the Raft staged by Electro. Although many were thwarted by the new Avengers, King Cobra managed to get away but became the first such escapee who the new hero Toxin hoped to bring to justice. Toxin used Mister Hyde as an informant on his former partner, successuflly tracking him down, and King Cobra was brought back to prison. When the Commission on Superhuman Activities persuaded the Thunderbolts to track down super-villains and recruit them to join the pro-registration side of the Civil War|Superhuman Registration Act, King Cobra decided to join the Thunderbolts.",

      "biography": "Katherine \"Kitty\" Pryde was a 13½-year old Jewish girl whose genius level intellect allowed her to take college-level courses despite her young age. Kitty led a fairly normal life until she began suffering headaches of steadily increasing intensity, which were a result of her emerging mutant power.\n\nKitty herself was unaware that she was a mutant until the afternoon that Emma Frost, then White Queen of the Hellfire Club, arrived to speak to her parents about enrolling Kitty in her Massachusetts Academy. During the visit, Kitty suffered her worst headache yet and went upstairs to her room. When the headache stopped, Kitty was surprised to find she was on the floor of her living room. She had unknowingly used her power to phase through solid matter for the first time, passing through her bed and floor into the room below.\n\nAfter Frost left, Professor Charles Xavier arrived with three of the X-Men, his own team of mutant students who fought for peaceful coexistence between humans and mutants. Following an attack by the Hellfire Club during which Kitty helped the team, the X-Man Phoenix telepathically coerced Kitty's parents into allowing her to join Xavier's school, and she became the newest and youngest member of the X-Men. Kitty originally called herself Sprite, but later adopted the codename Ariel. Xavier also arranged for Kitty to be enrolled in dance classes at the studio of instructor Stevie Hunter.\n\nKitty quickly became a valuable member of the X-Men, proving her worth one Christmas Eve by single-handedly defeating one of the demonic N'Garai. Kitty formed a close friendship with both the X-Man Storm and the mutant sorceress Illyana Rasputin. The bond between Kitty and Illyana grew so strong that Kitty was eventually able to manifest the Soulsword, the ultimate expression of Illyana's magical nature.\n\nKitty also formed a romance with her teammate Piotr Rasputin (Colossus), and she gained a constant companion on an adventure in space in the form of a small alien dragon-like creature she named Lockheed. Kitty gained another close friend when she met Doug Ramsey, a fellow student in Stevie Hunter's dance class with whom she shared an affinity for computers. Doug's death on a mission with the New Mutants would prove to be the first of many personal losses Kitty would suffer.\n\nAfter a visit to her recently divorced father, Carmen, Kitty learned that he had become involved with the Japanese Yakuza and followed him to Japan where she was captured and put under the mental control of Ogun, the martial arts master who had once been her teammate Wolverine's teacher. Using Kitty's body, Ogun attempted to kill Wolverine but failed. Wolverine then taught Kitty to become skilful enough in the martial arts to combat Ogun, and together they managed to exorcise Ogun's spirit. During the course of this adventure, Kitty took to calling herself Shadowcat.\n\nWhile Colossus was away on Battleworld during what was to be called the Secret Wars, he became infatuated with an alien healer named Zsaji. Upon returning to Earth, he admitted his disloyalty to Kitty, severing their romance.\n\nDuring the massacre of the underground community of mutants known as the Morlocks by the team of superhuman mutant assassins the Marauders, Kitty was injured by an energy spear hurled by the Marauder called Harpoon that adversely affected her powers. Unable to regain her solidity, Kitty was saved by the combined efforts of the European dictator Doctor Doom and his arch-rival, Reed Richards of the team of superhuman adventurers known as the Fantastic Four. However, she could now only maintain a solid form through concentration.\n\nAfter witnessing the apparent death of the X-Men, Kitty helped form the British-based super-team Excalibur. During an inter-dimensional adventure, Kitty became separated from her teammates and, returning to her own Earth, she decided to give up the life of a costumed adventurer and attend college. However, unaccustomed as she was to the British educational system, Kitty was forced to enroll in St. Searle’s School for Girls. After helping save the school from closure, Kitty rejoined her recently returned teammates.\n\nMonths later, Kitty learned that Illyana was dying from the deadly mutant-killing Legacy Virus, a disease that targeted mutants. Kitty was present when Illyana finally succumbed to the disease, unaware that the young mutant's death bonded the Soulsword to her. Eventually the arcane magic's of the sword began to corrupt Kitty, and she surrendered the weapon to her then teammate Daytripper who in turn gave it to her mother, the gypsy sorceress Margali Szardos.\n\nSoon after, Excalibur was approached by the clandestine organization known as Black Air for assistance on a mission to the island nation of Genosha. They were assigned a liaison in Pete Wisdom, an uncouth British mutant who regularly clashed with the outspoken Kitty. The pair eventually overcame their initial impressions of one another and fell in love. Wisdom even resigned from Black Air and joined Excalibur to be with Kitty.\n\nLater, Kitty was recruited by the international law enforcement agency S.H.I.E.L.D. to repair the computer system of their flying headquarters. Kitty discovered the problem was due to Ogun’s spirit having infiltrated the computer system, and with the aid of Wolverine, she managed to purge Ogun's presence. During this time, Kitty was attracted to a S.H.I.E.L.D. intern her own age, and this made her begin to doubt her relationship with Wisdom. Soon after, she broke off their relationship.\n\nKitty remained a member of Excalibur until it disbanded whereupon she rejoined the X-Men. Soon after, an incident in Genosha caused Kitty to develop a rebellious attitude, reflected by her cutting her hair short, her more ferocious combat technique, and her taking to wielding one of Wolverine's broken bone claws in battle.\n\nWhen Colossus sacrificed his life to release a cure for the Legacy Virus, his body was supposedly cremated, and Kitty scattered the ashes over his Russian farmland home. Mourning the loss of her old friend, and trying to live a normal life, Kitty left the X-men. She enrolled in the Robert A. Heinlein School for Engineering and Astrophysics in Chicago on a full scholarship, yet chose to live off campus and began working as a bartender for her neighbor at his establishment, the Belles of Hell. Kitty found herself unable to escape the ever-prevalent prejudice of humans, and she soon clashed with members of a student anti-mutant organization named Purity. Kitty was put on probation and was forced to attend mandatory counseling. During this time, Kitty faced her most difficult loss when she learned her father was amongst those killed in an attack on Genosha.\n\nKitty's battle against Purity continued after the organization attempted to frame her for the sabotage of a research experiment. A student meeting was called to debate the banning of either Purity or mutants from campus, but discussions were cut short by an attack by a new breed of mutant-hunting robotic Sentinels which were destroyed by Kitty with the help of former New Mutant Karma and Genoshan exchange student Shola Inkosi.\n\nKitty was later abducted by the mutant-hating Reverend Stryker to help expose the technological threat of the mutant retreat known as Mount Haven and its mysterious leader, Reverend Paul. Together, Stryker and Kitty discovered that Paul was an artificial intelligence who had killed the human townspeople and used microbial machines called nanites to transform the minds of the mutant residents from organic matter into cybernetic computers linked to his central consciousness. When Storm's team of X-Men arrived to find Kitty, Paul sought to transform them as well. Stryker attempted to use Kitty's power to disrupt electronics to destroy Paul, but he failed and Paul responded by transferring his consciousness into a global network. In an effort to safeguard his kind from Paul’s threat, Stryker merged with him in an attempt to teach him about humanity, and the town of Haven was buried by a volcanic eruption.\n\nSoon after, Kitty assisted Storm’s team against the threat of mutant predator Elias Bogan. After Bogan was defeated, Kitty accompanied the team back to the mansion and was asked to remain as a member of Cyclops’ restructured X-Men. Peter Rasputin was discovered to be alive, his body secretly been stolen and resuscitated by Ord, an alien who had learned that an Earth mutant would be responsible for destroying his world. Kitty found Peter shortly before the X-Men's final battle with Ord, after which he rejoined the X-Men. After many years apart, Kitty and Peter reignited their romance.",

Unlike other hunters, he typically disdained the use of guns or bow and arrows preferring to take down large dangerous animals with his bare hands even though he often made elaborate preparations to weaken a quarry before hand. He also used a mystical serum to give him similar strength to Spider-Man, but even without the serum he was a threat to the wall-crawler. However, Kraven's continual underestimation of the superhero's resourcefulness made him a frustrating quarry.For a time, he gave up hunting Spider-Man, but his manipulative lover, Calypso Ezili, tricked him into believing Spider-Man set his caged animals free. Goading Kraven into resuming his pursuit, both she and Kraven were arrested. Convinced he would never be worthy of Calypso's love until he humbled Spider-Man, Kraven once again hunted Spider-Man. This time, Calypso muted Spider-Man's spider-sense, while the two battled. When Kraven realized Calypso had drugged Spider-Man with a hallucinogenic dart, he stopped the fight out of honor. The police captured the two again.After numerous battles in which Kraven was bested by the Wall Crawler, he finally defeated Spider-Man by shooting him and burying him for what would be his last hunt. He then donned Spider-Man's black costume and set out to prove that he was a greater Spider-Man than Spidey himself. He hunted down and defeated the creature known as Vermin who previously was only able to be defeated after Spider-Man enlisted the help of Captain America.The still living Spider-Man, who had actually been shot with a tranquilizer dart, clawed his way out from the grave and attacked Kraven but the hunter did not retaliate. Believing that he had regained his honor, Kraven released Vermin onto the streets. Spider-Man pursued Vermin while the deranged Kraven took his own life. Years later while Spider-Man was meeting with Al Kravinoff in a villains bar, Kraven reappears greyer but still alive.",

      "biography": "Mutant Colin McKay was seven when the crimelord Vixen had him kidnapped from his home outside Edinburgh. Escaping, he hid in a derelict factory on the shores of Loch Daemon, where, scared and lonely, he chanced upon the robotic Widget, making an instant friend. When the Vixen’s men followed, Widget sent Colin through a portal to another reality. Colin re-appeared on the ice plains of Ee’rath (Earth-148) and was taken to the exiled Royal Household of Queen Ai'sha, recently deposed by the evil mage Necrom. The benevolent witch-queen entrusted Colin to the mystic Zz'ria, who trained him as a warrior. Over the next twenty years, an increasingly leonine Colin became known as Kylun while developing his mutant talent for sound mimicry and pledging his heart to the sorceress Princess Sa'tneen, Ai'sha's daughter. Fearing the queen’s growing army, Necrom launched a surprise attack. Most were slain or captured; badly wounded, Kylun was left for dead. Recovering, he rescued Sa’tneen and they rallied an army, gradually driving the tyrant’s men back to the Dark Citadel, Necrom’s last stronghold. Penetrating this bastion, the lovers confronted Necrom, who attacked them with the zombified remains of their world’s greatest heroes, Excalibur. Sa’tneen neutralized the zombies by attacking Necrom, who killed her. She died in the arms of Kylun, who pursued the fleeing Necrom through a door, emerging in the lighthouse of Earth-616’s Excalibur team. Mistaking Nightcrawler for a demon, Kylun attacked him, but realized his mistake after his mystic blades proved unable to hurt the virtuous Nightcrawler. Widget’s arrival confirmed that Kylun had returned to his own Earth, though the time-rate differential between worlds meant only a year had passed since his departure, and that Necrom had arrived there a month earlier. Kylun teamed with Excalibur to fight Necrom, his blades proving to be one of the few effective weapons against the mage. After Necrom’s defeat, Kylun elected to stay with the team, fighting the time-manipulating assassin Sidestep and the early X-Men (or alternate dimensional counterparts), and helping to investigate the Crazy Gang’s bizarre Wonderland. Still brooding over his lost love, Kylun returned to Scotland in search of his family, but on his parents’ doorstep, before he could ring the doorbell, he was assaulted and kidnapped by Warpie agents of R.C.X. (the Resources Control Executive). Taken to their base, Cloud Nine, he and other similarly abducted Excalibur allies were held in stasis until Nightcrawler freed them. Back with Excalibur, he helped the extra-dimensional warrior Khaos defeat the evil Ghath, traveled to Earth-811 to assist its surviving heroes in overthrowing the ruling Sentinel regime, and joined in trying to rescue his teammate Cerise after she was apprehended for war crimes by the Shi'ar. Finally locating his parents, Kylun left Excalibur to move back in with them. He later attended the Otherworld wedding of his teammates Captain Britain (Brian Braddock) and Meggan.",

      "biography": "Yuriko Oyama is the daughter of Kenji Oyama, a former Japanese kamikaze pilot during World War II whose face was horribly scarred in a failed suicide attack on an American battleship. Later becoming the head of Oyama Heavy Industries, Kenji had Yuriko and her two brothers privately tutored by Marcy Stryker, wife of an American soldier named William Stryker. Kenji felt much shamed by his failure decades earlier, and as a result he ultimately scarred the faces of his three children in a ritual design. Becoming the criminal scientist Lord Dark Wind, Kenji developed a means for bonding the virtually indestructible metal Adamantium to human bone, a procedure he hoped to use in creating an army of super-soldiers for Japan. However, his notes were stolen, and it took him years to rediscover the process.Growing to despise post-war Japanese civilization, Lord Dark Wind had the then-crippled assassin Bullseye brought to his island off the Japanese coast. There, Dark Wind replaced some of Bullseye's broken bones with Adamantium substitutes, hoping that in return Bullseye would assassinate Japan’s minister of trade for him. Arriving in Japan intent on recapturing Bullseye, the blind costumed crimefighter Daredevil encountered Yuriko who sought vengeance on her father, both for scarring her and for the deaths of her brothers, who had perished in Lord Dark Wind’s service. Moreover, the young man Yuriko loved, Kira, served in Dark Wind’s private army, and she did not want her father to cause him harm. After Yuriko guided Daredevil to her father’s private island, Bullseye escaped and Yuriko herself slew Lord Dark Wind just as he was about to kill Daredevil.Following Daredevil’s departure, Kira committed suicide in despair over Dark Wind’s death. The shock of Kira’s death radically altered Yukio’s outlook on life, and she resolved to carry on her father’s work. Yuriko became convinced that the mutant adventurer Wolverine had gained his Adamantium-laced skeleton by means of the process stolen from her father years earlier. Garbed as a female samurai and calling herself Lady Deathstrike, Yuriko led a number of her father’s warriors to Canada where they confronted Wolverine, seeking to retrieve his Adamantium skeleton for study. She was defeated by Wolverine’s long-time friend Heather Hudson, who had adopted the costumed identity of Vindicator in her role as leader of the Canadian super-team Alpha Flight.Having failed to defeat Wolverine, Lady Deathstrike resolved to better fight him on his own terms and so struck a deal with Donald Pierce, the renegade White King of the elitist Hellfire Club, who had formed a band of cyborg mercenaries named the Reavers. Pierce had the extradimensional being Spiral transform Deathstrike into a cyborg, healing her facial scars in the process. Now possessing superhuman strength and Adamantium claws to rival Wolverine’s own, she led three other cyborgs in Pierce's employ – former Hellfire Club soldiers Cole, Macon, and Reese - in an attack on Wolverine, only to again meet defeat. Now interested only in vengeance, Deathstrike later joined Pierce and his Reavers in an ambush on Wolverine in a remote town in the Australian outback. Capturing him, they crucified him on an X-shaped cross and left him to die. Wolverine was rescued by the young mutant named Jubilee, and after a brief clash with the Reavers the pair escaped. Believing Wolverine had fled to the mutant research facility on Muir Island, the Reavers arrived and clashed with both a rag-tag group of X-Men and the government-sponsored Freedom Force team. After both sides suffered casualties, the tide of battle began to turn against them and the Reavers retreated.Later hoping to succeed alone after her failures with a team, Deathstrike had the Reavers’ former ally, the mutant aborigine Gateway, teleport her to Wolverine’s location. At that moment, Wolverine had traveled back in time to Spain in 1937 thus Deathstrike was also sent into the past. Caught in a skirmish during the Spanish Civil War, the pair subsequently fought their way through temporal distortion to return to the present, their battle unresolved.  In a subsequent confrontation, Deathstrike learned that the self-styled mutant master of magnetism, Magneto, had forcibly removed the Adamantium from Wolverine’s body. As a result, she lost interest in her quest and returned to the Reavers in search of purpose.After an attack on the Reavers by giant robotic Sentinels summoned from the future by the time-traveling mutant villain Trevor Fitzroy, Pierce rebuilt the Reavers and led them in capturing Milo Thurman, a former government employee who possessed incredible natural prophetic abilities. Pierce intended to transform Thurman into a cyborg Reaver under his control, but his plan was opposed by Thurman’s former lover, the mutant mercenary Domino. As Deathstrike battled Domino, Pierce downloaded almost 60% of Thurman's consciousness into his own mind before the Reavers’ base was destroyed.\n\nLater striking out on her own, Lady Deathstrike once again clashed with Wolverine but was possessed by the spirit of another of his nemeses, Ogun. Eventually abandoned by the spirit once it had learned from her how to infiltrate cybernetic systems, Deathstrike subsequently allied with the Japanese terrorist group Strikeforce Ukiyoe and clashed with the super-soldier Captain America following his return from an extradimensional exile. She next found herself targeted by Prime Sentinels, mutant-hunting cyborgs under the command of the time-traveling villain Stryfe. Although not a mutant herself, Deathstrike unknowingly carried within her cybernetic programming the control codes for the more powerful Omega-class Sentinels. With the help of Wolverine and his teammates in the X-Men, Deathstrike defeated Stryfe and his forces. Despite their shared victory, Deathstrike’s dislike for Wolverine endured, and she was subsequently recruited by Wolverine’s arch-nemesis, the feral mutant Sabretooth, to assist him in striking at Wolverine’s loved ones in exchange for valuable information. Deathstrike, alongside the Russian super-soldier Omega Red, crippled Wolverine’s friend Yukio and abducted his ward Amiko. Having obtained what he wanted, Sabretooth subsequently double-crossed Deathstrike and Omega Red, cheating them out of the information he had promised them.Lady Deathstrike later went to the aid of her former associate William Stryker, who had since become a minister and led an anti-mutant crusade that resulted in his imprisonment over the murderous actions of his Purifier soldiers. Breaking him out of government custody, Deathstrike gave him access to the resources of Oyama Heavy Industries. In the course of aiding Stryker in his efforts, she fell under the control of Paul, a sentient computer entity who sought to protect the community of mutants living in Mount Haven. Under Paul’s control, Deathstrike fought both Stryker and the X-Men, once more dueling Wolverine and, ironically, meeting better success under Paul’s control than she ever had on her own. In the course of one clash, Deathstrike was buried beneath collapsing rubble, but when the X-Man Bishop investigated he found only her severed cybernetic arm.Recently, Deathstrike was responsible for severing the legs of the mutant hero Sunfire.",

      "biography": "After Layla Miller's parents died in a car accident, she was sent to New York's St. Joan Orphanage.  While there, Layla manifested mutant powers, growing horns &amp; breathing fire, frightening &amp; alienating the human orphans.  When the delusional Scarlet Witch rewrote reality to make mutants the dominant species (Reality-58163, the \"House of M\", Layla's parents were resurrected, &amp; a normal-looking Layla now had new powers, enabling her to remember the old world &amp; to restore the memories of others.  Dr. Strange(Stephan Strange) has theorized this new power was the Scarlet Witch's subconscious providing a way to reverse her actions.  Despite knowing that restoring the conventional Reality-616 would destroy her idyllic new life, Layla unlocked numerous heroes' memories; they confronted the Scarlet Witch, who restored reality to normal but depowered most of Earth's mutants at the same time, an event later dubbed \"M-Day.\"  Layla awoke back in the orphanage, seemingly no longer a mutant, but now aware of probable futures &amp; how to promote one over another.  With this foreknowledge, she ran away &amp; approached mutant detective agency X-Factor, concealing her motives, Layla helped them investigate Singularity Investigations &amp; its similarly prescient head, Damian Tryp.  He was recreating the mutant-killing Legacy Virus to prevent a future where repowered mutants destroyed humanity (Earth-6124), but Layla's presence proved a random factor Tryp could not anticipate, &amp; X-Factor destroyed Singularity Investigations.  Layla's prescience often unsettled her teammates, especially [[Jamie Madrox Multiple Man, who the 13-year-old Layla claimed was her future husband.  Regarding Scarlet Witch's brother Quicksilver as dangerous &amp; generally despising him, Layla tried to arrange his death, but failed because he possessed a small portion of his sister's chaos power, making him unpredictable; depowered by M-Day, he had gained new powers from stolen Terrigen crystals, but he lost these abilities thanks in part to Layla's manipulations.Tryp's silent partner, the Isolationist (Josef Huber), plotted to slaughter Earth's remaining mutants; aware of Layla, he had Nicole,a robotic simulacrum of a young, depowered mutant, infiltrate X-Factor, its chaotic randomizing generator disrupting  Layla's foresight.  Nicole tried to murder Layla, but an unhinged Quicksilver rescued her, claiming he did so in hopes of killing Layla himself.  Escaping him, Layla warned X-Factor in time to thwart Huber, &amp; lured Nicole into the path of an oncoming train.Layla foresaw a terrifying future, where she would need to permit herself to be held in a mutant internment camp for the sake of achieving her overall goals.  The birth of a new mutant, the first since M-Day, triggered hope that it might be possible to restore mutantkind, &amp; Madrox sent two of his duplicates to gather information from alternate futures where this restoration succeeded.  Layla jumped in on one of the time jumps, ending up 80 years ahead in a world where a mutant/human race war had concluded with mutants in camps (Earth-1191).  Incarcerated, she &amp; the Madrox duplicate learned that the newborn in their own time had started the war, &amp; Layla slew the duplicate so that his knowledge would be transmitted back to Earth-616.  Though displaced from her own time, Layla soon communicated through the timelines to Madrox herself, somehow informing him that their teammate Siryn was pregnant with his child.  Escaping the mutant camp, Layla worked with Ruby Summers building a rebellion against the anti-mutant regime.  When she was 21, Layla found a means to bring Jamie Madrox to her from Earth-616, though from his perspective less than a year had passed since Layla had been lost in the future.",

      "biography": "For every yin, there is a yang. Gamma radiation released Bruce Banner’s subconscious rage, giving it physical form as the Hulk, an embodiment of strength. So perhaps it was high school dropout Sam Sterns’ desire to be more like his scientist brother Phillip that caused him to transform into the hyper-intelligent Leader when he too was exposed to gamma radiation. Working as a laborer in a government-owned chemical research facility in the Nevada desert, Sam was caught in an explosion when a cylinder of radioactive waste he was moving unexpectedly blew up. Recovering in the hospital, he discovered he had an insatiable thirst for knowledge and rapidly read through every book he could lay his hands on. Weeks later, Sam underwent a physical transformation as well, when his skin turned green and his skull expanded upwards. Calling himself the Leader, he organized a spy ring to steal scientific secrets, only to find the Hulk an impediment to his plans. Desiring to study his foe, he sent first the Chameleon and then synthetic Humanoids to capture the green behemoth, starting what would become a long-standing feud between them. Time and again, the Leader would use others to battle his foe, employing the Rhino, the Glob, Jackdaw and Arsenal, and even working with General Thunderbolt Ross on one occasion. One time he forced the Hulk to raid the Watcher’s home in the Blue Area of the Moon for the advanced technology within. The Hulk successfully retrieved the Ultimate Machine (a.k.a. the Globe of Ultimate Knowledge), but when the Leader accessed the millions of years’ worth of information within the Machine, even his advanced mind was overwhelmed and he collapsed to the ground, seemingly dead. Another plan saw him impersonate Glenn Talbot and take over Gamma Base using robot doubles, planning to similarly replace the President and Vice-President when they inspected the facility the following day.A lab accident later left the Leader paralyzed for a prolonged period. During this time he initially used a mind-controlled Rhino to do his bidding. Later he entered into a wager with Kurrgo, the “Master of Planet X,” where they pitted the Thing and the Hulk in battle against one another, with the winner gaining the right to use both “champions” in their future machinations. Instead the champions destroyed Kurrgo’s ship. The Leader finally regained the use of his limbs by deliberately reverting back to the form of Sterns, whose amnesiac form then followed subconscious orders to infiltrate Gamma Base where he exposed himself to radiation to transform back into the Leader. This usurping of the Base, like the previous time, was brought to an end by the combined forces of the Hulk and Doc Samson.Many of the Leader’s schemes have involved plots to transform others into gamma-mutates under his control. One time, on the pretext of seeking a cure for the Hulk, he duped Dr. Rikki Keegan, a school friend of Banner’s, into obtaining blood samples from his foe. He used these to contaminate Manhattan’s water supply, causing a “Green Flu” which would mutate those it didn’t kill. However, Keegan mutated into a Leader-like being more powerful than her creator, and in order to prevent her from telekinetically wrecking all his equipment, the Leader was forced to administer the antidote, which was then used to cure the rest of the victims. Subsequently he traveled back in time to Earth’s primeval past to alter mankind’s evolution so that all humanity would become gamma people. This latter plan brought him into conflict with the Avengers as well as his old adversary, and he apparently plunged to his death into a prehistoric volcano. However thanks to a hidden teleportation device, he managed to survive.Eventually the Leader’s mutation destabilized, and he reverted to his human form. Seeking to regain his heightened intellect, he drained gamma radiation from Rick Jones who at that point was suffering from Hulk-like transformations. Stern became the Leader again, albeit with a new appearance and a psychic link to Jones. Using new operatives Half-Life, Rock, and Redeemer, the Leader lured the gray Hulk to Middletown, Arizona, where he detonated a gamma bomb while the Hulk was holding it above his head. Believing his enemy dead, the Leader gathered together the handful of Middletown survivors and formed them into the Riot Squad. Sometime later, after discovering the Hulk had survived, the Leader assisted him in battling Sterns’ brother, now the superhuman known as Madman. The Leader created a town called Freehold, an isolated community hidden beneath the Columbia ice-fields of Alberta, Canada, and filled it with people who were dying of radiation poisoning. The Leader claimed that Freehold would form the basis of a new society after pollution and war wiped out the rest of humanity, but in actuality he used some of the radiation victims for experiments, as when he created the cyborgs known as the Headshop. When Hydra threatened his city, the Leader sought the Pantheon’s aid and struck a deal with Agamemnon, leader of that organization. Agamemnon sent the Pantheon’s newest recruit, the Hulk, to “help”. But Hydra’s attack coincided with another event; the Leader, linked emphatically to Rick Jones since regaining his powers, was being affected by the grief Jones felt over the recent death of Marlo Chandler, his girlfriend. The Leader approached Rick and offered to restore her to life, using the power of Soul Man, one of his followers. While the Leader was honest in his intent to restore Marlo, he also planned to use the chance to analyze Soul Man’s powers so that he could become immortal and invincible. However, he apparently underwent an epiphany while witnessing Marlo’s resurrection, just seconds before the Hulk, who had dealt with the Hydra forces attacking Freehold, came looking to settle old scores. Apparently fatally wounded when the Hulk used him as a shield to stop Redeemer’s bullets, the Leader appeared to die minutes later in a massive explosion.The Leader survived the explosion in non-corporeal form. He apparently controlled Omnibus, one of the Freehold gamma mutates, and created a terrorist organization, “The Alliance,” with which he sought to destabilize the world and plunge it into war, only to have the Hulk thwart him once again. The people of Freehold, refusing to believe Omnibus’ claims that the Leader made him do it, exiled him to die in the snowy wastes. Still later, when Banner was dying of ALS, the Hulk received a mental summons that drew him out into the desert. There he found the Leader who had re-formed his body using cells from dead animals and local flora. Sterns informed his old enemy that he had gained enlightenment and was about to transcend this mortal plane. After giving the Hulk the cure for Banner’s illness, he asked his former nemesis to witness his ascension. However, something appeared to go wrong at the critical juncture and the Leader’s new body exploded. A subsequent vision of Banner’s in which the Leader begged for his help suggests that he may have encountered something quite unpleasant wherever his mind ended up.What appeared to be a tragedy was only a temporary setback as the Leader returned in a new body and made himself a home in Gammaworld where he encountered Hulk's former allies, the Warbound. Wanting the Oldpower of Hiroim, Leader used the townspeople to create a new monster called Horde to battle them. Ultimately, Hiroim sacrificed himself to stop the Leader, and the Oldpower was kept out of his grasp.The Leader would soon return to plans of revenge against all those who wronged him, especially the Hulk. His sporadic allies in the Intelligencia were eager to help, and utilizing a plot thought out by the murderous M.O.D.O.K., they were well on their way to achieving victory. Leader was the first to hear of a creation of a Red Hulk to be the Intelligencia's greatest asset in the coming war, but a bitter betrayal, and the death of General Ross put them at odds with both Hulks. Even though the Leader founded the Intelligencia, he is content to let M.O.D.O.K. share the spotlight so long as their ultimate goal is achieved. Pitting his formidable mind against that of his greatest foe's alter ego, the Leader was impressed at how clever Banner was to appear to counter every move the Intelligencia made. In the end, it was the Leader who would have the last laugh as he laid the perfect trap, and Banner was captured and incapacitated along with the other great minds of the world who could have put an end to his evil schemes.",

      "biography": "When mutant abilities manifest, their arrival can have dangerous, demoralizing, or catastrophic results. This is why Charles Xavier dedicated his life to helping young mutants accept and develop their powers, aiding them in finding their own place in the world. Unfortunately for David Haller, an Omega-level mutant, his complex abilities have made his life a whirlwind since he was a child. He also just happens to be Xavier’s own son—something the Professor was unaware of for quite some time.\n\nHaller has been through many phases, but his dissociative identity disorder means he’s also wrestled with a variety of personalities, each with their own abilities and dispositions, hence the name Legion.\n\nThe Making of a Mutant\n\nYears ago, mutant psychic Charles Xavier had a brief affair with an Israeli woman, Gabrielle Haller. Unaware Gabrielle was pregnant, he left Israel a short time later. Haller concealed their son’s existence from Xavier, later becoming the Israeli ambassador to Great Britain and marrying Daniel Shomron. After moving to Paris for Gabrielle to serve in the Israeli diplomatic service, their home was invaded by an anti-Semitic assassination team, who killed Shomron before ten-year-old David’s eyes. The terror catalyzed his mutant powers, which he used to destroy the assassins’ minds.\n\nWhile doing so, he unwittingly psychically connected with their thoughts and emotions as they died, shattering David’s mind into multiple personas (and giving him dissociative identity disorder) and rendering him catatonic. The consciousness of the assassins’ leader, Jemail Karami, was absorbed into David’s mind. After years of being merged, Karami’s consciousness separated from David’s, remaining trapped within David’s psyche, but gaining control of David’s telepathic power. Using this power, Karami learned of David’s gentleness and gained an understanding of sympathy and goodness by reading the minds of Gabrielle and others. Seeking to restore David’s mind to normalcy, Karami began reintegrating these personas into David’s core persona, which was frozen as a ten-year-old desperately in need of parental care.\n\nWhen some of the personas resisted—most notably the swaggering Jack Wayne (commanding David’s telekinesis) and the temperamental Cyndi (controlling David’s pyrokinesis)—a war erupted within David’s mindscape. The multiple personas eventually called themselves Legion.",

While Lila was forced into blood sports, Spyder coveted her teleportation talent and secretly arranged her escape, forcing her owner into bankruptcy so he could cheaply claim her contract. Spyder did not relocate the elusive Lila for some time. Lila traveled the galaxy, making an abandoned Dyson Sphere her home while becoming a master thief and a talented musician. Acquiring a team of supporting musicians and roadies both alien and human (employing image inducers as disguises when necessary)&lt; Lila became a famous singer on and off Earth. When the embittered Lila attempted to sell Earth herself, drummer Phil Hovannes betrayed her to the Vrakanin Charasulla, whose attack on Lila was opposed when the New Mutants intervened. Hovannes was killed, the theft was stopped, and Lila became romantically involved with Sam Guthrie (Cannonball). Lila allied with the New Mutants repeatedly thereafter: in locating the Shadow King’s Gladiators (introducing her to Alison Blaire, Dazzler, who briefly became Lila’s keyboardist and back-up singer), when Lila was attacked non Earth by Zyndarians she’d once robbed, and when Spyder kidnapped her. She also aided the alien Snaarl, attacked by the extra-dimensional Zxaxz when his band, Cataclysm, opened for Lila. After recovering from teleporting into a sun’s corona with several planet-destroying aliens, Lila helped the X-Men, the Starjammers, and Deathbird thwart a Skrull takeover of the Shi’ar government. Treturning to Earth, Lila met an amnesiac Dazzler and was pulled into a rebellion on Mojoworld. Lila and Cannonball amicably ended their relationship; and, now wanted by Earth’s authorities after aiding Sam and his X-Force team against S.H.I.E.L.D., Lila returned to interstellar touring. However, the alien thief Jornik looted Lila’s Dyson Sphere, selling much of her stolen wealth. When the K’lanti race came in search of their twice-stolen harmonium, Lila and former bodyguard/friend Guido Carosella (Strong Guy) recovered it, but Guido was left comatose. The traumatized Lila retreated to performing only in intimate Earth venues, and when Guido recovered they resumed traveling together. After stopping a war between the Jorken and Krant races, the pair reassembled Lila’s band and returned to the space ways. Lila now lives two lives: one traveling the stars with her band, and one on Earth where she and Sam Guthrie have rekindled their quiet romantic affair.",

      "biography": "A member of the royal family of the extraterrestrial Shi'ar Empire, Princess-Majestrix Lilandra Neramani was born on the Shi'ar homeworld known as the Aerie. The eldest heir to the Shi'ar throne was Lilandra's older sister, Cal'syee.  However, for her crime of killing her mother and one of her sisters, Cal'syee was denied the throne and exiled into space. Cal'syee's younger brother D'ken was appointed majestor (emperor) instead.Lilandra, D'ken's younger sister, served as Grand Admiral of the Shi'ar Imperial Guard, a cadre of super-powered beings that enforced Shi'ar law throughout the Empire, when she learned of her brother's insane plan to make use of the incredible power trapped within the M'kraan Crystal to grant himself omniscience. The Crystal itself was an interdimensional nexus leading to another dimension full of neutron stars consisting of super-dense matter that created extraordinary gravitational forces. D'ken was blind to the true danger that the Crystal presented, and mistakenly believed he could control its unleashed power. Lilandra opposed his plans in the Shi'ar High Council, and D'ken accused her of treason and had her arrested. D'ken then leaked word that Lilandra had attempted to kill him and usurp the throne, and civil war broke out across the Empire as a result. D'ken had Lilandra held captive aboard the Imperial Flagship whilst she awaited execution, but she escaped and fled in a small scoutship.Lilandra sought help in stopping her brother from destroying the universe, and suddenly saw an image in her mind of the telepathic Earthman named Charles Xavier, who at that time was using his powers to unite much of the collective will of Earth humanity to create enough psychic force to fend off the invading alien Z'nox.  Somehow, subconsciously, Xavier had found a kindred spirit in Lilandra, and this caused a psychic link to form between the two. Knowing of Earth and its large number of superhuman beings, Lilandra traveled there for help. She finally met Xavier, who used his powers to quickly teach her English, but she was soon captured by Davan Shakari, an agent of D'ken's, who transported her through hyperspace to the world of the M'kraan Crystal. Xavier's team of superhuman mutant adventurers known as the X-Men followed Shakari in time to witness the power of the Crystal unleashed. The universe was saved from annihilation by Phoenix, in actuality a primal force of the cosmos that had assumed the form of the X-Man Jean Grey, and D'ken was sent incurably insane and almost catatonic as a result.The X-Men returned to Earth and were joined by Lilandra who was awaiting the decision of the Shi'ar High Council as to whether she should become empress, despite her having rebelled against D'ken.  Lilandra and Xavier fell in love, and following the seemed death of the X-Men in Antarctica, Lilandra received word that the Council had ruled in her favor. Lilandra and Xavier left for the Shi'ar Throneworld together, whereupon arrival Lilandra became majestrix and Xavier became her royal consort.After a time, Xavier returned to Earth on realizing the danger that the Phoenix posed. After Phoenix went insane and destroyed both a Shi'ar starship and the homeworld of the D'bari, who were part of the Shi'ar Empire, Lilandra demanded that the menace of the Phoenix be ended forever to safeguard the cosmos. Having familiarized himself with Shi'ar law, Xavier demanded Arin'nn Haelar - a trial by combat - to decide the fate of Phoenix, whom he mistakenly believed to be Jean Grey. The X-Men clashed with the Imperial Guard, but during the encounter Phoenix committed suicide in order to prevent herself from wreaking further destruction. Out of respect, Lilandra later attended Phoenix's funeral.Later, Lilandra's older sister Cal'syee, now known as Deathbird, sought to regain the throne that she believed was rightfully hers. To that end, Deathbird allied herself with the treacherous Shi'ar High Council member Lord Samédàr and the alien races of the Brood and the Badoon in an attempted coup. The Brood were defeated with the help of the X-Men, but Deathbird succeeded in usurping the throne. Lilandra fled into exile with the Starjammers, and the Empire came under Deathbird's tyrannical rule.During her time in exile, Lilandra found that she still commanded a great deal of respect from the leaders of other starfaring races, and thus was able to become the principal organizer of the trial of Earthman Reed Richards, better known as Mr. Fantastic of the superhuman costumed adventurers the Fantastic Four, for saving the life of the world-eater known only as Galactus.Lilandra remained with the Starjammers as Empress-in-absentia, fighting to reclaim her throne.  However, Deathbird had consolidated her base of power, and Lilandra was now considered a rebel.  Soon after, Lilandra sensed over the psychic link that she shared with Xavier that he was in great danger as a result of overexerting himself after receiving massive injuries. Lilandra returned to Earth to take him aboard the Starjammer's ship where the advanced medical technology there fully healed him to the point where Xavier could walk once more. However, they were unable to return Xavier to Earth as the ship's hyperspatial drive had been damaged and the Shi'ar stargates were all now heavily defended in an attempt to capture Lilandra. Together, Lilandra and Xavier remained with the Starjammers and continued the fight against Deathbird's oppression.Months later, the Starjammers learned on a raided space transporter that Deathbird was searching for a mythical power called \"Phalkon\". Lilandra confirmed the myth about this power source, and the Starjammers beat Deathbird to the map with its location. Deathbird was able to kidnap her sister Lilandra in turn, hoping to use her as bait to draw out the Starjammers, but Lilandra fought back against her sister. Lilandra would have killed Deathbird if the Starjammers not beamed her out. As it turned out, the mythical Phalkon was actually the Phoenix Force, currently wielded by the alternate future daughter of Jean Grey named Rachel Summers. Together, the Starjammers and the British super-team Excalibur defeated Deathbird and her Imperial Guard. As word spread about the Starjammers' victory, it inspired rebellions across the Shi'ar Empire.Much later, the intergalactic teleporter Lila Cheney transported the X-Men to the Shi'ar Empire at the behest of Deathbird in time to see Lilandra regain her throne. Not all was as it seemed, however, as in reality a group of Warskrulls, using technology to allow them to duplicate superpowers, had captured and impersonated Xavier, using his telepathy to control Lilandra and the Imperial Guard. After the ruse was discovered by the X-Men and all the Warskrull impostors were exposed, Lilandra settled matters with Deathbird, discovering her sister did not want the throne anymore. During her time as ruling Shi'ar Majestrix, Deathbird had come to despise the responsibilities of maintaining the needs of an Empire as large as the Shi'ar's.It would not be long before the Shi'ar Empire would face their greatest challenge yet. Machinations by the Supreme Intelligence, a being that served as the depository of all the knowledge of the alien Kree, working in conjunction with the malicious Skrull Empire managed to bring about a war between the Kree and the Shi'ar. Subtly influenced by the Supreme Intelligence by means of advisors who were, in reality, members of the Skrull race, Lilandra ordered the retrieval of some Kree artifacts from which Shi'ar scientists created a Nega-Bomb. Despite intervention from the Avengers, a team of costumed superhuman champions from Earth, who revealed the presence of the Skrulls to Lilandra, the bomb was captured by a group of Skrulls and was subsequently detonated over the Kree homeworld of Hala, killing 90% of the Kree population. Lilandra was left with no recourse but to claim the remains of the Kree Empire in the name of the Shi'ar and appointed Deathbird as viceroy.On the eve of the ceremony that would see the Kree officially incorporated into the Shi'ar Empire, Lilandra had Xavier and some of the X-Men teleported to Hala, the Kree homeworld. There the X-Men uncovered a Kree rebellion, but although the dissident's leader helped them defuse a bomb that would have destroyed Hala's sun, Lilandra was still forced to arrest him, and the tension between legality and morality drove a wedge between herself and Xavier.Later, when she learned of the many Earth heroes that had sacrificed their lives to stop the malevolent psionic being named Onslaught, Lilandra dispatched eight members of the Imperial Guard to protect Earth, even though her own Empire was under attack by the techno-organic alien race known as the Phalanx at the time. Fortunately, the Guard's Praetor Gladiator sent the X-Men to help defeat the Phalanx, preventing Lilandra and her empire from being assimilated into the Phalanx collective.Soon after, the member of the Kree race known as Ronan the Accuser attempted to assassinate Lilandra by using the royal family of the Earth race known as the Inhumans as his assassins.  However, the attempt was foreseen by Delphos of the Imperial Guard, and instead of Lilandra it was the shape-shifting Guardsman known as Hobgoblin, posing as the Shi'ar Majestrix, who was killed.Lilandra's rule would again be tested when a meeting of the intergalactic council dubbed Earth as a threat to the entire cosmos, and it was deemed to turn the planet into an intergalactic prison.  Lilandra tried the best she could to prevent this, but her efforts were in vain and the plan was put into motion. Lilandra dispatched her aide, Cerise, to Earth to warn the X-Men whilst she herself sought out Xavier. Ultimately, Earth's superhuman champions overthrew their planet's captors and freed their world.Recently, Lilandra came under the mental possession of Cassandra Nova, the genetic twin of Professor Xavier who had usurped her brother's body. Whilst under Nova's control, Lilandra was forced to dispatch the Imperial Guard to kill the X-Men and also to plunge her Empire into Chaos. Nova then forced Lilandra to take her own life, but she was saved by X-Men members Cyclops and Xorn. The X-Men managed to convince the Guard of the true threat, and together they managed to defeat Nova and free Lilandra. However, the damage Nova caused to Lilandra's mind was great enough that Lilandra later attempted to assassinate Xavier, whom she still believed was Nova, in Mumbai, India. The attempt was foiled by members of the global search and rescue organization known as the X-Corporation. Lilandra's betrothal to Xavier was annulled, and she was returned to her people to recover.",

      "biography": "After a loveless, abusive, year-long prearranged marriage to Hungarian noblewoman Zofia, 15th-century nobleman Vlad Dracula banished Zofia and their infant daughter, Lilith. Zofia killed herself after paying the wizened Gypsy Gretchin to raise the child. Years later, the now vampiric Dracula slew Gretchin's son, Arni, and Gretchin magically transformed Lilith into an adult vampire, further empowering her to torment Dracula eternally. After many conflicts, Dracula impaled Lilith in the 20th century, but she was soon reborn. Lilith learned to control her vampiric lusts, targeting those deserving death, though when she spared loser Horace Morton Biggotty V she wondered if she had done him any favors. Lilith was destroyed by Quincy Harker and reborn through human host Angel O'Hara, whose father had killed her fiancé, and she lived a dual existence in Greenwich Village for a time. While Angel fell in love with writer Martin Gold, Lilith encountered the insane \"sex crime\" killer, drug dealers, the murdering \"Nobody Anybody Knows,\" Kallen Chemical Works, and disco king T.J. Novello and jealous girlfriend Della Fiorelli. When Dracula was turned human by Mephisto, he sought Lilith to make him a vampire anew, but she instead tried to kill him. Dracula became a vampire again, and Lilith sought out Gretchin's descendent Viktor Benzel, who separated Lilith and Angel. Lilith then attempted to destroy Dracula, who instead slew her lover Viktor; he then mocked her inability to kill him herself. While seeking Viktor's brother Karl, hoping to find a way to kill Dracula, she solved the murders of the insane gardener Siegfried. Lilith possessed X-Man Kitty Pryde in a failed effort against her father, but she died happily when the Montesi Formula later destroyed both her and Dracula; however, when Dracula was reborn, so was she. Consumed by bloodlust, she sought Brother Voodoo's aid, encountering Ghost Rider (Dan Ketch) and Scarecrow (Ebenezer Laughton), and then used the Zombie to bring her fresh blood for a vampire army, meeting defeat from Spider-Man and Hannibal King. Regaining control, Lilith employed Dr. Charles Seward and Anton Florescu to infect Dracula with a lethal virus. Though Dracula survived, Lilith was pleased that he had to sink to drinking the blood of a corpse to do so.",

      "biography": "Some trace Lilith to the Heavenly Hosts, where she and Samael, later \"Satan,\" rebelled and were cast out. On Earth, Lilith conceived the Mazikim by Adam but ultimately refused to be subservient and left him. When self-proclaimed angels slaughtered most of the Mazikim, Lilith vowed her line would dominate. Twenty millennia ago, Lilith survived the Great Cataclysm in Atlantis. A Sumerian god, she eventually withdrew as a storm demon to the desert beyond the Euphrates, abducting unbaptized children and visiting men in their dreams. Ruling mortal kingdoms, she conceived powerful children, including the demonic Lilin; her lovers included the angel Shemhazai, the fertility god Attis, and even, some say, the Judeo-Christian God. Lilith is believed to have spawned different races of vampires. Stories say she fought Gilgamesh circa 3000 B.C. and, over two millennia later, challenged Solomon, banisher of demons, including the Lilin. Supposedly, as the Queen of Sheba, Lilith conceived by Solomon. Decades later, Lilith bedeviled the prophet Elijah. When Rome fell over a millennium later, she allegedly ruled the ruins. In 12th century Asia, Lilith was trapped in a bottle by a midwife. A century later, Joseph della Reina thought to summon the Messiah by confronting Lilith and her latest demon consort, Ashmodei; no match for Lilith, Reina was transformed into a dog. In the 18th century, Lilith was challenged by Rabbi Elimelekh, who escaped unscathed. Some of her activities were perhaps in spirit form, for at some point Atlantean mages trapped her within a monstrous Leviathan (possibly Tiamat). Tales of her independence made her a heroine to some, with little idea of her history. In recent years, Lilith emerged from the Leviathan and gathered the Lilin against Ghost Rider and others. As war waged, Lilith directed one son, Bloodthirst, to possess Morbius, weakening their enemies. Eventually, the demon Zarathos was freed and manipulated into joining Lilith. The Lilin were ultimately re-banished, but Lilith remained, having conceived Zarathos's child. Lilith has since bedeviled Doctor Strange and his former protégés, the Witches (Jennifer Kale, Satana, Topaz). She has waited through all human history to claim Earth, and she can wait longer.",

      "biography": "Living Lightning is a licensed Super Hero and an attentive student who believes that innocents should be protected. He joins the Avengers after being a reluctant criminal and puts his electrical powers to good use by protecting the planet from world-ending threats.\n\nMIGUEL SANTOS\n\n\nCarlos Santos and his wife Maria believe in the American Dream, and immigrate to Los Angeles from Mexico to ensure their children would be born American citizens. A staunch patriot for his adopted country, he soon realizes that like all nations it was divided by internal hatreds, so Carlos joins the radical Legion of Living Lightning, accepting the group’s rhetoric that it would abolish war and bigotry once it seized control of the USA. He regales his son Miguel with tales of the Legion’s lofty goals, even confiding in the boy about the Legion’s namesake and ultimate weapon, the Living Lightning, a machine which generates devastating electrical bolts; Miguel dreams of joining the Legion too, but his parents insist he finish his schooling.\n\nWhile Miguel was still in his teens, a battle between the Legion and Bruce Banner, AKA Hulk, ends with the Living Lightning machine’s generator exploding, destroying the Legion’s Santa Ana Mountains’ base and killing many of their members, including Carlos. Despite his mother blaming the Legion for Carlos’ demise, Miguel continues to view them as heroes, vowing to personally continue their mission. He studies coded maps left behind by his father, eventually locating the ruined base, which he gains entry to using his father’s fingerprint glove. Hoping to salvage the Living Lightning machine, he reconnects severed cables, and suffers a massive electrical shock, which somehow transforms him into living electricity. Destroying the machine to ensure no one else could be similarly empowered, Miguel christens himself el Relampago Vivo, the Living Lightning, before setting off to test his new abilities.\n\nReports of a burning man flying over the city of Fullerton and starting fires drew the attention of the android Jim Hammond, AKA Human Torch, the West Coast Avengers, and criminal geneticist Dr. Demonicus, who had a hidden base nearby. While Demonicus covertly monitors proceedings, Miguel attacks the Torch and Avengers, until he is tricked into explosively grounding himself. Though his combaters believe him slain, the intrigued Demonicus secretly siphons Miguel’s dissipated energies into his base for study, reconstituting him into human form.\n\nDemonicus constructs a costume with three stabilizing units that prevent Miguel from spontaneously decomposing into random electrical impulses; with the threat of dissolution if he displeased the scientist, and figuring that he would be a wanted man for his Fullerton rampage, the initially reluctant Miguel agrees to join Demonicus’ Pacific Overlords, shortly before Demonicus raised the island Demonica from the ocean depths. However when Demonicus ordered the execution of unwilling Overlord Pele and the captive Scarlet Witch, Miguel rebelled, insisting he had not signed up to murder helpless women. The Avengers arrived moments later and attacked the Overlords; initially unsure which side to assist, Miguel decides he could not allow innocents to be endangered when Demonicus tries to use the Witch as a hostage, and turns on the Overlords, destroying Demonicus’ remote control for the stabilizing units before it could be used to deactivate them. The Avengers back down when the United Nations officially recognizes Demonica; Miguel departs the new nation with them, accepting an offer of Avengers membership from the Wasp while they were en route back to the United States.\n\n \n\nELECTRICAL PLAMA FORCE\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMiguel can transform his body into electrical plasma; in this form he can fly at sub-light speeds, generate a protective electrical aura strong enough to repel bullets, emit light flashes to blind or illuminate, and produce electrical blasts of up to 15 million volts. There appears to be no limit to how long he can safely remain in his electrical form, and while in this state he does not need to breathe and is immune to the rigors of outer space. He is insubstantial enough in this form to slip normal restraints or have objects pass through him, but he can be shorted out by exposure to water.\n\nHis costume’s stabilizing units prevent him from becoming stuck in this form and dissipating; they also regulate his top power level, but can be individually switched off to allow him access to greater limits, and if detached, the units carry sufficient residual charge to give a non-lethal shock; however he cannot switch off all the units without risking losing physical cohesion. In human form his more limited command of his body’s electrical energy is still sufficient to hurl lightning bolts or control electrical devices. He can also absorb electricity, though he risks overload if he absorbs too much without discharging the excess.\n\nMiguel has some experience with basic street-fighting techniques, as well as some combat training from his fellow Avengers. Furthermore, he is bilingual in Spanish and English.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nVILLAINOUS FOES\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhile Doctor Demonicus creates a stabilizing costume for Miguel to control his powers, he ultimately ends up being a villain in Miguel’s eyes when he threatens to kill Scarlet Witch.\n\nIn joining the Rangers and later the Avengers, Miguel faces off with many foes including the Black Order, Hydra, Kaine Parker, AKA Scarlet Spider, Morgan le Fay, and Kang to name a few. He goes head to head with Bruce Banner, AKA Hulk, when he is being used by one of the Elders of the Universe, the Challenger.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMEANINGFUL MEMBERSHIPS\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMiguel is at first enemies with the Avengers but allies himself with them after being disillusioned with Doctor Demonicus. He proves to be a reliable ally but sometimes leaves the team to focus on his studies. However,&nbsp;he always comes back when called into the fold. He works closely with Avengers members Wendell Vaughn, AKA Quasar, and Monica Rambeau (formerly Photon now Spectrum), and later becomes a member of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLIVING LIGHTNING'S ADVENTURES\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWith several weeks having passed since he ventured to the Legion’s base, Miguel returned home to inform his mother of recent events, but was saddened to learn that during his absence his brother José had joined the local Jaguars gang and that his sister Lisa had subsequently been killed in a drive-by shooting by the rival Snakes gang; additionally, Miguel’s girlfriend Chung Thị Asuka had become involved with the Snakes leader, Đặng Quang Song, while he had been away. Blaming himself for being absent in his family’s time of need, Miguel intervened in a confrontation between the gangs, hoping to prevent further violence and bring his sister’s killer to justice, but Jaguar leader Carlos Rios shot Song dead moments after the latter boasted he had slain Lisa. However Miguel achieved a partial victory, as his example convinced José to quit the Jaguars, and he warned both gangs that the neighborhood was now under his protection.\n\nReturning to the Avengers, Miguel helped defend Subterranea from the Deviant Brutus’ army; when Subterranean defender Grotesk turned traitor and tried to destroy the world using Brutus’ Oscillatron, Miguel risked his life to absorb its energies into himself. Miguel continued to prove an asset to his new team, aiding them when they were dragged into the extradimensional war between Arkon and Thundra, then helping them battle Jason Roland, AKA Hangman’s Night Shift, personally preventing their master Satannish from taking the millions of viewers’ souls during a televised fight by disrupting the live transmission.\n\nShortly after Hank Pym refined Miguel’s stabilizing units and costume, Earth became a battlefront in the Kree-Shi’ar War, and the Living Lightning joined the Avengers assigned by Steve Rogers, AKA Captain America, as diplomatic envoys to the Shi’ar Imperium, where he unmasked a Skrull agent provocateur posing as Shi’ar Lord Chamberlain Araki, revealing the Skrulls’ part in inciting the conflict. Back on Earth, Miguel assisted in the capture of Deathweb after Ferrell Thompson, AKA Manipulator, sent them to assassinate Liberal Party Presidential candidate Michael Galvan.\n\nWhile attending LA’s public celebration of the Mexican holiday Cinco de Mayo as a headline guest, Miguel was approached by Dr. Lou Denham, a surviving member of the Legion of Living Lightning, who had known Carlos Santos and had deduced the source of Miguel’s powers. He tried to recruit Miguel to help rebuild the Legion, intending to duplicate Miguel’s powers among the Legion’s new members, but Miguel refused, insisting he wanted to work within the system to improve America. Denham briefly took Maria Santos hostage to force Miguel’s cooperation, but Miguel swiftly freed her and overpowered Denham and his men; however a young bystander was winged by a gunshot that had ricocheted off Miguel’s electrical field, and a remorseful Miguel vowed to use his abilities more intelligently in future.\n\nShortly afterwards Miguel joined many of Earth’s heroes battling the Magus’ evil doppelgängers, then assisted the Avengers in defending Stark Enterprises from Professor Power’s armored minions. Reassessing his priorities, Miguel took a leave of absence from the Avengers to pursue college courses at USC, though he returned to attend Tony Stark, AKA Iron Man’s funeral and help the Avengers confront their increasingly irrational member Wonder Man; these events and guilt over his absence when his teammates had been attacked by Ultron-14 made him briefly consider quitting college to return to full-time Avengers status, but the Scarlet Witch convinced him to persist with his education.\n\nWhen the Goddess launched her crusade to purify the universe by destroying it, Miguel was one of those who temporarily fell under her mental domination. Later, during a break from college, Miguel was amongst several Avengers briefly controlled and demonically transformed by Lore to attack the Scarlet Witch.\n\nAfter the Avengers West Coast branch’s dissolution, Miguel transferred to UCLA and concentrated full time on his college studies, until he returned to action alongside virtually all past Avengers to battle Morgan le Fay; when she magically restructured reality to make herself Earth’s ruler, Miguel became Sir Fulminator of Queen’s Vengeance, Morgan’s soldiers in the new Reality-398, but was returned to normal when she was defeated.\n\nLater, when the Avengers set up a deep space monitoring station in the asteroid belt to forewarn them of threats approaching Earth, Miguel, able to easily travel between the station and Earth, agreed to man it alongside Quasar and Monica Rambeau hoping to use the solitude to concentrate on his studies. He subsequently assisted the Avengers against the Triple Evil and Kang’s invasion of Earth, joined an assemblage of Earth’s heroes battling the Order and Akhenaten, and when his old friend the Scarlet Witch went insane and turned her reality-warping powers against the Avengers, Miguel joined most former Avengers in returning to assist the team, shortly before the team was disbanded. Though the Avengers were gone, Miguel continued his monitoring duties aboard the space station.\n\nAt some point having come to accept he was gay, Miguel decided to join the Gay and Lesbian Alliance, leading to a brief misunderstanding when the hero Flatman offered him membership in the Great Lakes Avengers (GLA). After the Superhuman Registration Act (SHRA) was passed, Miguel joined Captain America’s Secret Avengers in opposing it, but after Captain America’s surrender Miguel registered and was assigned to the Texas Initiative team, the Rangers, alongside whom he subsequently battled the criminal agency Hydra, the Skrulls and Scarlet Spider.\n\nThough he later left the Rangers to go solo, and changed his name to Lightning to avoid confusion with Living Laser. He then rejoined the Avengers’ ranks when a contest formed between Elders of the Universe, the Grandmaster and the Challenger, caused a global crisis where many humans on Earth were frozen in stasis. Miguel, one of the only superhumans who was not frozen, alongside some other Avengers investigated one of the Elders’ teams, the Black Order, and subsequently Lightning tried to stop other Avengers elsewhere from interacting with a deadly artifact, the Pyramoid, but did not make it in time and Johnny Storm, AKA Human Torch, seemingly perished.&nbsp;\n\nMiguel worked with the Avengers to stop the Black Order from claiming one of the other Pyramoids. He then sought transportation for the rest of the Avengers’ team but his ally Voyager who had been working for the Grandmaster in secret as she was his daughter, locked herself in the base’s vault with one of the Pryamoids. At this time, Miguel had to face off the Hulk who was working on behalf of the Challenger. The contest ended when the Challenger ostensibly won and sabotaged the World-Engine that had been keeping the Earth stable. Voyager rebelled against her father and teleported heroes including Miguel to the World-Engine where he used his abilities to sustain it with energy. Though the Grandmaster recovered and intent on destroying Earth, Miguel convinced him to a game of poker. Miguel played successfully and rose the stakes so high that Grandmaster folded which allowed the Earth to survive.",

      "biography": "Born over 3000 years ago in Northern Africa, N'Kantu was the son of the chieftain of the now extinct Swarili tribe. N'Kantu grew into a strong, wise young man, proving himself a worthy successor to his father shortly after turning twenty-one. Not long after, Egyptians abducted the entire Swarili tribe despite N'Kantu's valiant efforts. In Egypt the Swarili were enslaved, serving Pharaoh Aram-Set and his corrupt priest, Nephrus. After completing a monument to Aram-Set, N'Kantu led his people to slay the Pharaoh. Nephrus, however, ambushed the chieftain, paralyzing him with a special liquid. N'Kantu was then mummified alive and entombed for millennia. In recent times, N'Kantu finally burst forth from his prison. Half-mad from the lengthy immobility, he rampaged in Cairo, tracing the energies of Dr. Alexi Skarab, a descendant of Nephrus. Finally brought down after a massive battle with local police, N'Kantu was rendered immobile and shipped to a New York museum. He soon awoke and attracted the attention of the Elementals (Zephyr, Hellfire, Hydron and Magnum), who used him as a pawn in their attempts to control the Ruby Scarab. During this period, he became an ally of Skarab, a thief known as the Asp (Richard Harper), the Asp's partner Miles Olddan, and two of Skarab's students, Ron McAllister and Janice Carr. The group eventually defeated the Elementals and parted ways. N'Kantu became a wanderer, befriending Ulysses Bloodstone and observing the Grandmaster's Contest of Champions. He also helped the Thing rescue Alicia Masters from Gamal Hassan, another descendant of Nephrus, who sought the Spirit Gem of Nephrus. Later, N'Kantu sought to use a fragment of the Bloodgem to restore his humanity. He eventually gave the fragment to Captain America during the hero's quest to prevent the shards from falling into the hands of criminals. Once more adrift, N'Kantu briefly found acceptance as part of Doctor Druid's Shock Troop, a group of mystic-oriented heroes, battling the Antibodies alongside Quasar. Since then, he has aided Elsa Bloodstone and the Frankenstein's Monster against the necromancer Rakses. Of late, he has served as guardian to a mystical artifact known as the Orb of Ra. He also briefly recruited against his will to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s team made of mythical and monstrous individuals called Howling Commandos until he rebelled against them.He was captured by S.H.I.E.L.D. as unregistered superhero and was then sent to the Negative Zone Prison Alpha. He was held in special cell that had fire always burning around him, as it was his known weakness. His jail time was short lived as the Captain America's anti-registration forces invaded the prison to free its inmates. N'Kantu was among the inmates who decided to fight against Iron Man's forces. When the battle was winding down N'Kantu slipped away and traveled back to Egypt. He also retrieved the Orb of Ra that he used to call Nephrus from the afterlife to get himself turned back to human. This didn't go unnoticed by Anubis who arrived shortly after Nephrus with his familiar Khet and some others. Khet ordered N'Kantu to surrender the Orb of Ra and release Nephrus. When N'Kantu refused to do so Khet and the others attacked him. N'Kantu won and asked them to restore him back to life but was told its impossible for Anubis and Nephrus. Realizing he was doomed to live forever as he was now devastated him but Anubis made him an offer. Anubis would let him die if he would serve him and collect souls that other religions and gods had stolen from him. N'Kantu decided to accept the offer but only agreed to kill people who were evil. It will be seen where this deal will take N'Kantu and will he finally get his eternal rest.",

      "biography": "The Living Tribunal was a vastly powerful conceptual being, one who had existed since the multiverse came into exsistene. The Living Tribunal's only superior was the One-Above-All (not to be confused with the Celestial that was known as the One Above All), an entity which was apparently responsible for all life in the multiverse, and possibly beyond, (this includes the Earth-616 Universe, Earth X, the Ultimate Universe, and all other alternate and potential realities).NOTE: A universe is a single-dimension reality, such as Earth-616. The Multiverse is the collection of alternate dimensions with a similar nature and universal hierarchy. Earth-616 and alternate Earths seen in the MU (which include beings like the Watcher, Eternity, etc.) are within the same Multiverse. Realms lacking this hierarchy of power are outside of the Multiverse, but within the larger Omniverse. Further, the realms with a Multiverse are divided into divergent earths, who share a common history and diverge at a specific point, and alternate Earths, who are similar, but possess many inherent differences. The Ominiverse is the collection of every single universe, dimension, etc. Everything is in the Ominiverse, and there is only one Ominiverse. Within the Ominiverse, collections of associated realms from different Multiverses are referred to as Megaverses.The Living Tribunal often interacted with other conceptual beings, serving as their arbiter and judge. The Living Tribunal appeared as a giant golden humanoid (using a M-Body, created in the Dimension of Manifestations), with three cloaked faces, each representing a different personality. It has a blank space where a fourth face could be exhibited. The Living Tribunal has suggested that the fourth face became the enigmatic Stranger. The three faces made up the Tribunal’s head. They were: Equity, Necessity, and Vengeance. These represented the trinity of aspects of each universe. For example, in the main universe they were represented by Galactus (Equity), Eternity (Necessity), and Death (Vengeance). Even beings such as  Eternity, Infinity, Death and Oblivion were subject to the Living Tribunals authority. Unlike other conceptual beings, the Living Tribunal had no counterpart in other realities; only one Living Tribunal existed in the Multiverse, and it was responsible for all judgments. The Living Tribunal's apparent base of operations was a dimension known as  the Star Chamber, and it was served by lesser creatures called the Magistrati, who assisted in judging matters where the Living Tribunal could not intervene. The living Tribunal also helped fashion the twin cosmic entities the Brothers, each who became the guardian of a different Megaverse, within the larger Omniverse but encompassing more than a single Multiverse.The Living Tribunal was not guided by any personal motivation or desires, but was entirely impartial, acting only in what was determined to be the greater interest of the universe. The Living Tribunal was more than willing to sacrifice millions of lives for the sake of billions more, or even billions for the sake of trillions, and would not deign to address the concerns of any lesser beings without first establishing a plaintiff's importance.When the Earth-616 sorcerer Doctor Strange brought the creature Zom to Earth in order to help drive off the sorceress Umar, the Living Tribunal was forced to intervene and banished Zom from Earth before he could destroy humanity. However, Zom's mere presence on Earth had tainted all life with the creature’s evil, and the Living Tribunal informed Dr. Strange that the Earth would be destroyed for the greater good. After convincing the Living Tribunal that he was a powerful sorcerer, Dr. Strange won the right for a reprieve, gaining time to try and eliminate Zom's contamination. Dr. Strange received the Staff of Polar Power from the creature Nebulos to absorb the evil magic, most of which was contained within Baron Mordo, but once the staff took Mordo's excess power, Nebulos claimed it for himself. The Living Tribunal intervened to face Nebulos, and Dr. Strange helped the Living Tribunal who obliterated the planet Perilous, and  Nebulos was buried in the rubble, he was presumed dead. The Living Tribunal destroyed the staff rather than destroying the Earth, eliminating the threat.  When Dr. Strange next encountered the Living Tribunal, he was informed that due to his works and heroes like him, the balance between good and evil on Earth had been tipped to good's favor, and that the Tribunal would have to release the In-Betweener to balance the two sides in the interest of the cosmic entities Lord Chaos and Master Order. Opposing the In-Betweener Dr. Strange was defeated. However, the spaceknight Rom argued on behalf of his mission to destroy the Dire Wraiths, stating that the Wraiths might have tipped the scales on Earth to evil's benefit. Rom observed that his presence on Earth would act as a balance to the Wraiths' evil, and the Living Tribunal agreed with him, and withdrew the In-Betweener.The Korvac of Earth-82432 accumulated such power that the Living Tribunal sealed that reality to prevent it from affecting others, removing the barrier only after that Korvac had used the Ultimate Nullifier to destroy himself and the entire universe. When Earth--616's omnipotent Beyonder threatened to eradicate Death itself, the living Tribunal joined other cosmic entities in manifesting before the Beyonder to halt him. Although the Beyonder succeeded in destroying Death, he soon realized that the universe needed Death, and his friend Dave sacrificed himself to become the new Death. When the Living Tribunal first encountered the Silver Surfer, it submitted to him the concept that he was Galactus' opposite number, and allowed the Surfer to become one with the universe for a moment. The Surfer was awestruck by the experience. Later when Earth-89112's reality was overrun with demons, the Living Tribunal nearly destroyed it, but that Earth was redeemed by its counterpart of the Phoenix Force, which eradicated all of the demons. The Living Tribunal then had the Phoenix Force depart from Earth.Shortly after the funeral of the Earth-616 reality's cosmic entity Eon, the living Tribunal was petitioned by many of reality's conceptual beings, who were threatened by the Thanos' ascendance to godhood after claiming the six Infinity Gems and conforming them into a weapon capable of universal destruction. The weapon would come to be known as the Infinity Gauntlet. Although Eternity argued that Thanos was seeking to supplant its role in the universe, the Living Tribunal simply observed that it was the nature of all life, and it was allowed to be played out. However, when the gems wounded up in the custody of Adam Warlock, the Living Tribunal ordered that the gems be divided among six caretakers and never be allowed to act in unison, as Warlock was deemed to unstable to retain such power. In doing so, the Living Tribunal demonstrated that his power surpassed that of the gems. Warlock would go onto form the Infinity Watch, to safeguard the gems. When Warlock's evil side, the Magus rendered Eternity comatose, Galactus argued for the Living Tribunal to remove its ban on the gems so that Warlock could use them to defeat the Magus. Although the Magus obtained the gems himself, he was soundly beaten because he lacked the Reality Gem; Infinity and Eternity defeated him, then had the restriction placed on the gems again. Eternity held a private hearing with the Living Tribunal to argue against the Infinity Watch's continued custodianship of the gems, but the Living Tribunal judged against Eternity. However, the Living Tribunal did confide to Eternity that because the Infinity Watch was within him, yet not under his control, he had obtained a gift of unpredictability which he should treasure.When the powerful Star Brand of Earth-148611 (New Universe) was inadvertently brought into the Earth-616 dimension by Quasar (Wendell Vaughn), it was wielded by his girlfriend Kayla Ballantine, then seized by Erishkigal, a Deviant. She attempted to conquer the Nexus of all Realities, and challenged the Living Tribunal. To determine the fate of the multiverse, they chose as champions Quasar and the Silver Surfer. When Quasar realized  he was Erishkigal's champion, he allowed himself to lose, and the Living Tribunal claimed  the Star Brand, returning it to Kayla for safe keeping. After the Stranger took the Star Brand from Kayla and used it to bring Earth-148611 into the 616 dimension, the Living Tribunal placed a barrier around the planet to keep the Star Brand energies from further contaminating the 616 reality. Kayla was left behind on that world because she had wielded the brand.When the formerly heroic mystic Doctor Druid summoned fourth the demon Slorioth in order to prematurely advance the War of the Seven Spheres which the mystical Vishanti were engaged in, the Vishanti summoned the Living Tribunal and it judged against Slorioth, banishing it from the Earth. When Thanos gained vast power again through the Heart of the Infinite, the Living Tribunal joined champions from across realities to challenge him. Thanos destroyed all that existed with his power, but subsequently had a change of heart and restored reality, ridding himself of his power; the re-created universe lacked the terminal flaw which Thanos had sought to cure. Recently, the Magistrati employed Earth-616's She-Hulk to serve in the Star Chamber and assist them in judging cases from throughout the universe. During her time in the Star Chamber, She-Hulk earned the enmity of Zoma the Watcher for forcing his brother Qyre to be stricken silent. She also met the challenge of the Champion of the Universe when he lorded over the population of Skardon with his Power Gem, and ultimately bested him in combat. In the 31st century of Earth-691, the Living Tribunal was nearly usurped by the Protégé, whose abilities to duplicate the powers of others allowed him to manifest the Living Tribunal's own power. Although the Guardians of the Galaxy struggled futilely against Protégé, it was Scathan the Celestial who saved reality by judging against him, and the Living Tribunal absorbed the Protégé into itself to prevent him from endangering reality again.",

      "biography": "The daughter of a restaurant and hotel owner, Liz Allan came from a family of privilege. She and Peter Parker were childhood friends, but once in high school she became part of the \"popular crowd\" (along with boyfriend Flash Thompson and buddies Jason Ionello, Sean \"Tiny\" McKeever, Seymour O'Reilly, and Sally Avril) who were often picking on him. However, when everyone thought that Peter was foolishly impersonating Spider-Man to rescue Betty Brant from Dr. Octopus, Liz recognized Peter's bravery - and actually developed a crush on him. Peter did not reciprocate Liz's interest while his heart belonged to Betty, but Liz's flirting with him irked Flash so greatly that it led the rivals to a boxing match and a prom-night dare on the unprotected edge of a bridge. After graduation, Liz left Flash and the old crowd behind. She became a nurse's aid, privately tending to her stepbrother, Mark Raxton, the Molten Man. Sometime later, Liz returned to Peter's life. The Molten Man was out of control, and she sought Peter for some levelheaded advice. Liz joined Peter's inner circle of friends where she met Harry Osborn, who had returned from psychiatric care after becoming the Green Goblin. Liz and Harry began dating following Harry's heroics at Betty's wedding and the two fell in love. Liz worked at a hospital while Harry prepared to take over his father's company, but she was arrested trying to steal chemicals from her workplace to help the Molten Man deal with his fiery condition. Ashamed, and fearful of damaging her boyfriend's reputation, Liz left Harry. Later, after tackling the Green Goblin (Bart Hamilton) with Spider-Man, Harry returned home to find Liz waiting for him. With Harry's new responsibilities at Osborn Industries, the couple left for the New Jersey suburbs and married, seeking a peaceful life.That peace was short-lived thanks to both Molten Man and Hobgoblin (Roderick Kingsley) threatening the Osborn family. After a difficult labor brought on by the trauma of facing the Hobgoblin, Liz gave birth to a son, Norman Harold Osborn, and asked Peter and Mary Jane to be the godparents. When the Parkers were evicted, Harry and Liz took them in as tenants. Harry began to lose mental stability again and returned to menacing Spider-Man as the Green Goblin. Liz drifted into a state of denial, unable to cope with her husband's madness. Tragically, Harry was poisoned by an experimental Goblin formula, leaving Liz a young widow. Following Harry's death, Liz took over his responsibilities within Osborn Industries. During this time, she endured the kidnapping of her son by robotic Goblinettes left behind by Harry. \"Normie\" was rescued by Spider-Man and the reformed Molten Man. Upon her father-in-law's return from the \"dead,\" Liz lost control of the company. She dated Foggy Nelson for a short time until Mysterio intervened in the relationship. She currently resides in Riverdale, New York, and remains one of Peter Parker's oldest friends. Their relationship was recently strained, however, when she was forced to lure Peter to her home under false pretenses while the Chameleon's Exterminators team awaited their prey.In the aftermath of Spider-Man accepting an offer from Mephisto to save the life of his Aunt May in exchange for removing his marriage to Mary Jane from ever occurring in history, Harry Osborn has also somehow returned to life. He and Liz are divorced; the details of what transpired differently in time are unrevealed.",

      "biography": "Curt Connors was a gifted surgeon who went into a war to help his country. He performed \"meatball\" surgery on wounded GIs, but his arm was injured in a blast and had to be amputated. He eventually became obsessed with uncovering the secrets of reptilian regeneration, and studied reptilian biology extensively. From his home in the Everglades, he finally determined a serum taken from the DNA of a reptile. He had successfully regrown the missing limb of a rabbit, and, despite the warnings of his wife, chose to test it on himself. Connors ingested it, and his arm did indeed grow back. Unfortunately, it had one side effect: Connors was subsequently transformed into a reptilian monster!Spider-Man learned about this and travelled to Florida, helping the doctor by using Connors' notes to invent a serum to cure him. Later, Connors was able to repay Spider-Man by developing a formula to save May Parker's life after Peter Parker gave his aunt his radioactive blood during a transfusion that had put May in mortal peril.For a time, Peter Parker worked as a teaching assistant to Connors. The success of Connors apparent cure from the Lizard personae was short-lived. A repeating pattern occurred: stress or a chemical reaction turned Connors into the Lizard, Spider-Man would fight him, form some kind of temporary cure to revert the transformation, until the next transformation would begin the cycle again.\nOver time, it became apparent that a second personality had formed with the Lizard, one with the nigh-impossible goal shared by many villains of taking over the world. Eventually his resorts to using an army of lizards stopped and he began working alone. When his wife and son separated from him (due to the marital strain transforming into a Lizard may cause), Connors tried unsuccessfully to straighten out his life. In despair, The Lizard took control, though it had a weak mental strength, causing the voodoo from Calypso to affect him for her own purposes. After a series of bloody battles, the Lizard and Calypso were defeated by Spider-Man, causing Connors to gain control of his bestial mind. Although it was very weak, the suppressed Connors persona carried out a plan and cured himself, but only temporarily.For a time, a huge animalistic Lizard appeared, showing up in many issues, causing everyone to believe the Lizard persona was now permanent. However, when this second Lizard went after Connors, Curt drank the old serum to become the true Lizard once again, and save his son's life. The original Lizard returned and killed the second beast, though it also brought the Lizard persona back into action. Later, it was discovered that this new Lizard was an accident from Connors' latest attempt to cure himself. A new formula was tested on a piece of the Lizard's tail, which grew into a fully-formed second creature. Curt and his wife reunited.One of the Lizard's latest scheme to take over the world had him affecting the water supply to turn everyone into his mindless slaves, though after Connors' son, Billy, almost became one of these zombies, Spider-Man lashed out and attacked the Lizard. After Martha got her share of words in, the Lizard became Connors once again, now begging for help for a cure.Though reunited with his family, and his missing arm restored by Hammerhead, tragedy struck again in the Connors family - this time, for Martha and Billy. Both mother and son were diagnosed with cancer after years exposed to carcinogens from living near an industrial lab of the Monnano Corporation in Florida. Adding to the tragedy, Curt's new arm degenerated and became useless. Spider-Man assisted Curt, and successfully forced the Monnano Corp. to admit their environmental culpability. However, Martha succumbed to the cancer. Billy survived, and remains bitter towards his father.With Billy under Curt's sister's care, a darker, mentally-unstable Connors recently revealed a horrible truth to Spider-Man. Curt had returned to New York in search of a research grant. But when the grant was awarded to another scientist named Eric Richardson, Connors blew up the laboratory, and left his rival badly injured. The Lizard was seen leaving the lab, but Connors convinced Spider-Man of his innocence. However, Curt allowed Spider-Man to lock him inside an abandoned vault in the sewers for everyone's safety. Meanwhile, the Daily Bugle obtained a videotape of the transformation, and publicly exposed the truth that the Lizard is the result of a transformation. Spider-Man went to discuss the latest news with Connors in the vault, but the Lizard persona broke free again. Now, Spider-Man learned the truth - Connors admitted he had been lying - he had been in control of the Lizard for some time, and was using his transformation as an escape mechanism to do horrible things. The Lizard escaped, battering Spider-Man into unconsciousness. After confronting Billy, the Lizard was shaken-up with internal conflict. As Connors, he allowed himself to be easily arrested for a bank robbery and locked up to protect those he loves.The Green Goblin (Norman Osborn) recently freed the Lizard from prison, enhanced his powers to include violence-producing pheromone secretion, and brokered a deal for the creature to join the very short lived Sinister Twelve. The Twelve failed in an attack against Spider-Man and the Black Cat, after the two broke Osborn out of prison. They were defeated by the assistance of the Fantastic Four and other super-powered allies of Spidey.\nMost recently, the Lizard has resurfaced to face Spidey with the aid of a pint-sized \"twin\" of himself--who was revealed to be none other than his son, Billy, finally transformed by his father into the new Lizard. Tragically, however, Billy Connors was shot by a resident of the apartment complex upon which Spider-Man and the Black Cat were fighting them. His condition remains grave, and Curtis himself has escaped to the relative safety of the sewers.",

      "biography": "Curtis Conners is noted geneticist who lost his right arm under unrevealed circumstances, he dedicated himself to finding a means of restoring lost limbs, studying the regenerative capabilities of reptiles; however, after five years without major breakthroughs, his sponsors were on the verge of cutting his funding. Drowning his disappointment with alcohol, the drunken Conners injected himself with an experimental serum in a desperate attempt to achieve results. The serum regenerated his right arm but also transformed Connors into an inhuman reptilian creature. Seeking refuge in the sewers, he became an urban legend, dubbed “The Lizard” by the press. A sympathetic Spider-Man sought out Conners who attacked the young hero until the Man-Thing happened upon the scene and restored Conners to human form. Conners’ restored right arm soon withered and died; however, his DNA remained irreparably damaged, with dormant potential for further transformation, and he cut himself off from his wife and son out of fear for their safety.Conners turned to research on the experimental biological “Suit” designed by Richard Parker, but his work was undercut when Spider-Man, secretly Richard’s son Peter, tested the Suit’s capabilities, and one of Conners’s students, Eddie Brock, absconded with a second sample, then battled Spider-Man while wearing it. When Spider-Man returned to the lab. Conners, who had watched reports of the young hero’s activities and deduced his identity, was waiting him. Although Conners only vaguely recalled their earlier meeting, he felt that he owed the youth a debt and offered to assist him in any way possible.Weeks later, haunted by dreams of his reptilian persona, regretting his impulsive separation from his family, and once more facing funding cuts, Conners sought solace in late-night lab work, only to be interrupted by the arrival of Spider-man, newly injured by the Gladiator. After treating his friend’s wounds, Conners studied a sample of Peter’s blood and was galvanized by its genetic potential. With Peter’s permission, Conners subjected the sample to several experiments over the next two months, earning additional research money and ultimately creating “Little Ben”, a rejuvenating organism created by splicing the altered DNA of both Connors and Spider-Man with the final sample of Richard Parker’s work; however, the creature escaped the laboratory and killed several people. After Spider-Man seemingly destroyed it, Conners, devastated at having once more wreaked havoc via reckless experimentation, confessed his involvement in the deaths and surrendered himself to the police. How his life will next touch Spider-man’s remains to be seen.",

      "biography": "Norton G. Fester was an unappreciated scientist. His theory of microscopic life forms in meteorites was not conducive to receiving funding. He flunked science at high school, and many thought that he was a crack-pot.One day during a field trip, he discovered a freshly-fallen meteorite, but without funding he was forced to perform his own crude investigations. Upon opening the meteor, gas escaped and began to choke him. He later learned that the meteor had given him superhuman powers.His focus immediately turned to crime. He started with grand theft, stealing from banks and other institutions. As his powers started to lose their potency he realized that he had to steal another meteor in order to regain his superhuman powers.He then barged into a local museum only to be confronted by Spider-Man. During the fight Norton managed to escape, but during their second encounter the Looter was defeated by Spider-Man and was taken into custody by the police.\nWhen Ben Reilly , who was acting as Spider-Man at the time, was investigating a robbery a mysterious figure in stilts snatched him away. Later it was revealed that Norton has stolen weapons used by various criminals in order to fund his research. He even stated that S.H.I.E.L.D. agents were after his work because of its importance. After Spider-Man beat Norton again S.H.I.E.L.D. agents arrived and took Norton away on board their helicarrier. The Looter's current whereabouts are unknown.",

He’s a simple guy with a simple goal: protect the innocent by keeping the streets of New York free of crime. And his bulletproof skin makes easy work of that.\n\nHarlem Kid\n\nBorn and raised in Harlem as Carl Lucas, Cage wasn’t always the hero that he would become later in life. As a young member of a street gang, he was surrounded by violence and dreamed of becoming a top racketeer in the city. Despite his misdeeds and connections to crime, Carl maintained a polite disposition—especially in the presence of his beloved grandmother. Instead of expressing his shock or anger with language strictly forbidden by his grandma, he took to phrases like “Sweet Christmas!” which would eventually become his trademark slogan.\n\nAfter realizing that his criminal activities were hurting his family, Carl sought legitimate employment. He left the underworld, but kept in touch with his friend and fellow gang member, Willis Stryker. When Stryker was nearly killed in a botched mob hit, his girlfriend, Reva Connors, broke up with him and pursued a relationship with the seemingly more stable Carl.\n\nJealous, humiliated, and seeking revenge, Stryker planted drugs in Carl’s apartment, which were then found by authorities who arrested Carl for the crime. Sentenced to 20 years in Seagate Prison (A.K.A. “Little Alcatraz”), Lucas initially took to the tough culture of the jail, but soon began to direct his focus on studying legal books in the hopes of clearing his name.",

      "biography": "An experiment of the clandestine organization They (a.k.a. the Third Person or the unseen face that controlled mankind), the woman known only as the Lynx was born without an immune system and raised in a germ-free environment without human contact. As a result, They’s chief scientist, German geneticist Doctor Reigert Ilves, believed the girl to be a perfect subject for his experiments with the drug Panacea, capable of curing all known diseases, and he injected her with the only existing sample. Guilt-stricken over this, Ilves sought to destroy his work by setting his laboratory on fire. The mutant hero Wolverine arrived on the scene, investigating rumors of Ilves’ experiment, but was too late to save Ilves. The Lynx escaped, but Wolverine soon tracked her down and, after a brief scuffle, they were both incapacitated by Courier (Hans Mittlesteadt), a mutant operative of the German government, who were seeking to reclaim the Panacea. While a recovered Wolverine battled Courier, the French mercenary Le Peregrine abducted the Lynx for his employer, corrupt billionaire Imus Champion, who sought the Panacea to cure a rare disease that was killing him.Le Peregrine delivered the Lynx to Champion’s Southern California base, whereupon Champion sent the monstrous Fleshtones to kill Le Peregrine in order to keep the Lynx’s location a secret. Le Peregrine defeated them with the aid of Wolverine &amp; Courier (who had tracked him to Champion’s base) and the Black Widow (Natasha Romanova), an official representative of S.H.I.E.L.D. tasked with bringing in the Lynx. The quartet eventually agreed to work together to free the Lynx, after which the Black Widow convinced the others to take the Lynx into S.H.I.E.L.D.’s protective custody. Wolverine and Courier suspected that S.H.I.E.L.D. might experiment on the Lynx, though, so they liberated her. Wolverine took her to a S.H.I.E.L.D. safehouse, where he soon realized that S.H.I.E.L.D. had injected the Lynx with a persona-inducing serum once used by the Black Widow, hoping that a personality would help her articulate her memories. Ultimately, he allowed the Lynx to revert to her feral state, and she accompanied Wolverine and the Black Widow to the Antarctic base of They, where they discovered the Malaigent, the world’s deadliest disease, which also acted as an “antidote” for the total immunity of the Panacea. After Champion and his forces attacked They’s base, the Lynx and her newfound allies were rejoined by Courier and Le Peregrine in defeating the forces of They and Champion. The Lynx then consumed the Malaigent, which seemingly neutralized the Panacea in her system.Wolverine released the Lynx in a remote part of the Canadian wilderness and departed, hoping that she would live out her life in peaceful solitude, though the smitten Lynx mistakenly believed Wolverine would return to live with her as her mate.",

      "biography": "The eldest child of a wealthy ambassador, mutant Monet St. Croix was a spoiled, pompous girl. After her brother Marius, a student of dark magic, invited her to join him in world conquest, she scornfully rejected him. For this, Marius magically trapped her in the form of a red-skinned mute dubbed Penance. Believing their brother had killed Monet, her young twin sisters banished Marius to another dimension. Seeing Marius as the only way to return to normal, Monet followed. To spare their father from a broken heart at the loss of his favored daughter, the twins used their powers to merge with each other into a single being that duplicated Monet mentally and physically. As Monet, the twins were among those mutants captured by the techno-organic alien Phalanx race, who sought to assimilate mutants into their collective. The twins and their fellow prisoners were rescued by an ad-hoc X-Men team led by Banshee, and they went on to join Generation X, a team of trainee mutants at the Massachusetts Academy under co-headmasters Banshee and Emma Frost. Meanwhile, after years of imprisonment during which Marius – now calling himself Emplate – used her as a source of sustenance for his energy-draining powers, Monet escaped to Earth. She was found by the Australian aboriginal mutant Gateway, who had been mentoring the twins, and he took her to the Massachusetts Academy. Initially distrustful, Monet soon accepted her new situation and ultimately joined the team.Eventually, the twins’ true nature was revealed, and they soon after merged briefly with their brother, learning Monet’s true fate. They next merged with the Penance form, freeing Monet but becoming trapped in it themselves. During a subsequent battle, Jubilee defeated Emplate with an explosion that also freed the twins from the Penance form. Shortly thereafter, Monet’s father withdrew her from the Academy and took the sisters home. Monet was enrolled in a private boarding school in the Swiss Alps, where she soon discovered the headmaster was secretly a vampire feeding on students. Defeating him, Monet returned to the Massachusetts Academy and romanced her teammate Everett Thomas (Synch), who was ultimately killed by a bomb planted by Emma’s sister, Adrienne. The students soon quit, and the Academy closed. Monet and her former teammates Husk and Jubilee joined Banshee’s paramilitary X-Corps. Monet stayed on after the X-Corps was restructured into the X-Corporation, and also aided the X-Men’s Juggernaut against Black Tom Cassidy. Following the X-Corporation’s closure, Monet joined the staff of the mutant detective agency X-Factor Investigations.",

      "biography": "Average technician George Tarleton found his fate forever changed thanks to a random selection by his boss, the Scientist Supreme of A.I.M., who needed a unique, bio-engineered “living computer” in order to plumb the mysteries of the Cosmic Cube. Tarleton was subjected to hideous experiments, mutating his body into a massive-headed being possessing superhuman intelligence and extraordinary psionic powers, and the process drove him mad. Given the code-name M.O.D.O.C. (\"Mobile Organism Designed Only for Computing\"), Tarleton instead turned on his superiors, slaying them all and declaring himself Scientist Supreme. Moreover, he changed his name to M.O.D.O.K., with the “K” standing now for “Killing.”\n\nKnowing only the barest of information, S.H.I.E.L.D. sent its Agent 13 to gather intelligence about A.I.M. and M.O.D.O.K., but she was captured and Captain America was then sent to the rescue. The two heroes were captured, but ultimately discovered M.O.D.O.K. when he revealed himself and tried to kill them personally. During the resultant clash, other A.I.M. agents, those opposed to M.O.D.O.K.'s leadership, turned on him and allowed Captain America and Agent 13 to escape. The submarine base destroyed, M.O.D.O.K. was believed dead, although he used his psionic abilities to save himself and soon reasserted his leadership over A.I.M.\n\nInitially, M.O.D.O.K. turned A.I.M.’s pursuits toward acquiring technology and new recruits, running into conflict with Captain America, Doctor Doom and the Sub-Mariner, and the Hulk. During the latter confrontation, M.O.D.O.K. first used a giant robot body in a preemptive strike on the Hulk, and later he mutated Betty Ross into the Harpy to defeat him (although M.O.D.O.K. was stopped by the arrival of the Bird People.) M.O.D.O.K. used his giant body to confront Iron Man, capturing him but being defeated by the Yellow Claw.\n\nFollowing this defeat, M.O.D.O.K. was deposed as leader of A.I.M., as his followers were dissatisfied with M.O.D.O.K.'s increasing preoccupation with his super-powered adversaries causing A.I.M. to largely abandon its goals for scientific breakthroughs. However, M.O.D.O.K. regained control of a West Coast faction of A.I.M. and, in alliance with Deathbird, he led A.I.M. in an attack on its East Coast division. Still, a considerable portion of the A.I.M. organization remained outside of M.O.D.O.K.'s control. M.O.D.O.K. did not realize that the members of A.I.M. whom he believed were securely under his control were secretly conspiring with the other faction of A.I.M. to destroy him. To his surprise, both A.I.M. groups joined forces and attacked him. M.O.D.O.K. retreated, soon afterwards fighting A.I.M. forces alongside the Hulk, but he finally fled after battling the Hulk himself. With M.O.D.O.K. gone, all of A.I.M. was finally reunited under new leadership.\n\nThe new leaders of A.I.M. hired the Serpent Society to assassinate M.O.D.O.K. to prevent him from posing any further threat to them. M.O.D.O.K. had escaped capture, ultimately hiding in a warehouse at a shopping mall in Newbury, New Jersey, but he was followed by both the Serpent Society and Captain America. Captain America found the weakened M.O.D.O.K. as two of the Serpents, Cottonmouth and Death Adder, were tearing away at his flesh. M.O.D.O.K. died even as Captain America was trying to help him, and the Serpents delivered his corpse back to A.I.M.\n\nA.I.M. managed to keep M.O.D.O.K.'s body for use as a living computer, similar to his intended origin, but A.I.M. agent Yorgon Tykkio sent M.O.D.O.K. into battle against Iron Man, guiding him by remote control. At the height of battle, however, Tykkio caused M.O.D.O.K.'s headband to fire plasma that ignited underground fuel lines, causing an explosion that ultimately annihilated M.O.D.O.K.'s body.\n\nYears later, A.I.M. once again sought the control of the Cosmic Cube, and in so doing they tore reality itself. Using the Cube, they restored M.O.D.O.K. to life, hoping that he could command the energies to fix reality. Although it was actually an Adaptoid that saved the day, M.O.D.O.K. took advantage to resume leadership of A.I.M. once more.\n\nHe returned to his preoccupation with his rivals, battling Captain America and Iron Man, but he also explored new avenues for A.I.M., such as exploring the relationship of science and magic (running afoul of Alpha Flight for reviving their member Snowbird), allying with Hydra over nanotechnology (before taken down by Citizen V and the V-Battalion), and creating a legitimate corporate front for A.I.M. as Advanced Corp. (until exposed by Iron Man.) M.O.D.O.K. was once saved by the Headmen from where he had lost himself in an extradimensional quest for additional power. In gratitude, he agreed to join them in their hopes of taking over the world, helping them do so with the help of the alien Orrgo. M.O.D.O.K. admitted, however, that this association was merely scientific, as he examined the efforts of the Headmen to better understand himself, and he and A.I.M. disassociated themselves from the Headmen before the villains were thwarted by the Defenders.\n\nIn a strange series of events, M.O.D.O.K. appeared to be hunting down and killing all A.I.M. agents responsible for his original transformation. In fact, M.O.D.O.K. had switched bodies with Damocles “the Saint” Rivas, the brother of a drug lord who developed a viral bio-weapon using M.O.D.O.K.'s DNA, and Damocles was acting on M.O.D.O.K.'s long-suppressed hatred of his form. M.O.D.O.K. had hoped to use Rivas to claim the scheme for himself, but ran afoul of the Falcon and the Anti-Cap. His defeat sent his mind back into his body, where it co-existed with Damocles. Damocles instead hoped to engage the Hulk in battle and thereby destroy M.O.D.O.K.'s form, but Captain America intervened, inspiring Damocles to use M.O.D.O.K.'s mental powers to revert the Hulk to Bruce Banner and gain his help to cure the M.O.D.O.K. virus. M.O.D.O.K. was rendered comatose, but he soon reverted to normal to once more lead A.I.M., with all traces of Damocles Rivas expunged.",

Using his considerable mechanical knowledge, Jenkins built an armor-plated, strength-augmenting suit, a pair of gravity-defying wings, suction-fingered gloves, and a cybernetic control helmet. Calling himself the Beetle, Jenkins decided to use his battle suit for fame, wealth, and adventure. Believing a victory over half the Fantastic Four would make him an overnight sensation, the Beetle chose to lure the Human Torch and the Thing into battle. Unfortunately, the Thing and the Human Torch defeated him, and he was sent to prison.When Baron Zemo formed the Thunderbolts, Jenkins made a new armor, the Mobile Armored Cyber-Harness, and took on the name of MACH-I. Zemo's plan was to gain the favor of the citizens of New York, which was in need of heroes after the disappearance of the Avengers and Fantastic Four after Onslaught's attack, only to gain access to classified S.H.I.E.L.D. files and eventually control the world. Jenkins and several of his teammates began to like the hero life, and decided to leave their villainous pasts behind. Zemo instead revealed that the Thunderbolts were actually ex-Masters of Evil members to the public, leaving the new heroes with a public unwilling to trust them.The murder he committed eventually came back to haunt Abe. When Hawkeye took over leadership of the team, he convinced Jenkins to serve out his prison sentence as a gesture of good will to the public. While in prison, someone used the Beetle armor to frame Jenkins, so he broke out. Abe was given a new face and appearance by Fixer along with the alias of Matthew Davis.Eventually Jenkins returned his features to normal and returned to prison to finish his sentence. Spending time as a hero seemed to change his outlook on life. After being released from prison, Jenkins reformed the Thunderbolts with the funding of Baron Strucker.

      "biography": "The robot X-51 was created from a top-secret U.S. military project that hoped to make a robot soldier that could think like a man. 51 experimental robots were engineered, but Dr. Abel Stack, computer heuristics programming specialist, knew that the robot could only think like a man if he was treated as one. He stole the 51st robot and began treating him as if he were his own son, calling him Machine Man and even creating an artificial face for him from simulated flesh and hair. Dr. Stack was proven correct: the other 50 robots began experiencing severe personality defects and were deemed too dangerous; the government ordered that the robots’ self-destruct mechanisms be activated. Unfortunately, in the process of removing Machine Man’s self-destruct, Dr. Stack himself was killed when it went off.  Vowing to fulfill Dr. Stack's dream, Machine Man adopted a human identity, Aaron Stack, and tried to find his place in the world of human beings. He eventually met psychiatrist Peter Spaulding and mechanic \"Gears\" Garyin, who would become his friends. He worked for a time as an insurance investigator for the Delmar Insurance Company, although his employer and fellow employees were unaware he was a robot.Machine Man fought to preserve himself in a world that feared the machine, especially against Senator Miles Brickman and the costumed villain Madame Menace. The U.S. government attempted to hunt down Aaron, but eventually pardoned him after he stopped one of the Hulk’s rampages.On a later adventure, he met and fell in love with the robot Jocasta, but she was destroyed in battle with her creator Ultron. Later still, Machine Man was contacted by the robot Super-Adaptoid in joining Heavy Metal, a team of robots in order to fight the heroes known as the Avengers, although he then aided the Avengers in their fight against the Adaptoid.Machine Man later aided the Avengers again, this time against the threat of the alien known as Terminus. At the time, the robot had acquired the head of Jocasta, which had been recovered and lost by agents of the villainous High Evolutionary. In the course of this battle, Machine Man narrowly avoided a confrontation with Madame Menace, who ultimately ended up with the Jocasta head. Machine Man again aided the Avengers West Coast branch, being accepted as one of their member so he could join them in the fight against the villains Doctor Demonicus and the Pacific Overlords. As a provisional member of the Avengers, he joined them on a couple more adventures, and was peripherally involved in the battle between the villain Graviton and the heroes of the Thunderbolts.After several months, Machine Man was then captured by the international espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D. who wanted to use his technology to further the creation of the new Deathlok cyborg. At the same time, the villainous Red Skull captured the techno-organic being Douglock and took over the S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Helicarrier transport. Machine Man assisted the heroes of the X-Men in rescuing Douglock and the SHIELD agents trapped onboard, seemingly at the cost of his own life.However, the evil mutant team called the Brotherhood recovered what was left of Machine Man and captured SHIELD Agent Jack Kubrick who was also searching for the robot. After discovering the remains, Brotherhood members Mimic, Blob, Mystique, Toad, and Post were attacked by the recently resurrected Machine Man. During the battle Post shot and seemingly killed Kubrick, but the agent merged with Machine Man`s head and claimed that he was, in fact, X-51 in a new body. As X-51, he discovered his new body contained microscopic nanotech machines called \"nanites\" that could repair any damage instantly. X-51 also found that his new programming included remnants of mutant-hunting Sentinel programming, and thus felt compelled to attack and destroy any mutants that he came into contact with. He immediately tried to destroy the Brotherhood and then, afterward, Sebastian Shaw of Shaw Industries and the world-dominating Hellfire Club. When he sought the Avengers for help, he attacked their newest members Justice and Firestar before retreating.X-51 recognized his internal systems were somehow affected and he sought help from his friends in the past, Peter Spaulding and his wife, Jill. The two tried to help the robot but X-51 had become targeted by the Sentinels, the same mutant-hunting machines that had corrupted his systems. The fight between X-51 and the Sentinels threatened to destroy the town if not for the timely arrival of the X-Men. Unfortunately, during the fight, the Sentinels' technology overwhelmed X-51, and he turned on the X-Men. The X-Men battled X-51 until he experienced a moment of mental clarity. In his final act of heroism, X-51, unbeknownst to the X-Men, willingly gave up his own life to stop the battle, allowing his robotic body to explode.At the same time, the United States government had deemed X-51 a threat and ordered Jack Kubrick, agent of the Commission on Superhuman Activities, to investigate. Kubrick was presumably assigned the case because X-51 had been using his identity since presumably merging with Kubrick during X-51's encounter with the mutant Brotherhood. It seemed that the Kubrick absorbed by X-51 was in fact an android (a Life Model Decoy.) The real agent Kubrick investigated the circumstances of X-51's death and returned to the Commission with his report.In fact, X-51 did not truly perish. The nanotechnology in his system rebuilt his body, this time free of Sentinel technology, as well as his mind. X-51's memories were lost, except for those of his father, which he purposefully retained. X-51 began wandering the country, but he soon encountered an alien monolith. The monolith somehow transported itself and X-51 away to an unknown destination. X-51 has since reappeared and taken on a more human appearance than ever before, despite the fact that he is more open to criticize the lifestyles of the “fleshy ones” around him. Calling himself simply “Aaron Stack,” he joined the H.A.T.E. organization, under circumstances yet to be revealed, working with other heroes such as Monica Rambeau (Photon) and Tabitha Smith (Meltdown) in Nextwave. When the heroes discovered H.A.T.E. was actually funding the terrorists they hoped to stop, Aaron joined Nextwave in dedicating themselves to stopping H.A.T.E. once and for all.  Note: In a previous account of an alternate 1990, Machine Man was deactivated and buried by his old enemy, industrialist Sunset Bain, alias Madame Menace. In this timeline, Machine Man remained buried until 2020 when he is exhumed and reactivated by a youthful gang of technology scavengers called the Midnight Wreckers.",

      "biography": "As a child, Maguire Beck idolized her older cousin Quentin Beck, a Hollywood special effects expert who became the super-villain Mysterio. When Quentin invited Maguire to join him in his life of crime, she readily accepted, using her computer expertise to help upgrade Quentin's special effects. In return, Quentin taught Maguire the secrets behind his illusions. Quentin also had two other students at the time: Daniel \"Danny\" Berkhart, Quentin's former cellmate who — during a time when Quentin had faked his own death — was hired by Daily Bugle publisher J. Jonah Jameson to pose as the ghost of Mysterio and capture Spider-Man, only to be arrested and then abandoned by Jameson; and Conundrum, an enigmatic student of Eastern mysticism who claimed to know nothing about his own past. Conundrum left to pursue his own ambitions and Berkhart adopted the costumed identity of Jack O'Lantern (previously used by Jason Macendale before becoming the Hobgoblin), a.k.a. Mad Jack, to pursue his personal vendetta against J. Jonah Jameson for abandoning him years ago. Though hired by Norman Osborn to target Jameson, Berkhart ultimately burned the cash to show his personal involvement. Maguire joined forces with Berkhart to hone her craft, usually remaining behind the scenes and using her computer technology to assist Berkhart, communicating with him via a radio transmitter built into a robotic cat. Maguire always thought that she and Quentin would eventually become full partners in crime — but then Quentin unexpectedly committed suicide. Devastated, Maguire dedicated her life to destroying everyone she regarded as having abused, exploited, or humiliated Quentin.Upon learning of Quentin's suicide, Berkhart again became Mysterio and gave his Jack O'Lantern costume to Maguire, who became the new Mad Jack in order to distinguish herself from previous Jack O’Lanterns, preferring to orchestrate her illusions from behind a computer keyboard. As the new Mysterio, Berkhart briefly joined the Sinister Seven and then unsuccessfully attempted to determine Spider-Man's true identity, but later reaffiliated himself with Maguire (although Maguire's increasing mental instability led her to believe that the new Mysterio was actually Quentin). Together, the new Mysterio and Mad Jack plotted revenge against all those who had wronged Quentin. Mad Jack abducted J. Jonah Jameson. They kidnapped Quentin's ex-girlfriend Betsy Schneider, who had made a living selling toys and children's books using Mysterio's likeness, and her husband Joe Smith. Finally, the duo incapacitated Spider-Man and Daredevil (Matthew Murdock) by dousing them in hallucinogenic \"Joy Juice\" which negated their super-powers. Mad Jack and Mysterio placed their prisoners in virtual reality \"Happy Tanks\" where they were to be kept incapacitated forever; however, the heroes escaped and defeated Mad Jack, finally learning her true identity, although not realizing the involvement of Berkhart, who had escaped.",

      "biography": "Sir James Jaspers was a British politician elected on an anti-superhuman platform; secretly a reality-warping mutant himself, his true motive was to eliminate competition. He was also utterly insane. He instigated a superhero purge carried out by the Status Crew and the Fury, an unstoppable, unremitting hero-killing cybiote Jaspers designed, which hunted down and slew every other superhuman. Now unopposed, Sir James became Mad Jim Jaspers, committing robberies for fun, accompanied by the “Alice in Wonderland”-themed Crazy Gang he created. His powers grew, and eventually Jaspers engulfed his entire dimension in a terrifying reality warp. The other-dimensional DDC (Dimensional Development Court) destroyed Jaspers’ entire universe (home to Earth-238) to prevent the madness becoming multiversal.Merlyn had been aware of this threat. Worse, he knew Earth-616’s Jaspers, who was beginning his rise to power, was equally insane and vastly more powerful; even destroying his reality could not end that Jaspers’ threat. During the hero purge on Earth-238, Merlyn allowed his champion on that world, Captain U.K., to escape to Earth-616; he also arranged for Earth-616’s Captain Britain (Brian Braddock) to visit Earth-238 and encounter 238’s Jaspers. Though this forewarned both heroes of Earth-616’s Jaspers, Merlyn’s true purpose was to lure the Fury to Earth-616 pursuing them. The Earth-616 Jaspers became Prime Minister, ordering STRIKE (Special Tactical Reserve for International Key Emergencies) to round up the U.K.’s superhumans. As Jaspers enveloped the world in a reality storm, Captain Britain confronted him, but proved helpless against him; however, the Fury, which had been pursuing the hero, arrived soon after. Reasoning that this Jaspers was not the creator it had been programmed to leave unmolested, the Fury attacked. After a prolonged battle, the Fury transported them to the void where its world once was. Lacking any external reality to manipulate, Jaspers was rendered helpless, and the Fury killed him, frying his brain.Recently, during the Scarlet Witch’s “House of M” reality warp, Jaspers reformed alive, well, and apparently merged with the Fury. It is unclear whether this is Earth-238’s Jaspers or 616’s, or if his revival stems from the Witch’s warp or another cause. Whatever the truth, while Jaspers lives, the entire multiverse is in danger.Note: During the trial of Magneto, some time after Mad Jim’s death, Sir James Jaspers served as prosecutor. The origin of this Jaspers, perhaps an imposter, a non-powered clone created by Roma (Merlyn’s daughter), or even a facsimile created by reality itself trying to heal the damage caused by Jaspers’ warp, is as yet unrevealed.",

      "biography": "The Mad Thinker was originally a criminal named The Thinker who used advanced computers and his intellect to plan out every detail of a crime in order to have the best chance of success. He was virtually unknown until the day he gathered together the crime bosses all around the country and announced that he would take over New York and establish it as a sovereign nation with himself as the ruler. Though the one obstacle to the plan was the Fantastic Four, and so the Thinker designed a plan in which he would cause each of the members of the four to be offered ideal jobs, which would distract them away from the Baxter Building. This ploy worked and the Thinker and his allies took advantage of an expected meteor strike which shut off power to New York City, allowing them to break into the Baxter Building. This gave the Thinker access to all of Reed Richard’s knowledge and experiments. Using Richards' research into DNA, he created his first version of the Awesome Android. The Fantastic Four eventually returned to find the Thinker had taken over the Baxter Building, and they defeated him with the help of their mailman, Willy Lumpkin, who was instructed to push the doorbell at 4 o’clock, thereby shutting down all of Reed’s equipment.The Thinker was imprisoned and dubbed “The Mad Thinker” by the media, which is a notion he detests. Since then, the Mad Thinker has spent a lot of his time in prison, frequently escaping by using his mind to transfer his consciousness into a series of Mad Thinker androids and committing his crimes while still physically in prison. The Mad Thinker was also one of the villains that Doctor Doom coerced into disrupting Reed and Sue's wedding, though Iron Man appeared and stopped him. He has continued to construct new, more advanced androids, and later found and resurrected the original android Human Torch in order to fight the Fantastic Four. Though the original Torch soon turned on him, refusing to be a party to murder, and he destroyed it with his sentient computer, Quasimodo. Along with multiple confrontations with the Fantastic Four, the Mad Thinker has also faced many other heroes, including the Avengers, Spider-Man, Captain America, and the X-Men. The Mad Thinker recently teamed up with his sometime-ally, the Puppet Master, in order to take advantage of the chaos caused by the Civil War|Super Hero Registration conflict.",

      "biography": "Though Cassandra Webb suffered from a lifetime of blindness and many years of neurological deterioration due to myasthenia gravis, she compensated with her profound psychic abilities, establishing herself as a medium. Using these powers, Madame Web discovered Peter Parker's secret identity when Spider-Man rescued one of her students who had been kidnapped during a scam at the Daily Globe newspaper. Later, Madame Web helped Spider-Man prevent an assassination attempt against a political candidate. When Black Tom Cassidy sent the Juggernaut to kidnap Web so he could use her powers for his criminal activities, she foresaw the attack and called Spider-Man for help. He was unable to stop the Juggernaut, who left Madame Web in a state of severe shock after he unknowingly removed her from her chair, which provided her vital life functions.After being in a coma and suffering short-term memory loss, she appeared to temporarily forget Spider-Man's identity. She again contacted him for help since, through her power of precognition, she had witnessed her own impending death. Believing that joining Norman Osborn in an arcane ritual called the Gathering of the Five would save her life, she asked Spider-Man to retrieve one of the five required artifact fragments. Each of the five participants would receive either knowledge, power, immortality, insanity, or death. Spider-Man succeeded, and in the course of the ceremony, Madame Web apparently received death. Actually, she received immortality, and found herself much younger and healthier.Soon after, Doctor Octopus created a Spider-Woman using Cassandra's granddaughter, Charlotte Witter, whose siphoning powers absorbed the abilities of each of the other female web-slingers (Jessica Drew, Julia Carpenter, and Martha \"Mattie\" Franklin). To capture Charlotte, Madame Web gathered the spider women into a team. Charlotte was defeated, but later siphoned Madame Web's telepathy, re-aging her in the process. With the help of Spider-Man and Franklin, Madame Web determined how to drain Charlotte's power, leaving Witter unconscious in a dormant state. Madame Web, now youthful again, performed psychic surgery to sever her link to Charlotte and removed Charlotte and Mattie's memories of Spider-Man's identity. Madame Web continued to assist Mattie during the rest of her time as Spider-Woman. The Spider-Women team eventually disbanded. Madame Web has since appeared elderly again, however she presumably has retained her immortality.",

      "image": "https://terrigen-cdn-dev.marvel.com/content/prod/1x/maelstrom.jpg",
      "biography": "Maelstrom is the son of Phaedar, a member of the sub-species race of humanity known as the Inhumans. Phaedar was a geneticist in Attilan, but his cloning experiments met with disapproval from the Genetics Council; he lost a bid for leadership of the council to Agon, and was subsequently banished from the council for his experiments. To obtain freedom, Phaedar created a clone of himself and killed it so he would not be missed, then ventured into the outside world to perform his experiments. Phaedar eventually mated with a woman named Morga, of the Deviants, a genetically unstable sub-species. They raised Maelstrom in Deviant Lemuria in his early years, but Morga was put to death for having relations with an outsider, and Maelstrom was made a slave. Phaedar eventually rescued Maelstrom, but he was now as much against the Deviants as his father was against the Inhumans.   Maelstrom and Phaedar’s superior knowledge of genetics revolutionized humanity’s scientific community from the early 1900’s on, and they shared their knowledge with humans including Herbert Wyndham (the High Evolutionary), to whom they provided some of the Deviants’ subterranean slaves to aid him in constructing the Citadel of Science on Mount Wundagore. They also aided his assistant Miles Warren (the Jackal), and Wladyslav Shinski of the Enclave. Notes of theirs wound up in the possession of the mad bio-engineer Arnim Zola, and one of their laboratories was found by the mutant Magneto, who used their equipment to create the superhuman Alpha the Ultimate Mutant. Maelstrom and Phaedar recruited the minions Gronk, Helio and Phobius from among the ranks of the Deviants and Inhumans, and were also aided by Deathurge, who was actually serving the cosmic entity Oblivion. Over time, Phaedar and Maelstrom would transfer their minds into cloned bodies to perpetuate their existence, but Phaedar eventually became too weak to continue the process. Experiments that Phaedar and Maelstrom performed granted Maelstrom the ability to harness kinetic energy. At some point, Maelstrom mated with a Deviant named Medula, and she secretly bore him a son, the almost human-looking Ransak the Reject, now taken into slavery just as his father had been. One of Maelstrom and Phaedar’s associates, Dr. Hydro, had been provided with a sample of the Terrigen Mist which grants Inhumans their powers, and he used it to transform people into amphibians (“Hydro-Men”). When the Inhumans sought to cure the Hydro-Men, they were surprised to find that their Terrigan Mist was involved, and with the aid of Mr. Fantastic, created an Anti-Terrigan Mist Compound, which would undo its effects. When Maelstrom learned of the compound’ invention, he sent his minions to obtain a sample. Although the minions obtained the sample, they could not avoid capture; Maelstrom had Deathurge kill them to prevent their immanent interrogation, and then resurrected them in new clone bodies. Regardless, his actions put the Thing and the Inhumans on his trail, and they invaded Maelstrom’s lab. Phaedar died in his sleep while Maelstrom was battling Black Bolt, the son of Agon, and Maelstrom had Deathurge kill his current body so that he could escape the conflict in an new one. He destroyed his laboratory so that the Inhumans could not study it. In a new body, Maelstrom stole into Olympia, city of the Eternals, as the Eternals were gathering their population to join their forms together into the Uni-Mind. Maelstrom created a device to siphon the Uni-Mind’s kinetic energies into himself, but the Avengers defended the Eternals, releasing them from the Uni-Mind. When Starfox attempted to use his powers to make Maelstrom surrender, Maelstrom had himself slain by Deathurge again. In his next scheme, Maelstrom used knowledge gleaned from the Uni-Mind to construct a device which would siphon the entire Earth’s kinetic energy into himself, gradually slowing its rotation and tearing the planet apart. Opposing him, the Avengers forced him to absorb more energy than he could contain, spreading his molecules across the universe. As Maelstrom began to draw his body back together again, he encountered the cosmic being Kronos and learned of the abstract powers that governed the universe from him. Maelstrom sought out the entity Anomaly and slew it, assuming its role in the cosmic universe, and made a formal alliance with Oblivion, offering up the universe to his patron. To set his plans in motion, Maelstrom sought the power of cosmic awareness, which was guarded by the entity Eon. Eon foresaw his approaching death, and charged his protector of the universe Quasar (Wendell Vaughn) to prevent it; however, another servant of Oblivion called the Unbeing temporarily unmade Quasar’s heroic identity, allowing Maelstrom an opportunity to arrive on Earth undetected, although Quasar regained his identity from Unbeing’s counterpart Origin. Maelstrom tricked Quasar into thinking that the threat he had prepared for was the Russian villain the Presence so that he would lower his guard. He also weakened Quasar’s relationship with Eon by killing Quasar’s father Gilbert Vaughn. Eon kept Gilbert’s death a secret from Quasar, although, when it finally came out, Quasar felt betrayed and refused to continue serving Eon. Needing Quasar’s quantum bands to enter Eon’s realm, Maelstrom, flanked by his lovers the Weird Sisters and his minions, assumed the identity of Malcolm Stromberg. Posing as a client for the security firm Quasar ran in his secret identity, Maelstrom tricked Quasar into entering his home with his friends, then threatened their lives to force him to surrender. Since Malestrom was unable to remove the Quantum Bands from Quasar’s wrist while he was alive, Maelstrom sliced his hands off, and used the Bands to find Eon. When Quasar finally died, Maelstrom took the Quantum Bands for himself. Trying to prevent Maelstrom from taking cosmic awareness from Eon, Quasar’s spirit destroyed Eon’s brain, but Maelstrom had already achieved his goal. With his newfound powers, Maelstrom slowed the Earth’s rotation, and then set out to destroy the universe by halting all movement, generating a massive black hole. Maelstrom confronted many of the universe’s great powers to revel in his superiority over them, including Thanos, then-wielder of the six Infinity Gems. Quasar continued to oppose Maelstrom. Their battle carried them over a black hole, whose forces crushed Maelstrom. The cosmic entity Infinity chose Quasar as her champion against Oblivion, and Oblivion summoned forth Maelstrom’s spirit to battle Quasar to determine the fate of the universe. Quasar bested Maelstrom when he demonstrated that, due to an alteration Origin had made to him when she recreated him earlier, he himself had become an anomaly, and therefore challenged Maelstrom’s role as Anomaly. Maelstrom died, and the black hole ceased to exist. Maelstrom’s minions and the Weird Sisters attempted to revive him using captured Deviants whose kinetic energy he could drain. The Eternals and the Fantastic Four joined together to halt Maelstrom’s resurrection, but when he learned that one of the Deviants was Ransak the Reject, his own son, he refused to take his life, and shrank into the Microverse. Maelstrom was converted into proto-natural force as he descended, and claimed to behold the grand design of the universe. He became determined to learn the secret of the universe by destroying it. To do so, he stole a chronal accelerator from the Roxxon Oil Corporation to speed the universe to its demise. The Great Lakes Avengers opposed him, but he killed their teammate Dinah Soar and escaped. He hired Batroc's Brigade to aid him in gathering the other components he needed, and to serve as bodyguards against super-heroes. When Maelstrom finally activated the chronal accelerator, the Great Lakes Avenger Mr. Immortal confronted him with the suggestion that with all life gone, his own existence would have no meaning, just an eternity of loneliness. Mr. Immortal shot himself in the head as a means of demonstrating a way out of loneliness. Maelstrom followed suit, but was unaware that Mr. Immortal could not die, and the hero shut off the chronal accelerator as soon as he revived. Protesting that he had been tricked, Maelstrom’s spirit was brought to Oblivion by Doorman, Deathurge’s new replacement.",

Japheth sought to return home to save Daniel; the harsh desert proved too much for them, but they were saved by Magneto.Magneto discovered that Japheth was a mutant possessing a sentient digestive system. Magneto returned Japheth and his brother to their village, which was assaulted by Apartheid soldiers. His eldest brother Lot dead and his father under attack, Japheth asked Magneto to rescue his father. Magneto mercilessly slew the soldiers, outraging Japheth who subsequently refused Magneto’s offer to join him.Years later, as Maggott, he sought Magneto to “cure” him.

      "biography": "Illyana Rasputin is a mutant teleporter mage and the occasional demon queen of limbo. As little sister to Colossus, she eventually joins him on Earth-616 alongside the X-Men as a permanent member. She takes the codename Magik and protects others with the New Mutants.\n\n \n\nIllyana Rasputin\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA late addition to the Rasputin family, Russian farm girl Illyana Nikolievna Rasputina was the beloved “little snowflake” of her parents and older brother Piotr (“Peter”), born a year after the apparent death of her eldest brother, the cosmonaut Mikhail Rasputin. Unknown to his family, Mikhail was a mutant, and the Russian government faked his death; grief upon hearing of his demise triggers Peter’s mutant powers too, and when Illyana is five, Professor Charles Xavier, AKA Professor X, recruits Peter into his American-based mutant team, the X-Men.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nImpatient and full of life, Illyana asks her parents if she would get powers too, and when she could join her brother overseas. Her chance came sooner than her family thought, and most unexpectedly. When a Dr. Doom robot imprisoned the criminal Arcade, his assistant Miss Locke kidnaps the 6-year-old Illyana and other innocent hostages, forcing the X-Men to rescue Arcade. Not trusting Locke to keep her end of the bargain, a team of X-Men reservists invade Arcade’s Murderworld and retrieve the hostages. The siblings miss one another, so Peter arranges with his parents for Illyana to stay at Xavier’s School for a little while. The X-Men dote on her, especially Peter’s teenage would-be girlfriend Katherine “Kitty” Pryde.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTeleportation and Sorcery\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMagik can teleport herself and others via circles of light dubbed stepping discs; though this is apparently an innate mutant power, her demonic corruption has seemingly inextricably tied the discs to limbo, so that they also appear there randomly without Magik summoning them, and so that the discs always travel via limbo. Possibly because limbo’s nexus status makes it close to all places and times, Magik can teleport across interstellar distances or transtemporally, and home in on specific people without knowing their exact location.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIllyana is a skilled swordswoman and creates the Soulsword when she is trapped in the immortal sorcerer Belasco's limbo dimension.&nbsp;She draws the sword from her own life force and uses it to destroy supernatural beings and magical weapons. It begins as a simple sword but evolves with use, both in appearance and power. The Soulsword can disrupt most spells or slay magical beings, but which passes through normal people without harming them. When using it, Illyana’s body becomes covered in a mysterious mystic armor.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen she is unable to wield it, the sword is passed to Rasputina’s best friend, Kitty Pryde. She gives it to Amanda Sefton (alias sorceress Jimaine Szardos), who in turn passes it on to her mother, Margali Szardos. Belasco then takes it from her. After a battle with Belasco, Jimaine takes possession of the Soulsword, and hides it inside her adopted brother Nightcrawler’s own body.&nbsp; She uses an axe in battle until she reclaims her Soulsword.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMagik also possesses exceptional psionic shields able to thwart Earth’s most powerful telepaths. Magik becomes the Sorceress Supreme of limbo, using a mixture of white and black magic to cast binding spells and energy blasts, heal, wipe memories, perform scrying, project an astral form, and other talents; however, on Earth, her magic is weaker.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen Magik taps into her magical powers, mystical armor appears to cover her body known as Eldritch armor. The armor protects her from physical and magical attacks, enhances her strength and shields her from the Transmode Virus. After becoming Darkchilde, her demon form, and later when she uses her magic, hooves and horns are known to appear as well.\n&nbsp;\n\nEvil Enemies\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBelasco, limbo’s demon-lord, seeks Magik as a replacement. He lures her to his dimension and taints her soul with evil then trains her in sorcery. Belasco has his lackey S’ym torture her when she misbehaves but the student surpasses the master and she eventually escapes his terror, restores her humanity, and makes S’ym swear fealty to her.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe Beyonder senses the evil in Magik and draws it out further, transforming her into Darkchilde—a more demonic version of herself that features horns and cloven hooves. While she transforms back, her Darkchilde aspect helps the X-Men defeat the villain Shadow King.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFaithful Family and Mutant Memberships\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPiotr “Peter” Rasputin, AKA Colossus, is Illyana’s older brother and he often seeks to protect his little sister when he can. For Illyana, Colossus is her moral compass.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCosmonaut Mikhail Rasputin is Illyana’s oldest brother but he apparently dies. Illyana later encounters him when she is telepathically enticed through time by him. There, in hoping to save her from her death, he infects her with a virus hoping her darker side develops an immunity to it and she is sent back in time without her memory.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIllyana joins the New Mutants and X-Men as Magik when she leaves limbo and often protects human and mutantkind with her teleportation powers and mystical knowledge. While on the New Mutants team, she befriends Kitty Pryde and they eventually share what amounts to a psychic bond. Magik and the other New Mutants are later manipulated into joining Mojo’s Bratpack and the White Queen’s Hellions, each for a short time but they are freed from these affiliations.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIllyana Rasputin’s Record\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe X-Men later relocated to a Bermuda Triangle island, unaware it was observed by sorcerer-turned-demon Belasco. Trapped in an interdimensional limbo (aka. Otherplace, not the true Immortus-ruled Limbo), Belasco saw Illyana’s innocence as his route to freedom, telepathically luring her through a teleportational stepping disc into limbo. Via limbo’s twisted chronology, this Illyana of “mainstream” Reality-616 was actually the second (or latter) Illyana to arrive in limbo, with Illyana of Reality-8280 having traveled there sometime in limbo’s “past.” Reality- 8280’s X-Men followed their Illyana there, becoming trapped while she somehow escaped. Reality-8280’s Logan/James Howlett, AKA Wolverine, and Colossus died, their Kitty was transformed into the feral warrior Cat, and their Kurt Wagner, AKA Nightcrawler, and Ororo Munroe, AKA Storm, studied magic and were corrupted; Storm later won back her soul, creating an idyllic garden as a symbol of redemption. After Illyana-616 arrived, soon followed by her X-Men, Storm-8280—determined to prevent a tragic repeat of past events—helped the new arrivals escape, but this time Belasco snatched Illyana.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRequiring five bloodstones (already possessing one) to free his N’Garai masters and win his own release, Belasco swiftly tainted Illyana’s soul with evil to create a second bloodstone; however, Storm and Cat took Illyana back to Storm’s garden. Reasoning that the corruption now rooted within Illyana could never be removed, Storm planned to teach the child magic to combat it. Cat\n\nangrily disagreed and fled with Illyana that night, intending to return her to Earth via a portal in Belasco’s citadel. Cat and Illyana traversed limbo on foot for nearly three years, during which time Cat taught her to fight and they became close friends. Belasco caught them after they entered his citadel, turning Cat into a nearly mindless pet and having Illyana conjure a third bloodstone as her first act as his apprentice.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter two years of tutelage, being punished by Belasco’s chief enforcer S’ym whenever she disappointed her master, Illyana’s mutant powers emerged. Her natural affinity for time travel and teleportation focused itself in limbo’s stepping discs, and she slipped back in time, witnessing a younger Storm battle Belasco, who feigned defeat so that Storm would complete her corruption by failing to show mercy. Returning to the “present,” Illyana saw Storm fighting Belasco to free her, and when Cat fatally wounded Storm, Illyana was forced to slay Cat. Belasco demanded Illyana damn Storm for eternity by making a bloodstone from her soul, but Illyana killed Storm to prevent this. Enraged, Belasco used more of Illyana’s soul to make the fourth bloodstone, then trapped her in an icy waste. Hoping to reclaim her soul, Illyana tried to follow Storm’s example and create life, but she continually failed until she realized that, unlike Storm, she wanted revenge. Drawing from her own soul, she created a sword as the ultimate expression of her magical powers, shattering the enchantments trapping her. Teleporting to Belasco’s citadel, she fought him, growing increasingly demonic as she gained the upper hand; however, mindful of Storm’s mistake, she stopped short of killing him, thus regaining her humanity. Belasco belittled her “weakness” as Illyana teleported back to Earth-616, where she found her seven-year exile had been mere seconds for the X-Men. Uncertain of how to explain her sudden aging to her parents, Illyana became a permanent member of the X-Men’s household.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt first, the now-teenage Illyana kept quiet about her time in limbo, not wanting to shock her friends further with the revelation she was a demonically tainted mutant sorceress. She also secretly feared Belasco would retrieve her and the bloodstone medallion she had taken, unaware he had departed limbo after his foe Kevin Plunder, AKA Ka-Zar, defeated him. Now almost the same age, she became best friends and roommates with Kitty Pryde. Their bond grew so strong that their souls became literally and inexplicably intertwined. On Illyana’s birthday, S’ym invaded Xavier’s School and fought its young students, the New Mutants. Illyana subdued him and he swore fealty to her, making her effectively ruler of limbo in Belasco’s absence.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSoon after, the Hellfire Club’s White Queen Emma Frost kidnapped Kitty; with the X-Men unavailable, Illyana revealed her powers to the New Mutants, joined them as Magik, and together they rescued Kitty. Some of Magik’s teammates, notably Roberto da Costa, AKA Sunspot, and the religious Rahne Sinclair, AKA Wolfsbane, were disturbed by Illyana’s sorcerous background, but it was Magik who was most worried that her soul might be forfeit, especially when magical armor began spontaneously manifesting after a battle against the Demon Bear, spreading further across her body each time Illyana drew her sword. To her joy, however, Peter unconditionally accepted her new magical nature after learning of it when she helped the X-Men battle Dire Wraith mages.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSoon after, Illyana’s magic proved vital in defeating the mutant Wraith/human Jimmy Marks, AKA Hybrid. After Hyborian mage Kulan Gath possessed a human host and transformed New York into a Hyborian realm, Sorcerer Supreme Dr. Strange tapped Illyana’s time-affecting ability, drawing the super-Sentinel Nimrod from an alternate future (Earth-811, the “Days of Future Past”) to slay Gath’s host just prior to the possession, diverging Gath’s Hyborian city into the alternate Earth-8591 timeline.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSubsequently, Illyana was telepathically enticed through time by Mikhail, teleporting with the New Mutants several years into the future where they encountered their future selves. Noticing her own absence, Illyana discovered that she would eventually be returned to childhood before dying from the Legacy Virus. Mikhail told Illyana that he hoped to save her by removing the disease before it spread, but she discovered too late that he had infected her in the hope that the demonic side her de-aged future self had lacked might develop immunity.\n\nTheir memories of the future erased, the New Mutants returned to the past.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe immensely powerful Beyonder later detected the demonic taint within Illyana and drew it to the surface, transforming Magik into the cloven-hooved, horned Darkchilde. Though she soon reverted to human, thereafter extreme emotions or extensive use of her magic would trigger the change again. Despite this concern, Magik played a key role in saving her teammates from the mind-controlling Shadow King. During a brief side-trip to ancient Egypt with Dani Moonstar, AKA Mirage now Moonstar, Magik helped the sorceress Ashake defeat the mage Heka-Nut. After visiting Asgard to battle Amora the Enchantress&nbsp;and Loki, the former of whom briefly separated Illyana’s Darkchilde from her and gave it physical form, the New Mutants encountered the Beyonder again. He offered to cleanse Magik of her dark side, but when she and the New Mutants rejected him, he killed them, erasing them from existence, though he soon restored them. Dying traumatized most of the team, and the school’s new headmaster, Max Eisenhardt, AKA Magneto, unknowingly psionically influenced, transferred the New Mutants to the White Queen’s care. They briefly joined her Hellions, and she telepathically repressed their trauma, but the subconscious taint remained, which in Magik’s case strengthened her darker side. Learning he had been manipulated, Magneto came for his errant students, and proper counseling eventually helped them come to terms with their recent experiences.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLater, the New Mutants again fell prey to external manipulations when interdimensional media\n\nmogul Mojo transformed them into members of his mind-controlled Bratpack. Soon freed, the New Mutants subsequently rescued the X-Men when Mojo next targeted the school’s elder team, an act the youths viewed as their graduation. When Mr. Sinister’s Marauders massacred\n\nthe underground Morlock community, Magik teleported the X-Men into their tunnels but was\n\nordered to evacuate survivors rather than help fight. Against orders, the New Mutants returned to help, but were attacked by Magus, father of their techno-organic teammate Warlock. Magik teleported the team to limbo to escape, but Magus followed, infecting S’ym with a transmode virus; this turned S’ym techno-organic too, spurring him to lead a demon rebellion. Magik regained some control by sheathing her Soulsword in limbo’s soil, but each time circumstances forced her to draw it again, S’ym gained ground. Maire O’Connell, Belasco’s first apprentice, sought Magik’s help to regain her mortality, only to be slain by S’ym.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter teleporting Colossus to Dallas to aid the X-Men against the demonic Adversary, Magik helped the New Mutants defeat the insane geneticist the Dr. Frederick Animus, AKA Ani-Mator, but not before he slew Doug Ramsey, AKA Cypher. Mourning, the New Mutants returned home to watch in horror as the X-Men died live on television, willingly sacrificing themselves to power a binding spell cast by their ally Forge to contain the Adversary. Unaware the X-Men had been immediately resurrected, an enraged Magik attacked Forge, but Wolfsbane convinced her to spare his life.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSoon after, while fleeing the extraterrestrial pirate Spyder, Magik teleported the New Mutants into limbo but was attacked by S’ym’s forces. S’ym’s demonic rival N’astirh convinced Magik to force open a portal to Earth, permitting a demonic invasion of New York. Battling N’astirh and S’ym, Magik concluded that she would have to resume ruling limbo permanently in her Darkchilde aspect if she wished to contain the demons; however, Wolfsbane, believing Magik could be saved, used limbo’s stepping discs to retrieve a younger, untainted incarnation of Illyana (possibly Reality- 8280’s version) and brought her to Earth. Confronted by her innocent self and her brother Colossus, Magik seemingly chose to negate her time in limbo, ending the invasion. In the aftermath, only the child Illyana was found sealed within the Darkchilde’s armor. Magik’s Soulsword and armor mystically transferred themselves to Kitty Pryde, later passing through several hands until claimed by a new Magik, Amanda Sefton, the new ruler of limbo. The young Illyana returned home to Russia, but government forces later slew her parents and kidnapped her, hoping to reactivate her powers to use against the mutant Soul Skinner. Rescued by Colossus, Illyana returned to America, but she was found to be infected with the Legacy Virus and died soon after. The grieving Colossus later believed he was visited by teenaged Illyana’s ghost on Christmas Eve.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA few years later, during the Scarlet Witch’s “House of M” reality warp, Illyana was briefly resurrected. Belasco sensed her return, but could not locate her after Reality-616 was restored, becoming obsessed with possessing her again. Reclaiming limbo from Sefton, but still unable to locate Illyana, Belasco tried recreating her, but found himself only able to restore her body, not her soul; his recreated Darkchilde escaped into limbo. Convinced the “real” Illyana survived elsewhere and his Darkchilde was only a simulacrum, Belasco then transported to limbo the X-Men’s latest students, who had been with Illyana during the warp. Sensing this, the Darkchilde diverted some of them to the wilds of limbo, where she convinced them to help her oppose Belasco. Choosing the student Megan Gwynn, AKA Pixie, for her purity, the Darkchilde\n\ncreated a bloodstone out of the girl’s soul, thus allowing Pixie to create a soul dagger, which was instrumental in defeating Belasco and allowing the Darkchilde to assume control of limbo. She planned to forge the remaining four bloodstones from Pixie’s soul, but the arrival of Colossus stopped her. Ashamed to face her brother in her demonic state, the Darkchilde returned the heroes to Earth, but later attacked Pixie and the X-Men to regain her Soulsword, partially restoring her humanity.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen the anti-mutant Bastion targeted the X-Men’s teleporters, one of his agent’s weapons opened a portal to limbo, from which tentacles emerged to seize Magik and pull her in. Cannonball led a rescue team to limbo; Pixie freed Magik, who reclaimed limbo’s rulership and apologized to Pixie, promising to try and restore Pixie’s fractured soul.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThough Pixie is then captured by Project Purgatory and Magik, with the New Mutants in seeking to rescue her, return to limbo&nbsp;but are defeated by the Inferno Babies, mutants trained since infancy in limbo. Though Magik escaped with Karma and Pixie back to Earth. Magik hid her Soulsword inside Karma and teleported the remaining X-Men to limbo’s gateway but they were stopped by limbo’s Elder Gods. Using the Soulsword, Karma releases Legion’s mind who subsequently destroyed the Elder Gods, restoring the bloodstones along with Magik and Pixie’s souls. Cyclops restrained Magik after she knowingly put the team in danger and she, recognizing her role in the sequence of events, accepted.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDespite her incarceration, Colossus and Kitty sought her help to defeat Juggernaut, and later Cyclops selected Magjik to become a member of his Extinction Team though she remained a prisoner. While on missions , she wore lethal fail-safes to prevent her from escaping.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIllyana is later granted powers by the Phoenix Force alongside four other X-Men, including Cyclops, and they become the Phoenix Five. When Cyclops is defeated, the remaining members fled. Though Magik later joined Cyclops at the New Xavier School. Having interacted with the Phoenix Force (which was really an infection of nano-sentinels by Dark beast), Magik’s powers changed allowing her to channel increased energy from limbo, but Dormmamu pulled her into limbo to reveal that it in fact was destroying the dimension. &nbsp;Dormmamu then pulled the team into limbo to kill them, but they fought back and Magik absorbed all of limbo’s energy causing it, and the creatures within it, to disappear. Sending the X-Men back to Earth, she sought out Doctor Strange in the past to learn more about magic and control her mutant abilities. She helps him defeat the Empirikuland then led a new New Mutants team alongside Tabitha Smith, AKA Boom-Boom, Julio Richter, AKA Rictor, Guido Carosella, AKA Strong Guy, and Wolfsbane.",

But what started as a noble cause quickly morphed into something more sinister, as Magneto began to believe that mutants should rule over humans. Though usually at odds with Earth’s Super Heroes, Magneto has come to mankind’s aid on multiple occasions, showing there is still hope for this tragic figure… \n\n \n\nMaven of Mutants\n\nMax Eisenhardt began his life in a world amid mass turmoil and intolerance—Germany, World War II.

Growing to adulthood in the camp, Max continued to urge his fellow captives to fight for their freedom. \n\nEventually implementing a revolt against their Nazi tormentors, Max and Magda escaped and fled to a small city where they married and had a daughter, Anya.

      "biography": "Within a pocket realm in the Negative Zone, the omnipotent, enigmatic Beyonders created discrete packets of reality-altering energy that could be accessed by others and contained within force fields as Cosmic Cubes (and Containment Units of other shapes). One created by Skrulls eventually evolved into the sentient Shaper of Worlds; one created by A.I.M. was manipulated by a number of forces on Earth before it evolved into Kubik. When Owen Reece accessed one of these energy packets via an electromagnetic accident, part of the energy mutated him into the powerful Molecule Man. The remaining energy gradually gained intelligence and became the Beyonder, who studied life by transporting a number of superhumans to his creation Battleworld and later by traveling to Earth and interacting directly with its residents. The Beyonder remained unfulfilled and eventually faked his death, creating a new realm over which he acted as a god. Eventually, however, the Shaper and Kubik revealed the truth to the Beyonder about his incompleteness, and he willingly merged with Reece to become a new, complete Cosmic Cube. The Cube removed its components from Reece, expelled him back to Earth, and evolved into Kosmos, taking a female form in hopes of avoiding the violent tendencies of its past incarnation. Kubik tutored Kosmos in the nature of humanity and the universe, exploring the Celestials and other cosmic entities, as well as performing experiments on the Fantastic Four. After Reece, who had managed to restore his powers, lost his lover, he went mad and assaulted Kosmos, drawing out the essence of the Beyonder and attacking it. Reece nearly destroyed the Beyonder, but Kubik, who was actually falling in love with Kosmos, convinced Reece to restore the Beyonder’s essence to Kosmos to save her life. Kubik and Kosmos parted ways under unrevealed circumstances, and the Beyonder’s personality sought dominance over Kosmos. She somehow became mortal but her diminished capacities and heightened sensations drove her mad. After slaughtering 64,000 Shi’ar colonists, she was incapacitated by the Imperial Guard telepath Oracle and placed in stasis in the Kyln space prison. Now known as the Maker, she regained consciousness but has only fragments of memory. She caused great chaos in the Kyln until subdued by Thanos and his new ally Skreet. Realizing that slaying Kosmos would unleash the Beyonder on the universe, Thanos shut down her mind but arranged to have her body kept alive forever via neurology-exempt nanocellular regeneration, serving as a living prison to the mad omnipotent within her.",

      "biography": "POWERS\n\nMakkari  possesses &nbsp;the &nbsp;conventional abilities of the Eternals of Earth. His body is augmented by cosmic energy &nbsp;and &nbsp;he &nbsp;has &nbsp;total &nbsp;mental &nbsp;control &nbsp;over &nbsp;his &nbsp;entire &nbsp;molecular structure. He is virtually immune to injury, can regenerate his entire body &nbsp;as &nbsp;need &nbsp;be, &nbsp;and &nbsp;is &nbsp;immune &nbsp;to &nbsp;disease, &nbsp;aging &nbsp;and &nbsp;extreme temperatures. &nbsp;Only &nbsp;total &nbsp;molecular &nbsp;dispersal &nbsp;can &nbsp;kill &nbsp;an &nbsp;Eternal. Makkari &nbsp;has &nbsp;altered &nbsp;his &nbsp;physical &nbsp;features &nbsp;over &nbsp;the &nbsp;years, &nbsp;including alterations to his pigmentation, hair and eye color, and musculature.\n\nMakkari is the fastest Eternal known to exist. Prior to his regeneration by the Dreaming Celestial, Makkari could travel beyond the speed of light, but risked placing himself out of sync with normal space/time by reaching his highest speeds. Makkari sacrificed most of his powers (including &nbsp;molecular &nbsp;rearrangement, &nbsp;flight &nbsp;and &nbsp;energy &nbsp;projection) to &nbsp;achieve &nbsp;these &nbsp;higher &nbsp;speeds. &nbsp;Since &nbsp;his &nbsp;regeneration, &nbsp;Makkari’s optimum speed is not known, but is likely Mach 3. Makkari normally wears &nbsp;a &nbsp;bodysuit &nbsp;with &nbsp;helmet &nbsp;that &nbsp;can &nbsp;withstand &nbsp;the &nbsp;rigors &nbsp;of &nbsp;high velocity movement. Via pure manipulation of gravitons, he can levitate himself and others at up to 850 mph. Additionally, he can teleport, but seldom utilizes this power because of the discomfort it causes him.\n\nMakkari &nbsp;is &nbsp;telepathic, &nbsp;able &nbsp;to &nbsp;cast &nbsp;low-level &nbsp;illusions, &nbsp;and &nbsp;can rearrange the molecules of other substances, including his uniforms. In combat, Makkari can wield cosmic energy to enhance his physical strength (lifting up to 50 tons) and durability and can release energy from his hands and eyes in the form of heat, light or concussive force. At maximum intensity, he can vaporize solid matter. Like most of his fellow Eternals, thanks to Sprite’s manipulation, Makkari is currently mortal &nbsp;and &nbsp;his &nbsp;powers &nbsp;are &nbsp;not &nbsp;at &nbsp;full &nbsp;strength, &nbsp;though &nbsp;they &nbsp;remain formidable &nbsp;compared &nbsp;to &nbsp;most &nbsp;superhumans. &nbsp;He &nbsp;will &nbsp;regain &nbsp;his &nbsp;full abilities &nbsp;after &nbsp;his &nbsp;next &nbsp;death, &nbsp;when &nbsp;he &nbsp;will &nbsp;be &nbsp;reborn &nbsp;in &nbsp;an &nbsp;Eternal body again.\n\n\nORIGIN\n\nMakkari &nbsp;is &nbsp;one &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;Eternals, &nbsp;an &nbsp;evolutionary &nbsp;offshoot of &nbsp;humanity &nbsp;created &nbsp;by &nbsp;experiments &nbsp;performed &nbsp;by &nbsp;the &nbsp;enigmatic Celestials. Born around 2500 BC in the capital of Olympia to Verona and &nbsp;Mara &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;Technologists’ &nbsp;Guild, &nbsp;Makkari &nbsp;took &nbsp;an &nbsp;interest &nbsp;in speed at an early age, allegedly learning to run before he could walk. Makkari often joined his fellow Eternals in clashes with their enemies the &nbsp;Deviants &nbsp;and &nbsp;was &nbsp;evidently &nbsp;present &nbsp;during &nbsp;the Trojan War &nbsp;(13th century BC). Although Makkari learned engineering from his parents and was even tutored by the human philosopher Plato (423-348 BC), he primarily applied the sciences to his passion for speed, designing various high-speed vessels for travel. In the times of ancient Greece and Rome, Makkari was often mistaken for the Olympian god Hermes (Roman &nbsp;name &nbsp;Mercury). &nbsp;Makkari &nbsp;was &nbsp;occasionally &nbsp;diverted &nbsp;by &nbsp;a repeated romantic involvement with Sersi, a fellow Eternal, and once saved her from the Great Fire of Rome (64 AD). In the 6th century AD, Makkari served some time as charioteer to Darius, governor of Persia. Other &nbsp;events &nbsp;in &nbsp;human &nbsp;history &nbsp;Makkari &nbsp;was &nbsp;said &nbsp;to &nbsp;have &nbsp;witnessed include the reign of Vlad the Impaler, now the vampire Dracula (1448-1476), and the Battle of the Alamo (1836).\n\nIn 1940, the Deviant Warlord Kro had taken up various guises amongst humanity &nbsp;to &nbsp;sow &nbsp;discord, &nbsp;including &nbsp;the &nbsp;role &nbsp;of &nbsp;Rudolph &nbsp;Hendler, dictator &nbsp;of &nbsp;Prussland. &nbsp;The &nbsp;leader &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;Eternals, &nbsp;Zuras, &nbsp;assigned Makkari to guard humanity from Kro’s schemes. To conceal his true nature &nbsp;Makkari &nbsp;at &nbsp;first &nbsp;called &nbsp;himself &nbsp;Mercury, &nbsp;but &nbsp;soon &nbsp;adopted the &nbsp;alias &nbsp;Hurricane &nbsp;and &nbsp;pretended &nbsp;to &nbsp;be &nbsp;one &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;Olympian &nbsp;gods. During his 1940s adventures, Makkari used the human guise “Harry Kane” and befriended the rotund “Speedy” Scriggles, who admired his friend’s superhuman speed. In addition to his repeated clashes with Kro, Makkari also investigated a crooked carnival, held back criminals with designs on the Midville Daily Star newspaper, halted construction saboteurs and defended heiress Florence Grey from would-be killers. Makkari &nbsp;continued &nbsp;his &nbsp;pursuit &nbsp;of &nbsp;Kro &nbsp;into &nbsp;the &nbsp;1950s, &nbsp;taking &nbsp;a &nbsp;brief respite to educate the soon-to-be-famous performer Elvis Presley. By the late 1950s, Makkari became Jake Curtiss of the National Security Agency and gathered Ulysses Bloodstone, Dr. Druid and Zawadi into the Monster Hunters in order to halt Kro’s schemes to breed armies of rampaging monsters. At one point in this adventure, Makkari claimed to &nbsp;be &nbsp;Adam &nbsp;Clayton, &nbsp;a &nbsp;man &nbsp;afflicted &nbsp;with &nbsp;superhuman &nbsp;speed &nbsp;which ultimately &nbsp;claimed &nbsp;his &nbsp;life, &nbsp;but &nbsp;later &nbsp;revealed &nbsp;himself &nbsp;to &nbsp;the &nbsp;Monster Hunters as Hurricane. The Monster Hunters remained active as late as &nbsp;1958 &nbsp;when &nbsp;they &nbsp;aided &nbsp;the &nbsp;heroes &nbsp;who &nbsp;would &nbsp;later &nbsp;become &nbsp;the First Line in battling super-criminals hired by the Skrull invader Zuhn. In the late 1960s, Makkari was invited to join the First Line by team member &nbsp;Pixie, &nbsp;a &nbsp;fellow &nbsp;Eternal; &nbsp;he &nbsp;called &nbsp;himself &nbsp;Major &nbsp;Mercury during this time.&nbsp;\n\nIn recent years, Makkari joined the Eternals in probing the Fourth Host of the Celestials, which had come to judge humanity’s worthiness. As tensions over the Celestials’ presence flared, the Olympian Gods were led &nbsp;into &nbsp;a &nbsp;war &nbsp;with &nbsp;the &nbsp;Eternals, &nbsp;during which &nbsp;Makkari &nbsp;clashed &nbsp;with &nbsp;Hermes. The &nbsp;battle &nbsp;was &nbsp;ultimately &nbsp;called &nbsp;off and &nbsp;the &nbsp;Fourth &nbsp;Host &nbsp;eventually &nbsp;judged in &nbsp;mankind’s &nbsp;favor. &nbsp;Soon &nbsp;after, &nbsp;many Eternals elected to leave Earth and seek a new destiny among the stars. Makkari was among those who remained behind and sought out the Eternal philosopher Master &nbsp; Elo &nbsp; to &nbsp; teach &nbsp; him &nbsp; how &nbsp; to challenge the limits of his speed abilities; Makkari &nbsp; eventually &nbsp; streamlined &nbsp; his abilities, &nbsp;sacrificing &nbsp;many &nbsp;of &nbsp;his &nbsp;powers to become faster. In his first test run after increasing &nbsp;his &nbsp;powers, &nbsp;he &nbsp;encountered the hero Quasar (Wendell Vaughn), who later helped him rescue Master Elo from the Deviants. Makkari took the human guise of Mike Khary in order to move amongst Quasar’s civilian friends. During this time, Makkari was among the speedsters recruited &nbsp;by &nbsp;the &nbsp;Runner, &nbsp;an &nbsp;extraterrestrial &nbsp;racing &nbsp;enthusiast. &nbsp;The Runner pitted many of Earth’s fastest runners against each other in a race to the moon; though he outraced other notable speedsters such as Speed Demon, Whizzer (Stanley Stewart) and Quicksilver, Makkari narrowly &nbsp;lost &nbsp;the &nbsp;contest &nbsp;when &nbsp;the &nbsp;extradimensional &nbsp;racer &nbsp;“Buried Alien” appeared and claimed victory.\n\nIn &nbsp; Makkari’s &nbsp; time &nbsp; with Quasar he aided his friend against menaces including Maelstrom &nbsp;and &nbsp;the &nbsp;Soul-Eater &nbsp;(K’rll), &nbsp;but &nbsp;eventually departed &nbsp;so &nbsp;that &nbsp;he &nbsp;could investigate &nbsp; the &nbsp; herd-like people &nbsp;of &nbsp;Grosgumbeek, among &nbsp;the &nbsp;fastest &nbsp;species known &nbsp;to &nbsp;exist. &nbsp;Schooling at &nbsp; the &nbsp; feet &nbsp; of &nbsp; native Huyenneyuh, Makkari unlocked &nbsp;new &nbsp;secrets &nbsp;to increase &nbsp; his &nbsp; speed. &nbsp; He enlisted &nbsp;in &nbsp;another &nbsp;of &nbsp;the Runner’s &nbsp;races &nbsp;and &nbsp;was reunited with “Buried Alien,” now &nbsp;called &nbsp;Fastforward. &nbsp;In &nbsp;this &nbsp;race, &nbsp;Makkari &nbsp;was &nbsp;challenged &nbsp;by the &nbsp;Runner &nbsp;himself &nbsp;but &nbsp;won &nbsp;using &nbsp;the &nbsp;Grosgumbeek &nbsp;technique. Unfortunately, &nbsp;Makkari &nbsp;found &nbsp;that &nbsp;due &nbsp;to &nbsp;a &nbsp;side &nbsp;effect &nbsp;of &nbsp;this &nbsp;power, he &nbsp;had &nbsp;difficulty &nbsp;returning &nbsp;to &nbsp;the &nbsp;normal &nbsp;speed &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;space/time continuum. The Grandmaster, one of the Runner’s fellow Elders of the Universe, offered to cure Makkari’s condition at the cost of 3,000 years of servitude. Makkari declined, instead receiving aid from Fastforward in monitoring his condition.&nbsp;\n\nIn &nbsp; &nbsp;recent &nbsp; &nbsp;years, &nbsp; &nbsp;the mischievous &nbsp;Eternal &nbsp;Sprite sought to become mortal by tapping into the power of the Dreaming Celestial (Tiamut the Communicator), a rogue Celestial &nbsp; that &nbsp; slumbered beneath &nbsp;San &nbsp;Francisco &nbsp;for 20,000 &nbsp;years. &nbsp;Using &nbsp;the Celestial’s &nbsp;power &nbsp;to &nbsp;warp reality, &nbsp;Sprite &nbsp;transformed himself &nbsp;into &nbsp;a &nbsp;mortal &nbsp;and &nbsp;simultaneously &nbsp;converted &nbsp;the &nbsp;rest &nbsp;of &nbsp;the Eternals’ &nbsp;population &nbsp;into &nbsp;human-like &nbsp;forms &nbsp;with &nbsp;no &nbsp;memory &nbsp;of &nbsp;their prior &nbsp;lives. &nbsp;Makkari &nbsp;became &nbsp;Dr. &nbsp;Mark &nbsp;Curry, &nbsp;a &nbsp;physician. &nbsp;Makkari’s old friend Ikaris retained some sense of his true self and sought out “Curry,” but did little more than intrigue him. While attending a party at the Vorozheikan Embassy alongside fellow amnesiac Eternals Druig, Sersi and Thena, Curry’s life was threatened by terrorists, resulting in a partial reactivation of his powers. Curry pieced together a link between himself &nbsp;and &nbsp;Sprite &nbsp;and &nbsp;sought answers &nbsp;from &nbsp;him. &nbsp;Sprite &nbsp;led Curry to the Dreaming Celestial and tricked him into attacking it, setting &nbsp;off &nbsp;a &nbsp;feedback &nbsp;system that &nbsp;prevented &nbsp;Eternals &nbsp;from harming Celestials. Awakened, the Dreaming Celestial established &nbsp; &nbsp; a &nbsp; &nbsp; telepathic rapport with Makkari, restoring his &nbsp;memories. &nbsp;The &nbsp;Dreaming Celestial &nbsp;claimed &nbsp;that &nbsp;it &nbsp;had personally &nbsp;created &nbsp;Makkari &nbsp;in ages past and thus retained an interest in him, choosing him to communicate &nbsp;with &nbsp;rather &nbsp;than Ajak, the Eternal who normally conversed &nbsp;with &nbsp;Celestials. &nbsp;The &nbsp;Dreaming &nbsp;Celestial &nbsp;warned &nbsp;Makkari that &nbsp;a &nbsp;species &nbsp;of &nbsp;extraterrestrial &nbsp;“locusts” &nbsp;called &nbsp;the &nbsp;Horde &nbsp;were &nbsp;on their &nbsp;way &nbsp;to &nbsp;Earth &nbsp;and &nbsp;that &nbsp;only &nbsp;a &nbsp;judgment &nbsp;from &nbsp;the &nbsp;Celestial &nbsp;in Earth’s favor would save it. Makkari elected to remain as the Celestial’s communicator as his fellow Eternals continued to seek out and awaken the remainder of their ranks. Makkari took up residence with Sersi in her San Francisco loft for the duration. While his communion with the Celestial &nbsp;has &nbsp;placed &nbsp;a &nbsp;great physical &nbsp;and &nbsp;psychic &nbsp;strain &nbsp;on Makkari, &nbsp;the &nbsp;Celestial &nbsp;insists he will not harm the speedster and &nbsp; that &nbsp; he &nbsp; has &nbsp; specially modified &nbsp;Makkari &nbsp;for &nbsp;this &nbsp;task, also enhancing Sersi’s powers so she can serve as Makkari’s protector. &nbsp;Meanwhile, &nbsp;jealous of &nbsp;Makkari’s &nbsp;new &nbsp;rapport &nbsp;with this &nbsp;Celestial, &nbsp;a &nbsp;treacherous Ajak &nbsp; has &nbsp; sought &nbsp; Makkari’s destruction, aided by his pawn Gilgamesh the Forgotten One.",

      "biography": "Malcolm Colcord was a young soldier whose first assignment was to the Canadian government's Weapon X research facility. Only two weeks into his duty, the mutant Wolverine, a captive of the program, broke out, killing most of the people around him. Malcolm found that he survived the attack, although he was severely disfigured with scars across his face.Assigned to a desk job, Malcolm continued to serve his government, but he believed himself a joke in his government office, ridiculed and forced to work in a back office. Still, he dared to propose the renewal of one of the most controversial military projects ever, the Weapon X program, promising to use mutants for mankind's benefit, even if that meant performing deadly missions and interning mutant captives. As the Director for the new program, he oversaw the recruitment of many villainous mutants, including Sauron, Mesmero, Agent Zero, and Marrow, and eventually, Sabretooth and Aurora. Within months, the Director helped create an internment camp for mutants, dubbed Neverland, using mutants as hunters for the victims and in keeping the mutants imprisoned.Aurora had often tried to seduce the Director for her own purposes. However, an encounter with Sabretooth left her disfigured and injured, and it was only with the Director's financial and emotional support that she recovered, albeit scarred like him. Aurora began to have genuine feelings for the Director, although he refused to reciprocate.When the Director's ex-wife was to be remarried, the Director took Sabretooth, conditioned to be under his mental control, with him to confront her. The Director was about to kill his ex-wife, but his children stumbled onto the confrontation. Initially afraid that his scarred complexion would horrify them, the children reached out for their father. The Director allowed his ex-wife to live, forbidding her to ever be with another man, to which she reluctantly conceded. The Director bade Sabretooth to capture her fiancé and return with them to the Weapon X program.Afterwards, unable to deny another urge, the Director entered Aurora's bedroom, and the two kindled their romantic relationship. Soon, Aurora urged the Director to have surgery, and he had his scars removed. However, agent Brent Jackson, who hoped to stage a coup against the Director, confronted the Director with the idea that he was a \"mutie lover\" due to do his relationship. Too preoccupied with the idea, the Director lashed out at Aurora, beating her unconscious. Afterward, however, he apologized, explaining his conflicting feelings, and Aurora reluctantly accepted.Soon, the Weapon X program was discovered by the mutant soldier-of-fortune, Cable. Cable organized a group of mutants, dubbed the Underground, for investigating the program. He was joined by Weapon X agent Brent Jackson, who hoped to stage a coup against the Director and had formed his own resistance group with fellow agents.The Underground was able to infiltrate the Weapon X complex, ousting the Director and nearly crippling the program. The Director was nearly killed by turncoat agent Washout, and as he contemplated his escape, Colcord flew into a rage, blaming his loss of control over his recent obsession with his new face and with Aurora. Taking shards of glass, Colcord disfigured himself once more. He was rescued by Madison Jeffries and, with Colcord urging Aurora, the three escaped the Weapon X complex using Aurora's superhuman speed. Agent Jackson betrayed the Underground, taking credit for saving the program and was named the new Director of the Weapon X program by its mysterious benefactors.Soon after, Aurora sought to revenge herself on Colcord but was opposed by Jeffries. Recuperating at the abandoned original Weapon X facility, Colcord tasked Jeffries with creating a Sentinel army for him with which to resume his war on mutantkind.",

      "biography": "Katrina Luisa van Horn grew up to be a champion skier for an unnamed Eastern European country. When competing in the Winter Olympics for the first time, Van Horn overheard a male rival, Karl Lubbings, denigrate women athletes. Van Horn challenged Lubbings to a race that night, but in the course of the competition, Lubbings abruptly cut van Horn off as they skied down the mountain. In the resultant fall, Lubbings was killed and van Horn was crippled.Van Horn was driven nearly insane by bitterness and anger, and her plight was soon discovered by agents of the subversive scientific organization called Advanced Idea Mechanics (A.I.M.). Operating covertly, A.I.M. financed a militant feminist group that recruited van Horn, and the organization also secretly funded her lengthy rehabilitation process. Moreover, van Horn, who adopted the code name \"Man-Killer,\" was outfitted with a powerful exoskeleton that granted her superhuman strength. As Man-Killer, van Horn embarked on a campaign of terrorism that began with the assassination of a strongly anti-feminist Chicago mayoral candidate. In the course of this attack, van Horn encountered Greer Nelson in her original costumed identity as the Cat, but she swiftly subdued her and escaped. Journeying to New York City, Man-Killer carried out a plan to steal fissionable radioactive material from a Harlem power plant, only to be opposed by both Spider-Man and the Cat, who had followed her to New York. Man-Killer ultimately surrendered after the Cat confronted her with the fact that her A.I.M. benefactors had been men.Man-Killer was soon freed under the auspices of a splinter group of the terrorist organization Hydra. This cell had come under the leadership of the Maggia crimelord Silvermane, who filled the section chief positions with costumed criminals. Van Horn was herself appointed the head of HYDRA's assassination division. However, Silvermane was ultimately out of his depth running HYDRA, and his organization's headquarters was soon invaded by Daredevil, the Black Widow, and agents of SHIELD. Man-Killer herself was captured after the Black Widow's ally Ivan Petrovich affixed a device to her exoskeleton that deactivated it.Van Horn was freed from custody months later by Justin Hammer, who financed the reconstruction of Man-Killer's armor in exchange for a percentage of any profits she might make as well as her loyalty. Van Horn was part of a small army of supervillains in Hammer's employ who were pitted against Iron Man aboard Hammer's floating villa near Monaco. Like the other criminals present, Man-Killer was summarily defeated by Iron Man, though she managed to escape European authorities soon afterwards.Van Horn recruited a new gang of militant feminists and sought to increase her group's credibility by freeing Hildy Dawes, a former underground terrorist leader who had surrendered to the authorities after years as a fugitive. Despite the opposition of Spider-Man and the She-Hulk, Man-Killer managed to escape with Dawes. However, Dawes had no desire to escape, and, hoping to atone for her own terrorist actions, used an exposed power cable to apparently electrocute both herself and Man-Killer.Though believed dead for many months, Man-Killer was apparently alive and in hiding during this time. At some point, she was contacted by the Crimson Cowl and invited to join the sixth incarnation of the Masters of Evil. It is unclear whether or not the Cowl was responsible for Man-Killer's development of actual superhuman strength without apparent artificial aids. The Masters took in mercenary work to raise funds for the Cowl's worldwide blackmail scheme. Acting as security for the so-called Arms Merchant, the Masters battled the Thunderbolts, who were themselves members of the fourth Masters of Evil in heroic guises, and the Black Widow. Though they failed in their assignment, the Masters escaped. Much later, after the Thunderbolts' imposture had been revealed, the Masters attempted to recruit the remaining Thunderbolts who had decided to retain their heroic roles, threatening to turn them over to their other criminal adversaries if they refused. Ultimately, resenting these threats, the Thunderbolts unsuccessfully battled the core group of Masters.Shortly thereafter, Hawkeye became the Thunderbolts' leader, and the team decided to capture the Masters of Evil in hopes of establishing for the public their noble intentions. Despite being confronted by the entire 25-member lineup of the sixth Masters, the Thunderbolts succeeded in defeating them all and thwarting their scheme to extort one trillion dollars from the governments of the world. Though most of the Masters were captured, Man-Killer was one of the three criminals who escaped the scene of the battle.Van Horn adopted a cover identity as a bartender in Colorado, but she was soon discovered by the alter ego of the Thunderbolt Atlas. Atlas remained unsure whether to expose her, but at some point Man-Killer had also deduced Atlas' identity. Atlas ultimately confronted her when he was attacked by Wonder Man as part of plan formulated by Count Luchino Nefaria. Van Horn rejected his overtures of friendship and escaped, her cover blown.Van Horn next appeared once more in the Crimson Cowl's employ. The Masters of Evil were confronted by Hawkeye and his allies Songbird and Plantman (then, Blackheath) who were searching for the legacy of Justin Hammer. Their search ended with Hammer's daughter, Justine, who turned out to be the Crimson Cowl. Hawkeye convinced van Horn and other members of the Masters of Evil to side with him against Crimson Cowl and their former allies, pointing out the dangers of the super-weapon: it was a biological toxin that had been ingested by every single villain, including van Horn, and would instantly kill them anywhere on the Earth. Hoping to throw off suspicion, Hawkeye made the villains reinvent their costumed identities, and van Horn joined his new team of Thunderbolts as Amazon.The group ultimately defeated the Cowl and her Masters of Evil, and Blackheath managed to release an antidote into the atmosphere instead. The Thunderbolts immediately fought against the Elite Agents of SHIELD, who had caught up with them and wanted the remains of Blackheath's body, although he soon revived himself. The Thunderbolts were aided by the arrival of the true Citizen V, who needed the team's immediate help with his agency's ship. The engines of the ship were of alien technology and had began distorting, threatening to suck the Earth into the null space of a white hole. Hawkeye's Thunderbolts were asked to move a great quantity of mass to plug the hole, and van Horn was instrumental in helping the team survive. In so doing, the Thunderbolts encountered the original Thunderbolts, who emerged from the void after severing the alien ship's presence from where they had been trapped on Counter-Earth. The two teams of Thunderbolts combined forces to plug the void and shunt the alien ship from Earth, similar to the manner in which Zemo's team stopped the threat on Counter-Earth. After much discussion, most of the costumed heroes and villains chose to part company, including van Horn, who never considered herself a hero to begin with.As simply Katrina, she tried to break into a gem vault but was apprehended by Spider-Man. Before she could be picked up by the authorities, she was rescued by agents of Rey Trueno, who organized an underground fight club called the Unlimited Brawling Championship. Van Horn joined the club, although she remained very antagonistic to her coach and others. She briefly joined other club fighters in a “Spider-Man Revenge League,” but she dropped out of the League and the Championship before ever confronting Spider-Man again.Instead, she was recruited by Baron Zemo and MACH-IV to form a counterpart to the new Thunderbolts. Zemo hoped to use the team to force the Thunderbolts to sacrifice the life of Photon, whose existence threatened the future of the universe. During the battle, she confronted Atlas, surprising everyone by displaying growth powers given to her by the Fixer. Although she was defeated, Zemo succeeded in killing Photon. Afterwards, Man-Killer parted company with the Thunderbolts.",

      "biography": "Allegedly, before Earth was formed, a creator being from before time spawned the Fallen Stars, each an embodiment of one of its thoughts. On Earth, the creator made a woman, Cleito, representing the nature of reality. Cleito spawned Adam K'ad-Mon, the first Man of Lineage, and their birth site became the Nexus of Reality, a focal point uniting all dimensions. Descendants of K'ad-Mon served as Nexus guardians, but over time the Men of Lineage became less concerned with this mission, until eventually one man abandoned it completely: Ted Sallis.A biochemistry professor at Empire State University, the sheltered Sallis had no knowledge of his destiny and preferred books to people. The United States Army recruited him into \"Project Sulfur,\" which sought a means to survive bio-chemical warfare. Sallis developed \"Serum SO-2,\" which granted immunity to all known toxic biochemicals, but its mutagenic effects would have transformed people into monsters. Ted's friend, the free-spirited girl Sainte-Cloud, convinced him to denounce the Project, shutting it down before any serum was produced. Ted proposed to Sainte-Cloud, but she refused due to their many differences. Returning to teaching, Sallis fell in love with one of his students, Ellen Brandt, a naive and impassioned girl of nineteen; the two eloped following a secret affair. After their honeymoon, they visited the fortune teller Madame Swabada, who foretold a catastrophic change. Sallis was then reassigned to \"Project Gladiator,\" a S.H.I.E.L.D. research program based in the Florida Everglades and aimed at re-creating the lost \"Super-Soldier\" serum that had created Captain America. Working separately from his colleagues, including Drs. Wilma Calvin and Barbara Morse (later Mockingbird), Sallis modified his SO-2 formula as the basis for a new Super-Soldier serum. The subversive organization A.I.M. (Advanced Idea Mechanics) wanted the serum and conspired with a bitter Ellen, whom Ted had neglected since their honeymoon. Upon completing his new serum, Ted committed its formula to memory and burnt his records. When Ellen led Ted into an A.I.M. ambush, he fled and injected the only existing sample of the serum into himself just before his car crashed into the swamp. He should have died, but the magical energies of the swamp (containing the Nexus of Reality) combined with the serum to transform him into the hideous creature later known as the Man-Thing. His intelligence rapidly fading, he slew the A.I.M. agents and horribly burned half of Ellen's face. Unknown to Sallis, Ellen had been pregnant. Recovered by Project Gladiator agents, she underwent surgery that repaired her face, but it proved temporary. She gave her son up for adoption and began punishing herself for her crimes by surrendering to alcohol, drugs, and carnal indulgence. Maddened by the face she saw in the mirror, Ellen ended up in Massachusetts' Rosewell Mental Hospital, eventually restored to sanity by the enigmatic mystic Sorrow.A.I.M. again tried to obtain Sallis' formula, but was foiled by the Man-Thing and Ka-Zar. Man-Thing made the swamps his home and became the guardian of the Nexus of Reality. Its magic made the swamps a focal point of bizarre activity, attracting super-beings such as Wundarr and the Molecule Man. Alongside Dakimh the Enchanter, Jennifer Kale, Howard the Duck, and Korrek, warrior of Katharta, the Man-Thing foiled a series of plots to use the Nexus to merge all realities by Thog, demonlord of the realm of Sominus, and the Congress of Realities. The Man-Thing in some sense befriended Richard Rory, Ezekiel Tork, and his pet Dawg, and fought Franklin Armstrong Schist (F. A. Schist), who sought to drain the swamp in search of the Fountain of Youth; Professor Slaughter; the religious zealot Foolkiller (Ross Everbest); the Critics, afterlife agents seeking to judge the fate of suicide victim and clown Darrel Daniel; the natives of la Hacienda, home of the Fountain of Youth, whose waters nearly cured the Man-Thing and horribly mutated Schist before his death; the Glob, Yagzan, and the Cult of Entropy; the Si-Fan, alongside Shang-Chi; and the Gladiator (Melvin Potter), sent to recover Sallis' formula by Death-Stalker.Schist's wife, Vivian, hired Dr. Dane Gavin to capture or kill the Man-Thing; he chose the former, placing Man-Thing on display in the New York Museum of Nature History, where visitors' fears sent the Man-Thing on a berserk rampage through the city until Dr. Gavin and Schist's daughter, Carolyn, took him back to the swamp. Man-Thing later faced the manifested hate of Maybell Tork, the Demons of Liberation (embittered scarred war veterans), and the reality-altering Brian Lazarus. Wandering into the Port Everglades, the Man-Thing was trapped on the Marietta cargo ship and caught up in a two-century-old curse involving the satyr Khordes, the immortal crew of the pirate Captain Fate, and oceanographer Dr. Maura Spinner. Maura was a reincarnation of the former captain of Fate's crew, whom Fate had traded to Khordes in exchange for his treasure. Mistaking the satyr's benevolent intent, Maura had slain Khordes, who cursed them all. After helping convince Spinner to accept her destiny by the resurrected satyr's side, Man-Thing returned to the Everglades. The bog beast then joined old allies Korrek, Dakimh, and Jennifer Kale against the extradimensional sorcerer Klonus and warrior Mortak.In a weird twist of fate, a Man-Thing-shaped candle (created after his New York rampage) was drugged and given to Sainte-Cloud by her jilted lover Chuck, causing her to see Man-Thing hallucinations; exposed to the drug himself, a terrified Chuck badly burnt his face on the candle. After surviving an assault from his one-time victim Jackson Hunter, the Man-Thing halted the Mad Viking (Josefson)'s rampage. He then heeded the tortured spirit of student Edmond Windshed, taking vengeance on Edmond's former tormentors. Captured by townspeople and thrown into a sewage treatment plant, Man-Thing escaped and slew the Mad Viking, ending a violent book-burning crusade by the Viking and Olivia Selby. Now able to survive longer away from the swamp, the Man-Thing was brought by Richard Rory to Georgia, where he escaped. He fought the demon Erthold, the soul-stealing Scavenger, and Thog, whose Nightmare Boxes threatened to plunge all reality into madness until the positive wills of Ted Sallis and Steve Gerber contaminated the boxes, foiling Thog, whom Man-Thing incinerated. Alongside Ghost Rider (John Blaze), Morbius, and the Werewolf (Jack Russell) in a one-time \"Legion of Monsters\" alliance, Man-Thing helped destroy the enigmatic Starseed, actually a would-be savior of humanity. After again fighting the Molecule Man, the Man-Thing was captured along with the Glob by the Collector, who pitted them against the Hulk before they rebelled and escaped. Man-Thing later helped psychic Andrea Rodgers restore her fragmented personality, helped thwart the inane cosmic menace Bzzk'Joh, drove off D'Spayre, destroyed Jude the Entropic Man and Victorius, allied with the Cult of Entropy (narrowly missing a chance to regain his humanity), and encountered the extradimensional Micronauts. Sallis's mind was nearly restored by Dr. Karl Oheimer's cerebral regeneration therapy for a CIA project; but the army suspected enemy involvement and tried to protect Sallis's serum by attempting to rescue Oheimer, who was slain in the process. The sentient Man-Thing slaughtered all others involved, but once back in the swamp his mind faded. Another experimental project briefly transported him to the Himalayas, where he encountered a Yeti race descended from Cro-Magnons. The sorcerer Baron (Karl) Mordo returned him to the swamp, restored Sallis's mind and used him as a pawn against Dr. Strange in a plot to destroy Earth, but Jennifer Kale helped the Man-Thing throw off Mordo's control and foil the plot, though Sallis's mind again faded.After aiding Howard the Duck against the mad monopoly of Kong Lomerate, the Man-Thing befriended Sheriff John Daltry and Barbara Bannister, alongside whom he again met Captain Fate and opposed yet another Thog plot. This time, Sallis was cured and writer Chris Claremont took his place as the Man-Thing, destroying Thog. Dr. Strange restored Claremont, but Sallis's curse returned and proved irreversible. The Man-Thing was possessed by Unnthinnk, one of the demon coven called the Six Fingered Hand, who battled the Defenders in a massive plot to take over Earth; the Hand turned out to be pawns of the Hell-lords (Mephisto, Satannish, Thog, Satan ) in a scheme to use the Nexus in an aborted attempt to merge Hell and Earth. Alongside Thor he opposed the Man-Beast and Bi-Beast, then briefly served as a pawn of the mad sorcerer Ian Fate, leading to another rampage through New York. Back in the swamps, Sallis refused an offer from the demon Eblis to become human in exchange for his mortal soul. The government's Project: Glamor developed a version of Sallis's formula, planning to attack Russia with super-soldiers, but these warriors were destroyed by the Man-Thing and others. Another Sallis serum derivation, SS-8, was used by Daemian Wainscroft, mutating his son Deke into a powerful form until being functionally lobotomized by the Punisher. Alongside the Hulk, the Man-Thing encountered a new Glob (Sumner Beckwith), and was later nearly destroyed by the Deviant Ereshkigal when she used the Star Brand to access the Nexus in an effort to rule all reality. Another writer with reality-warping powers used the Man-Thing to complete his final story in the last seconds of his life. Shortly thereafter, the Man-Thing was one of the \"Daydreamers\" joining Franklin Richards on a surreal journey to accept Onslaught's seeming destruction of Franklin's parents, who had actually survived in the Counter-Earth of a pocket realm created by Franklin; however, Ashema the Listener--a Celestial who would help Franklin retrieve Onslaught's victims and establish Counter-Earth as a real planet orbiting opposite Earth--obliterated the Man-Thing in order to stop him from blocking access to the pocket realm. Re-created via the combined energies of an Asgardian Norn stone and the recent breaching of the dimensional barriers, the Man-Thing's form was briefly usurped by mailroom employee Carl Schuffler, who was removed by Spider-Man using instructions from the virtually omniscient Authority. Recent dimensional travel had shattered the Nexus of Realities, and Dr. Strange recruited Ellen Brandt to help Man-Thing restore it. In the process, the Man-Thing was possessed by K'ad-Mon, the history of the Men of Lineage was revealed, and Sallis learned that his relation with Ellen was predestined to restore his hereditary mission. Ellen, the Man-Thing, and K'ad-Mon recovered Nexus fragments from within the maddened Devil-Slayer (Eric Simon Payne), from Howard the Duck (despite the opposition of Mahapralaya and a revived Cult of Entropy), from Cleito herself in ancient Atlantis, and from a Nexus-created planet that Ellen had to destroy to save reality. Their efforts to restore the Nexus were opposed by the Fallen Star Mr. Amodeus Q. Termineus, the embodiment of finality, who had visited the young Ted Sallis over the years. Termineus had captured Ellen's long-lost son Job Burke and trained him as his disciple in a plot to destroy all existence. Devil-Slayer united the remaining Fallen Stars-including K'ad-Mon and Sorrow-to stop Termineus. Using the power of the final Nexus fragment, Termineus succeeded in shattering the healing Nexus, wiping out all reality. However, Sallis' nature as the Man of Lineage (combined with his love of Ellen) allowed him to briefly maintain the dream of existence; he joined forces with Job, who rebelled against his mentor to re-imagine the creator's dream that had formed reality. All existence was restored, with Ted and Ellen inhabiting the Nexus itself, while K'ad-Mon retained control of the Man-Thing. Job returned home with his adoptive parents to live his life and prepare for his future destiny. Termineus began to plot anew to bring about the endgame, but as it was he who had involved K'ad-Mon in this struggle, he had to deal with bringing about his own failure, due to his inability to relinquish the love in his heart for his former wife, Sorrow. Shortly thereafter, the ancient Scrier mutated one of his cabal into the Outrider to seize the Nexus. Spider-Man helped foil this plot, and Ted and Ellen drew the consciousness of the Nexus down into the Man-Thing, merging into a powerful collective being.This merged being left the earthly sphere, becoming the new Nexus, and the magic of the swamp re-formed the Man-Thing's original form, apparently instilling it with the residual memory of Sallis's consciousness. Continuing its subconscious mission to defend the swamp and Nexus, it incinerated botanist Owen Candler, creator of the Salavation Seed and the Union, which had threatened to replace humanity with plant simuloids; slew a mad scientist who tried to use the Man-Thing in experimental emotion therapy; and even opposed a universe-menacing, virtually omnipotent Thanos enhanced by the Heart of the Infinite. Eternally cursed with a monstrous form, barely aware of its past or surroundings, the Man-Thing remains the most startling slime creature of all.",

      "biography": "Born circa 1920, the future Mandarin was raised by his embittered aunt following his parents’ deaths, and as an adult he used his brilliance and family wealth to attain prominence in the Kuomintang Party’s reign over China. The Communist Revolution of 1949 cost him his position and power, although the population he had once commanded still regarded him with nigh-mystic awe. After years of seeking some means of regaining greatness, he ventured into the mysterious Valley of Spirits, where he discovered the millennia-old wreckage of a starship of the reptilian Kakaranatharian, or Makluan, extraterrestrial race, and the ten mighty rings which had powered the vessel. Unaware that the Makluans themselves remained at large, posing as humans, the Mandarin spent decades mastering Makluan technology, then several years more conquering the valley’s adjacent villages and establishing a network both of citadels and of loyal followers such as Po, Yu, and Li Fong. His long-range goal was to conquer China, and then the world, which he claimed he would rule with the “wisdom and harmony” of his nobleman ancestors. During these years he fathered a son, Temujin, whom he sequestered in a remote monastery, and took the girl later known as Madam Macabre as a student; another girl, Mei-Ling, became betrothed to marry him in adulthood. He also discovered the dormant alien robot Ultimo within a volcano, and worked for years to revive him using a combination of science and magic.In recent years, seeking assistance to master the Makluan rings’ full power, the Mandarin became the patron of the Sin-Cong revolutionary Wong Chu, who abducted the Chinese genius Ho Yinsen and American industrialist Tony Stark. However, Yinsen sacrificed his life to enable Stark to escape and overwhelm Wong Chu’s forces using his first Iron Man armor. After disciplining Wong Chu for his failure, the Mandarin had the opportunity to stop Iron Man from departing but, intrigued, allowed him to pass unhindered, little realizing the armored hero would become his most persistent nemesis. Several months later, Iron Man visited China to investigate the Mandarin for the U.S. government. Using the rings and his own combat skills, the Mandarin nearly defeated Iron Man, who nonetheless outwitted him and escaped. Soon after, the pair again clashed when the Mandarin pulled Stark surveillance missiles from the sky to use for his own purposes, then manipulated the Chinese government into test-firing a missile which, unknown to them, was intended to trigger world war, but Iron Man defeated him both times. Affected by Doctor Doom’s Emotion Charger, the Mandarin next joined many other super-villains in attacking the Fantastic Four’s Richards-Storm wedding; later, he recruited the Swordman, whose sword he equipped with greater technological weaponry, to serve as his spy within the Avengers, but the Swordsman ultimately balked at destroying the Avengers and betrayed him.Finally activating Ultimo, the gloating Mandarin teleported Stark to his citadel to observe the supposed triumph, but Iron Man lured the giant back into the volcano, temporarily imprisoning him. Later, Iron Man again prevented his foe from provoking world war with a second missile scheme. Reactivating Ultimo and rehiring the Swordsman, along with Living Laser, Power Man (later Atlas of the Thunderbolts), Enchantress, and the Executioner, the Mandarin launched an effort to empower a world-wide hate-ray, only to be foiled by the Avengers. He next mentally controlled the Hulk and used him to wreak havoc, thinking each nation would blame the other for the behemoth’s attacks, but his control was disrupted by Nick Fury and Yuri Brevlov of S.H.I.E.L.D. Undaunted, the Mandarin, now accompanied by the adult Mei-Ling, used a Hulk robot to abduct Stark’s lover Janice Cord while framing Stark himself for enemy conspiracy, but Mei-Ling, touched by Cord’s love for Stark and disillusioned by the Mandarin’s cruelty, sacrificed her life helping Iron Man defeat him. A second attempt to control the Hulk with the help of the Sandman also failed, as did efforts to foment unrest by abducting peacemaker Dr. Robert Hoskins, who was rescued by Captain America.Hoping to enhance his rings’ already phenomenal power, the Mandarin manipulated the Royal Family of Inhumans into obtaining the mystic Eye of Yin, created centuries ago by Makluan-trained sorcerers, but he was overpowered by Black Bolt, who absconded with his rings. After allying himself with the former Russian super-operative Unicorn, the Mandarin regained the rings via a Makluan headband device and returned his attention to Tony Stark. In the identity of Gene Kahn, he stirred unrest among Stark’s employees, then, when exposed, fought Iron Man alongside the Unicorn. However, careless use of the headband inadvertently switched the Mandarin’s consciousness with that of the terminally ill Unicorn, and he quickly abandoned the fight to rectify the situation. Adding insult to injury, he discovered that a rival mastermind, the Yellow Claw, had, at the prodding of the extradimensional Black Lama, seized his current base, one of his Chinese castles, in his absence. Retiring to an underwater base, the Mandarin captured Sunfire and forced him to power the machinery that restored him to his rightful body, but even with Ultimo’s aid, regaining his castle was not so simple. Iron Man and Sunfire intervened in the conflict, which ended with the Mandarin seemingly slain by the Yellow Claw’s robot surrogate, the Makluan rings claimed by the Claw’s servant Loc Do.However, the Mandarin’s new control of his consciousness enabled him to transfer his intellect into the rings themselves, and he remade Loc Do’s body into a younger version of his own. Despite his new body, his customary schemes to foment world war were once more thwarted by Iron Man. Efforts to obtain Wakanda’s Vibranium via the resurrected Killmonger proved no more successful, and his attempt to destroy China’s rice crops, intended to drive the Chinese government into invading other nations, was disrupted by an alternate Iron Man (Stark’s temporary replacement Jim Rhodes). Later, while experimenting with his rings, the Mandarin was rendered comatose; although he recovered physically, he was left amnesiac when elderly Chen Hsu, the millennia-old captain of the disguised Makulans, stole and replaced one of his rings, still tied to his consciousness and thus necessary to restore his memory fully. As Zhang Tong, the Mandarin, still driven by a need for conquest, became a criminal overlord in Hong Kong, allowing ten underlings to use his rings as his operatives in the so-called Hand. Having no memory of his grudge against Stark, he sought to force a business alliance but was again foiled by Iron Man, who nonetheless found himself unable to interfere with his opponent’s criminal network. Soon afterward, the Mandarin joined several other masterminds in the so-called “Acts of Vengeance” anti-superhero conspiracy, then allied with Matsuo Tsurayaba of the ninja Hand, but these endeavors were disrupted by the Avengers and the X-Men, and subsequent worldwide attacks on crime prevention specialists were ended by Nick Fury’s intervention. Eventually recognizing Chen Hsu’s theft, the Mandarin confronted the old man, who returned both his ring and his memory, then guided him in commanding the gigantic Makluan dragon Fin Fang Foom, with whom the Mandarin soon seized control of one-third of his native land. Tony Stark and James Rhodes, both armored as Iron Man, intervened, but the Mandarin turned against Hsu and Foom upon learning that the Makluans wanted to rule Earth themselves; with Stark channeling his own armor’s power through the rings, the Mandarin seemingly destroyed the Makluans, but his hands were burned off in the process. Eventually recovering, he grew new reptilian hands and recovered his rings, then discovered the Thuviskaroth of Cataphylaxis, a.k.a. the Heart of Darkness, a centuries-old talisman of cosmic evil. Forced through a psychological gauntlet in which he overcame personifications of his earlier schemes, he emerged near-mad with supernatural power and, in a departure from his usual methods, mystically reverted China to its medieval state, supposedly saving the world from the corruption of the technology he had commanded so long, with the assistance of the superhuman Avatars. While War Machine (Jim Rhodes) and Force Works fought the Avatars, Iron Man penetrated the Mandarin’s defenses and infected him with a techno-organic virus, nullifying his Heart’s mystic bond and again rendering him amnesiac as the janitor Chu.Regaining his identity, the Mandarin rebuilt his power base once more, clashing with Squirrel Girl and using the Espionage Elite, the Dreadnoughts, and others to undermine Stark, whom he now knew to be Iron Man and of whose capabilities he was unsure following the hero’s revival from the Onslaught crisis. Aboard his immense aircraft, the Dragon of Heaven, the Mandarin invaded Russia using a mercenary army fought by the Avengers and Winter Guard, but this was merely a pretext to lure Iron Man into action and better test him in battle. Although satisfied Iron Man indeed remained a worthy adversary, the knowledge seemed to do the Mandarin little good when Iron Man destroyed the Dragon of Heaven’s power source, toppling it from the sky. The Mandarin was seemingly slain in the disaster, but this may be only the latest of the many seeming deaths from which he has returned.",

      "biography": "A Violent BeginningMantis can trace her roots back to the family of Vietnamese crime lord Monsieur Khruul. She was the daughter of Khruul’s sister, Lua, who married the German mercenary Gustav Brandt. Khruul did not approve of the nuptials and pursued the couple before killing Lua, blinding Gustav, and burning down their house. However, Lua had born a daughter, and the now visually-impaired Gustav fled with her, the last remnant of his wife.Gustav and his infant daughter found sanctuary in the temple of the Priests of Pama, renegade pacifist members of the alien Kree race who were caretakers of the Cotati, a telepathic race of sentient plants. The Priests granted Brandt psychic sight, but removed his daughter from his side, afraid she’d be influenced by his violent nature as she grew. Gustav ended up leaving the Temple and joining the crime cartel Zodiac as Libra. Believing Mantis might grow to be the Celestial Madonna and mother the genetically perfect Celestial Messiah, the Priests of Pama trained her in martial arts, which she mastered, and gave her the name “Mantis” in recognition of her skill in defeating male opponents. They also taught her telepathic communication with the Cotati which gave her empathic abilities.The Shao-Lom monks of Saturn’s moon Titan, whose teachings also stemmed from the pacifist Kree’s beliefs, mentored another possible Celestial Madonna: Earth-born orphan Heather Douglas, later known as Moondragon. But her sheltered life denied her insight into human existence and made her a less-rounded candidate. Moondragon would eventually return to Earth, becoming involved with the Avengers after losing in battle to Mantis, thus confirming that she is not the Celestial Madonna.On her 18th birthday, the Priests removed Mantis’s memories, implanted false memories of an orphaned, impoverished life in Ho Chi Minh City, and sent her to experience life among normal humans.One Powerful MindWhen it comes to her full range of powers, Mantis has complete control over her body. This gives her peak human agility, the ability to accelerate healing through force of will, and an empathic nature enabling her to communicate telepathically with the Cotati and sense the emotions of others as psychic vibrations. She can also control her heart and respiratory rate as well as blood flow. Her mastery of the Priests’ martial arts, which focuses on the manipulation of nerve endings and pressure points, has enabled her to knock out beings as powerful as Thor. Mantis has two slim antennae growing from her head that amplify her telepathic and empathic abilities.Mantis also gained abilities when she merged with the Cotati, such as being able to communicate with both plants and animals, something she calls “biopathy.” She can also survive in space in a physically solid “energy” or astral form and transfer herself (and her son) from plant-life-to-plant-life across interstellar distances or dimensions, creating new bodies from the plant life of where she arrives.Her mind itself is a human/planet hybrid, which is largely immune to mental or metaphysical assault, and her physical durability is greatly enhanced. It can also transmit and receive telepathic impressions that can affect all of the receiver’s senses. Mantis’ mind has also been known to have precognitive powers and has received flashes of future events. Combined with her meditative nature, this allows her to view and plan for unpleasant events with an impassivity and ruthlessness that others find unnerving. Unpredicted deaths can overwhelm her empathic nature, and it is in moments of peace after unexpected disasters that her emotions are often released.Since her rebirth, she can fire powerful pyrokinetic energy blasts, form energy fields, communicate directly with cosmic beings such as Eternity and Death, and completely control her personal energies as well as her physical form.Sensing TroubleWhile not an outright enemy, Scarlet Witch becomes an adversary of Mantis when Mantis discovers she has romantic feelings for Vision, whom Scarlet Witch ends up marrying. The love triangle is so bad that Mantis leaves the planet the day of the wedding.Over the course of her life, Mantis gains enemies in Loki, Dormammu, the Collector, Klaw, Ultron, and the Mad Titan Thanos. In particular, Thanos tries to destroy Mantis and her son Sequoia, a dangerous move that leads directly to his own defeat.Kindred SpiritsMantis is well-known for her membership in the Guardians of the Galaxy, but she starts out as a one- or two-person act in the beginning of her hero career, particularly when she helps reform the villain known as Swordsman (Jacques Duquesne). This is enough to grant her entry into the Avengers on Earth.Upon leaving Earth in the form of pure energy, she travels the stars and finds a romantic ally in Norrin Radd. Together, they fight the Elders and Gardener. Mantis becomes a member of the Guardians following the defeat of the Phalanx techno-organic transmode virus. Peter Quill (Star-Lord) becomes a “frenemy” when he uses her to manipulate the rest of the team.",

      "biography": "The full details of Sarah’s early history remains unrevealed prior to her joining the underground community of Morlocks. She was a young child living with the Morlocks when they were targeted by the agents of the evil Mister Sinister, the Marauders, who began massacring the community. Although the X-Men managed to thwart the Marauders, scores of mutants were killed. Sarah was one of the few who survived, as she was rescued by Gambit (the leader of the Marauders to the tunnels.) Over the years, the Morlock tunnels were occupied again. Sara somehow ended up back in the tunnels, and she was raised by their leader Callisto into a young woman.Years later, the Morlocks' tunnels were flooded by the mutant Mikhail Rasputin, but not before he teleported a select group of the Morlocks away to another dimension. Sarah, now calling herself Marrow, became the leader of a faction of the Morlocks calling themselves Gene Nation. She led Gene Nation in a mass murder at a New York club before being stopped by the X-Men.With her companions, she eventually confronted Storm, who was once a Morlock leader, in a one-on-one battle on the anniversary of the Marauders’ invasion. Sara threatened to blow up New York's subway system, along with a hundred commuters, as payback for the mutants killed. During their battle, Storm was forced to pull out Marrow's heart to stop the bomb that was attached to it. Believing that she was dead, Storm left her in the tunnels; however, Marrow survived, having two functioning hearts as a part of her mutant physiology. After a while, Marrow resurfaced at a party with Callisto at her side, briefly clashing with Storm and her ally Cable. During a massive attack on the nation's mutants by the government's Operation: Zero Tolerance, Marrow and Callisto were ready to kill anti-mutant activist Senator Robert Kelley, but they were stopped by the hero Spider-Man. A few days after, Marrow decided to get back at humanity by slaughtering everyone at a police department. However, the X-Men's Iceman and the mutant Doctor Cecilia Reyes were nearby, ambushed by the robots on behalf of Operation: Zero Tolerance, the Prime Sentinels. Marrow saved the two and joined them in confronting the Operation's leader, Bastion, and stopping his plans. The threesome returned to the X-Men's mansion headquarters, and Marrow was invited to stay with the team.Marrow remained filled with hatred in regard to the world, humanity and the X-Men, whom she referred to as the \"Beautiful People\" due to the fact that they are mutants who happened to be normal looking. Her anti-social behavior caused major problems in the X-Men. The X-Men's Wolverine took it on himself to rehabilitate Marrow, which often sparked more fights than it solved. Shortly after this incident, Marrow revealed that she was spending double duty, healing the wounded Callisto in the Morlock tunnels while living with the X-Men. She became close to teammate Archangel, with whom she had a Christ-fixation from witnessing his struggle during the Mutant Massacre. Eventually, Marrow began to mellow somewhat and was confronted by her teammates about hiding her insecurity behind a wall of hate and violence.Later, during a time-travel adventure with the team to the alien Skrull homeworld, Marrow was mortally wounded and put in a healing matrix. When she came out, Marrow was transformed into a beautiful young woman with apparent control over her mutant power. Marrow continued to adventure with the X-Men, and soon displayed the ability to retract her bone spikes into her body, although it still took extreme concentration. At one point, she and Colossus were captured by Mikhail Rasputin. Marrow confronted Mikhail and blamed him for making her the psychopath she had become, although, in a surprising move, she spared his life. After several more adventures with the X-Men, Marrow had learned enough control over her powers and personality that she left the team to pursue an university education.At some point, however, Marrow was discovered by the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D. and brainwashed into becoming one of their undercover agents. She maintained an identity Sarah Rushman, student at Empire State University and waitress. Marrow apparently killed a record producer and was confronted by the hero Spider-Man before escaping. Spider-Man again confronted Marrow, learning that she was actually tracking down and destroying life-like androids on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D. Marrow was still consumed with self-loathing, and despite Spider-Man's attempt to help, she threw herself off of the Brooklyn Bridge.Somehow, Marrow survived her fall and found her way to the mysterious Weapon X program, a clandestine organization associated with experimentation on superhuman beings and with mercenary activities. Presumably, her powers were becoming uncontrollable once again and she needed help. The Director of Weapon X used an experimental procedure in slowing and stopping Marrow's bone growths, granting her a normal human appearance for the first time. Marrow was then asked to perform an assassination on the program's request, but she refused. She instead went out on the town and met a guy named Junichi, and for the first time in her life felt comfortable being intimate. Upon returning to Junichi's place, however, he revealed himself as Mesmero, an agent of Weapon X sent to watch over her. Furious, Marrow beat Mesmero to a pulp, and killed her target, just to prove herself. She returned to Weapon X and joined their mercenary team.Over time, Marrow began to suspect that the agents of the Weapon X program were not told everything about the program and its ultimate motives. Capitalizing on this suspicion, she was approached by the agent Brent Jackson, persuaded to join a group he was forming to stage a coup with the Director. Marrow agreed, and Jackson's allies joined the mutant team Underground, led by the soldier-of-fortune Cable who hoped to take down the Weapon X program. The Underground was able to infiltrate the Weapon X complex, ousting the Director and nearly crippling the program. However, before the final defeat, agent Jackson betrayed the Underground, turning Cable's psychic powers against his allies. Jackson captured the Underground members and altered their memories to erase everything they saw and learned about the program. Marrow, in the meantime, had escaped to personally confront Weapon X's former member Sabretooth, although Sabretooth escaped when a burst of water accidentally carried him away. Marrow returned to rescue the members of the Underground and return with them to their base.However, this proved to be a front, as Marrow tricked Cable into believing that the Underground was successful, thereby gaining information about the various Underground cells around the country. She then proceeded to convert the Underground cells into a new version of Gene Nation, hoping to once again create a mutant terrorist army. Marrow and Gene Nation were systematically hunted down by Weapon X's operative Agent Zero, who killed every member of Gene Nation but left Marrow alive to humiliate her.Following the advent of \"M-Day,\" when the majority of Earth's mutants were depowered, a still-powered Marrow returned to the Morlocks to help in their hour of need.",

      "biography": "The daughter of Scott Summers and Jean Grey in an alternate timeline, young Rachel Summers inherited her mother's potential for telepathic and telekinetic powers she possessed as Marvel Girl of the X-Men, a team of mutant adventurers fighting for peaceful coexistence between mutants and humans.In the mainstream reality, the X-Men prevented an attempted assassination of anti-mutant Senator Robert Kelly. However, in Rachel's timeline, Kelly was killed. The assassination caused intense widespread public paranoia against mutants, and, in the next presidential election, an anti-mutant candidate won. His administration unleashed giant mutant-hunting robot Sentinels to eliminate mutantkind, and the Sentinels decided that the best way to do so was to take over the United States. Over the subsequent years they killed or imprisoned virtually all known superhuman beings within North America.One day, whilst Rachel was still a child, the X-Men's base of operations at Professor Charles Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters was attacked and demolished by federal troops. The only survivor at the school was Rachel, whom the soldiers found by the side of Xavier's body. They used drugs to neutralize her developing psionic powers before she was tortured and brainwashed in the laboratory of the sadistic Ahab. Following extensive behavior modification, Rachel became a mutant \"hound,\" using her psionic powers to hunt down other mutants for the authorities. Rachel's superiors branded her face with a grotesque pattern of tattoos to mark her as a hound, and forced her to wear a leash. Rachel occasionally killed mutants herself, and it is known that some of those were people she loved. Rachel's grief and shame at what she was forced to do as a hound, and her anguish over the deaths of her parents and friends deeply scarred her soul, leaving her bitter and intolerant toward humans who persecute mutants.Eventually, Rachel was placed in the South Bronx Mutant Containment Facility where she rejoined the surviving members of the X-Men in a plan to end the Sentinels' reign by changing history. Rachel used her psionic powers to exchange the consciousness and spirit of the adult X-Man Kate Pryde with that of Pryde's teenage self as she existed at a time just before the attempt on Kelly's life. It was hoped that the adult Kate, in her younger self's body at that earlier time, could warn the X-Men about the assassination attempt so they could stop it, thereby preventing the chain of events from occurring that led to the Sentinels' rule. However, history cannot be changed in this manner. Rachel, as it turned out, actually caused Kate to exchange psyches not with her younger self in the past of her own reality, but in the mainstream reality. Kate succeeded in preventing Kelly's assassination in the mainstream reality, after which the Pryde's psyches returned to their proper times and realities. On her return, Kate found that other X-Men, except for Rachel, had all died in an attack on the Sentinels' Manhattan headquarters.Kate still did not give up her vain hope of altering her reality's history. She hypnotized Rachel into using her psionic powers to tap into the Phoenix Force and send herself back in time when Kate said the words \"Dark Phoenix\". Thus Kate hoped that Rachel herself could change history. Together, Kate and Rachel illegally entered the laboratory of Project Nimrod, which was the attempt to construct the most highly advanced Sentinel possible with the technology of that time, in the hopes of sabotaging the project. Pursued by guards, Kate and Rachel locked themselves within the laboratory, whose walls were proofed against Kate's mutant power to phase through solid matter. Rachel believed herself and Kate to be trapped, but Kate said the words that caused Rachel to project herself back through time. Project Nimrod's creation, the Sentinel called Nimrod, then killed Kate and travelled back in time to find Rachel.Rachel found herself physically transported, body and mind, to a time shortly before the present. But, like Kate's spirit, Rachel had traveled not to the past of her reality, but to the past of the mainstream reality. She went to Xavier's mansion, but could not bring herself to stay on realizing that she had come back to the wrong reality, and fled without identifying herself. Pursued by the psychic vampire Selene, Rachel was rescued by the X-Men. After Xavier read her mind, she was invited to join the team.Rachel was shocked to learn of the supposed \"death\" of Jean Grey in this reality. Visiting the home of Grey's parents while they were absent, Rachel found a holo-empathic crystal that was imbued with an imprint of Grey's personality. Unaware that Jean had not actually been Phoenix, Rachel refused to believe that Jean could be evil, as people claimed Phoenix was, and she decided to claim the name and power of Phoenix as her own birthright. Through her own actions, Rachel sought to redeem the name Phoenix in this reality. Rachel also believed that as the new Phoenix she could use her power to help her fellow mutants, and thereby atone for what she had done as a hound in her own reality. It was at this moment while holding the crystal that Rachel first manifested about her the bird-shaped aura of energy associated with the previous Phoenix. From that time on, Rachel was able to draw to a limited extent upon the vast power of the cosmic entity known as the Phoenix Force. The alien being known as the Beyonder once hinted that Rachel could potentially become equal in power to the previous Phoenix. Indeed, the Beyonder once granted Rachel the full power that the previous Phoenix had possessed, but he reclaimed it shortly thereafter.Soon after, Rachel's teammate Wolverine severely injured her to prevent her from vengefully murdering Selene. Fleeing to heal herself, she was fooled by the six-armed sorceress named Spiral and taken to the alternate dimension of Mojoworld where she was held prisoner for several months. Rachel eventually escaped to London where she was tracked by agents from Mojoworld. With the help of Kitty Pryde, Lockheed, Nightcrawler, and Captain Britain, Rachel defeated her would-be captors and together they formed the British super-team Excalibur.After many adventures with Excalibur, Rachel finally managed to return to the future she had come from. While she couldn't change her past, she and her teammates were able to change the directives of all the Sentinels of the era to preserve all life, thereby ending the genocide that had prevailed for years. On the return journey, Captain Britain was lost in the timestream and it was discovered that Rachel had to exchange places with him for him to return. She accepted, and was carried to another future time that was ruled by the eternal mutant Apocalypse. There, Rachel founded the Clan Askani to help in the struggle against Apocalypse's tyrannical reign.As the Mother Askani, Rachel was responsible for transporting her parents to the future to care for Cyclops' infant son Nathan, who had been taken to the future in the hopes of curing a techno-organic virus that Apocalypse had infected him within the past. The Clan Askani saw in the infant the potential to be a great warrior, and trained him to become the soldier known as Cable. The effort of transporting the two X-Men exhausted Rachel's frail old body and her physical form died, leaving her to live on in an astral form.Sometime later, Cable journeyed to the end of time and found a youthful Rachel being held prisoner by Gaunt, a man who had been imprisoned there for his crimes. Cable challenged Gaunt to a duel to decide the fate of Rachel and emerged victorious, returning Rachel to the present with him. With her own timeline erased and having been abandoned by the Phoenix Force, Rachel decided to retire from the costumed adventuring life and began attending college. Soon after, Rachel became embroiled in the Dark Sisterhood's attempted takeover of the United States. Rachel aided Cable in defeating the Sisterhood and their leader, Finality, after which she returned to college.Months later, Rachel was captured by the mutant predator Elias Bogan who used her as his pet telepath, enslaving other mutants to do his bidding.  After Bogan's defeat at the hands of the X-treme, X-Men team, Rachel was freed from his telepathic control and rejoined the X-Men, taking the codename Marvel Girl to honor the memory of her mother.\nShe has also changed her last name to \"Grey\" becoming Rachel Grey possibly to express disapproval at her father's continuing relationship with Emma Frost, though she and Emma have made a truce of sorts during one of the team's missions in Hong Kong. After House of M and Decimation, where most of the world's mutants lost their powers, the government had Sentinels instituted at the X-Mansion to protect the mutants in case any enemies used this low point to attack. Though their intentions were good this time, it reminded Rachel too much of the previous timeline when Sentinels herded mutants into concentration camps.Rachel spent some time with her grandparents, bonding with her grandfather. At a family reunion with all her relatives, a commando unit under the order of the Shi'ar attacked the party, killing everyone including Rachel's grandparents, in hopes of wiping out the Grey genome. Though unable to kill her, they were able to graft a deathmark on her back that would allow them to find her wherever she went. Afterward, at the graves of the Grey family, Rachel vowed a terrible vengeance on the Shi'ar.Even after swearing a vow of vengeance on the Shi'ar Professor Xavier recruited Rachel to come on his mission to stop her uncle Vulcan from destroying the Shi'ar, Since the event that revealed Vulcan was Rachel's uncle, Professor X spent much time with Rachel in order to teach her to hone her skills as a telepath and improve them since Professor X had lost his powers. Professor X recruited Rachel along with her uncle Havok, Nightcrawler, Warpath, Darwin and Polaris in a space mission to stop her paternal uncle Vulcan from destroying the Shi'ar empire. Xavier, who recently was stripped of his powers, recruited Rachel to serve as his telepathic \"eyes and ears\" during their mission. Aware of Rachel's vendetta against the Shi'ar, Xavier has agreed to use their trip into space to find out who in the Shi'ar Empire gave the order to wipe out all members of the Grey family and has warned Rachel that they will deal with the people responsible for her recent losses Xavier's way.While in space, the team was attacked by Korvus, a Shi'ar warrior sent to kill Rachel. Korvus's ancestor Rook'shir was a previous host of the Phoenix Force, and a small portion of the Phoenix's power was left behind in his sword, the Blade of the Phoenix. With this power, Korvus made short work of the other X-Men, but when Rachel blocked the sword their minds were involuntarily linked and Rachel learned that Korvus's family was also murdered by the Shi'ar government because of their connection to the Phoenix.  Part of the Phoenix power from the sword was transferred to Rachel. Rachel claimed that rather than having taken the power, the power chose to go to her. When this happened, Rachel's normally gold energy aura turned blue, the same color as the Blade of the Phoenix. She then telekinetically disabled an explosive implant that the Shi'ar chancellor K'tor was using to force Korvus's obedience.Due to her connecting with the sword, Rachel also connected to Korvus and the two began to share memories. Rachel discovers the Phoenix Force formerly in the blade is just an echo of the Force. This blue shadow of the Phoenix soon began influencing Rachel's behavior, causing her to design a darker new uniform and begin a romance with Korvus. Not long after these events, Vulcan took the life of his father Christopher Summers, both Rachel and Korvus joined the Starjammers, to stop the evil Vulcan.",

      "biography": "Mary Jane Watson was the guiding light in Peter Parker's life, and their love had overcome countless obstacles.  But her upbringing certainly gave her no reason to believe in happiness. Her parents, Madeline and Philip, met at high school and married aged eighteen. Madeline followed her strong-willed husband across the country as he began his academic career in modern American literature, and by twenty she had one daughter, Gayle.  Mary Jane arrived four years later.  Philip became a popular college professor and Mary Jane's mother devoted her life to their children - to the casual observer they seemed like the perfect couple.But Philip had visions of himself as a great writer, another Fitzgerald, a Faulkner... though in truth, he possessed no such talent.  Unable to accept his own failings, he turned his fury on his family.  He dragged his wife and children from college to college, searching for inspiration.Gayle Watson turned inwards, seeking solace in her ballet, while Mary Jane hid behind an exuberant personality.  At every new school, she was the class clown and party animal.  In public, nothing was ever wrong with Mary Jane, while in private, little was ever right.  Eventually, Philip's frustrations boiled over, and he struck his elder daughter over the cost of her dancing lessons.  While Madeline was prepared to endure her husband's bitterness, she would not stay to see her children suffer his violence.A few weeks later, as Philip was receiving honors during his college's awards ceremony, Madeline left home with her daughters and two suitcases.  She received nothing from the courts, and was left to shuffle from relative to relative.  For Mary Jane, life was scarcely improved.  They were resented by those who took them in, with one exception - her father's elderly sister, Aunt Anna Watson, who lived in Forest Hills.Mary Jane loved her visits with Aunt Anna, though one downside was that Anna and her neighbor May Parker were always trying to get Mary Jane together with May's nephew, Peter.  Mary Jane was thirteen when she first laid eyes on Peter, aged fourteen. Peter had just started high school, and through her window Mary Jane saw a serious-looking bookworm - kind of cute, in a nerdy sort of way.  But Mary Jane had other priorities, and other worries.Madeline Watson and her family had finally settled down in Pittsburgh, staying with her cousin, Frank Brown.  A widower, with three children of his own, Frank paid the bills while Madeline looked after the household.  Frank was harsh, but not violent, and at last the tortured family found some stability.  But while Mary Jane was breaking hearts as a high-school freshman, Gayle ignored her mother's entreaties and married her high school sweetheart - football star and honours student Timmy Byrnes.  Gayle became pregnant when Timmy was just nineteen.In Timmy's trapped eyes, Mary Jane saw the roots of the desperation which destroyed her father.  Turning away from Gayle's impending misery, Mary Jane buried herself in acting, parties, and the nation's new celebrity sensation... Spider-Man.  Mary Jane saw that she and Spider-Man shared two things in common - a determined to enjoy life, and a mask which hid their true faces.The following Thanksgiving break, Mary Jane went to stay with Aunt Anna, when a break-in at the Parker household cost the life of Peter's Uncle Ben.  In shock, May Parker had been brought over to Anna Watson's house, but Mary Jane had little stomach for the misery of others.  So it was that she watched as Peter arrived home and rushed inside.  A minute later, she could hardly believe her eyes as she saw Spider-Man crawl out of an upstairs window, off to seek revenge on his Uncle's killer.Burying that secret deep within her, Mary Jane watched as Gayle became pregnant again, and her young husband abandoned her.  She saw her own mother become sick and die.  Desperate, Gayle assumed that Mary Jane would stay and help raise the two young children, but Mary Jane saw nothing but a cage.  She ran from Gayle's life, all the way to New York.Staying briefly with Aunt Anna, Mary Jane found work waiting tables and dancing on stage in discos.  She put a deposit on a downtown studio apartment, cheap, but at last a place of her own.  In-between, she managed to avoid the date with Peter Parker that their respective aunts were so keen to arrange.  But she couldn't put it off for ever.\nPeter, expecting a dowdy girl, was stunned by Mary Jane's beauty and exuberant charm.  Mary Jane remembered a bookish, bespectacled nerd, and never imagined the confident young college student Peter had become.  Nor, when a television bulletin announced that the Rhino was at large in the city, did she expect him to suggest they ride into town on his motorcycle and catch the action.  Of course, Peter immediately disappeared to \"take photos\", and Spider-Man turned up moments later.  Mary Jane bit her tongue, and feigned surprise at these, and many such future \"coincidences\".Mary Jane dated Peter a couple more times, and became part of his circle of friends, joining Harry Osborn, Gwen Stacy, and Flash Thompson.  But Peter and Gwen fell deeply in love, and Mary Jane could offer no such commitment.  Instead, Mary Jane began casually dating Harry, though she flirted shamelessly with Peter, and others.  But when Harry developed a drug addiction, his relationship with Mary Jane suffered greatly, and it never truly recovered.With the death of Gwen Stacy and Norman Osborn, Mary Jane's friendship with Peter remained true, and she comforted him through his loss.  Harry meanwhile had become increasingly unstable, and Mary Jane abandoned him completely. Over time, Peter began to realise that there was more to Mary Jane than the \"party girl\" persona she affected.  As Peter departed on a trip to Europe, he left Mary Jane with a kiss which at last reflected the depth of feeling that had developed between them.  In her words... \"Wow!\" Over the following months, they became lovers, although Peter's commitments as Spider-Man caused no less grief with Mary Jane than they had when he dated Gwen Stacy or Betty Brant.  Even though she secretly knew the reasons for his unreliable behaviour, Mary Jane still felt the need to punish him - occasionally dating sports jocks, like Flash Thompson and others, to get her point across.Peter eventually proposed to Mary-Jane, but after consideration, she declined, saying that she wasn't the sort of girl who could be happy with just one man. Feeling uncomfortable, Mary Jane left New York for some time, and furthered her modeling career in Florida.  In her absence, Peter dated several different women, and pursued a tempestuous relationship with the Black Cat.When Mary Jane returned, both she and Peter were having some problems with their lives, and relied on one another as good friends.  But after another round of the usual Peter Parker lies following a battle with the Puma, Mary-Jane revealed to Peter that she knew that he was Spider-Man.  Since his mask was now gone, she removed hers, and told Peter about the other side of Mary Jane, and her own difficult past.  In their shared honesty, the two realised how close they had become in their lives.  A few months later, Peter proposed once more, and was accepted.They married, and shared many moments of great happiness.  But the reality of  being wedded to a super-hero was far more demanding than Mary Jane ever imagined. Between villains like Venom invading their personal lives, MJ struggle with Peter's extended absences, and the very real fear that one day, she might get a phone call saying her husband was in a morgue, dressed in a Spider-Man costume.Mary Jane's fame brought its own problems.  She was kidnapped by Jonathan Caeser, a wealthy admirer. Following her escape and his being sent to jail, Caeser still managed to use his influence to ensure that she was forced out of the modelling business. MJ managed to find well-paid work in the day-time drama \"Secret Hospital\", although she was consequently subjected to several other attacks from crazed fans.Whether at home at night, or out being the social animal her soap opera fans expected her to be, the young bride found herself increasingly alone - a super-hero widow.  She took up smoking, and was nearly tempted into an affair by smooth-talking actor Jason Jerome.  Miserable, tense, her life was a far cry from the happy carefree days before her marriage.But things started looking up for the young couple when Mary Jane became pregnant. Even more significant was the return of Peter's long-lost clone, Ben Reilly, who assumed the role of Spider-Man.  Though Norman Osborn's plans caused the loss of her unborn child, Peter and MJ undertook marriage guidance, and Mary Jane took up psychology at ESU, befriending Jill Stacy.  Mary Jane was given an opportunity to resume her beloved modelling, for which she was very well paid - a fact which caused Peter some embarrassment.  They moved into an expensive apartment, along with Aunt May.  Their happiness seemed assured.Though Ben Reilly had tragically been killed by the Green Goblin, Peter told Mary Jane that he was done with being Spider-Man, once and for all.  But the spider-bite ran deep in his blood.  While MJ's busy modeling schedule was straining their relationship, the truth came out that her husband was still Spider-Man. Their marriage on the rocks, Mary Jane faced further problems as a stalker harassed her constantly on the phone - a secret she withheld from Peter.As their love hung in the balance, Mary Jane took off on a plane trip. Pete was supposed to catch up with her and have time away to patch things up.  With the stalker on board, the plane exploded in mid-air. Peter refused to believe his wife dead, until convinced by the weight of evidence.But Peter was right the first time. MJ was held captive by \"the Stalker\", a man who supernaturally began to become like Peter after absorbing his memories. Spider-Man rescued MJ, but after the mental trauma of her captivity, she was unable to return to the lifestyle which had torn them apart.  The two separated, with Mary Jane moving to the West Coast.  After a painful time apart, the two of them recently decided to make one last move.  As Mary Jane flew to New York, Peter flew to Los Angeles.  Each finding the other absent, they returned home.  But Peter's flight was met an electrical storm, and made an unscheduled stop in Denver, as Mary Jane's plane touched down for a stopover.  The two of them met in the airport.Their reunion was nearly sabotaged when Doctor Doom arrived at the airport, a guest of the American government.  When a Latverian resistance group launched an all out attack in the waiting lounge, Spider-Man aided Captain America to defend Doctor Doom. Mary Jane could have no clearer proof that loving Peter Parker meant accepting Spider-Man.  But amongst the rubble, Peter told Mary Jane that he needed her, that he loved her, and that he was nothing without her. Watching them, Captain America could see the truth.  He offered Peter a word to the wise, from someone who had been down that road a while.  \"The mask is supposed to hide your face.  Don't let it hide your heart.\" Reunited with Peter, Mary Jane focused on developing her acting skills with serious stage performances, overcoming the stereotype of being an unintelligent supermodel.Mary Jane, Aunt May, and Peter resided in Tony Stark's tower since Peter joined the New Avengers. She has suffered watching Peter die at the hands of Morlun, only to watch him re-emerge from his own corpse reborn. She supported Peter's decision to unmask before the world in response to the Civil War|Superhuman Registration Act, despite the increased risk to her own safety. After Peter withdrew his support for the Act, she and Aunt May went into hiding. The Kingpin, learning of Spider-Man's unmasking, sent a sniper to locate and shoot the Parkers. While Peter saved Mary Jane from the gunfire, Aunt May was shot and sent into a coma. Peter desperately searched for a means to save Aunt May's life, blaming his unmasking for endangering his family. With the Parkers at a dead-end, Mephisto took advantage of the situation, offering to restore May to health if Peter and Mary Jane agreed to have their holy bond of matrimony removed from time. Mephisto also agreed to erase all memories and records of Spider-Man's unmasking to ensure May would not be simply shot by another sniper. After offering something additional in secret to Mephisto, Mary Jane selflessly agreed to the deal, believing that the love between her and Peter would be strong enough to bring them back together again. Following Mary Jane's lead, Peter consented. Now, time has been altered such that Mary Jane, though she shared a relationship with Peter, never married him, and is currently no longer romantically involved with him.",

      "biography": "Master Hate is an abstract cosmic being who embodies hatred. His true origins or how he came to exist is a mystery. Master Hate first appeared to humans when he joined forces with other cosmic entities in order to stop Thanos, who had gained control of the Infinity Gauntlet. Among those cosmic entities was his counterpart Mistress Love. During the battle that ensued Thanos managed to turn the cosmic beings into statues. However, when Nebula gained control of the gauntlet, the entities were restored to their true forms and attacked Nebula hopping to wrest the gauntlet from her grip. Nebula, however, gained too much power and stopped the entities once more. Later during the battle, Adam Warlock managed to gain control of the gauntlet and set reality straight. Another meeting of cosmic entities was called in order to decide if Warlock would be able to keep the gauntlet. Master Hate and Mistress Love attended the hearing and watched the outcome. The gauntlet was split up into the original Infinity Gems. After the hearing Hate parted ways with Love.Soon Mistress Love came into contact with a girl who had fallen in love with the Silver Surfer and granted her cosmic powers in order to be his equal. In doing so Love created Avatar, who would be Love's new avatar. However Master Hate watched from a distance and offered Avatar more power if she became his newest avatar as well. She accepted and became even more powerful. Avatar then confronted the Surfer and tried to force him to love her. However the Surfer was able to subdue her and place her in a pocket dimension. There she still waits for Master Hate and Mistress Love.Some time later, Thanos again gained immense cosmic power when he took control of the Heart of the Infinites. Hate, alongside other cosmic entities again battled him, but to no avail. The band of cosmic entities was soon waylayed by Thanos' might. Victorious, Thanos destroyed the universe. But, he had a change of heart and recreated it and everyone in it, including Master Hate. Master Hate's current whereabouts are unknown.",

      "biography": "Chris Bradley lived the life of a normal teenager until the day his mutant nature first manifested. This drew the attention of the mutant heroes the X-Men, two members of which – Gambit and Jean Grey – were sent to monitor Chris. At school, Chris found himself unable to control his electricity-based powers and was overwhelmed, falling unconscious in the school’s bathroom. He was found by Gambit and Jean who subsequently took him home. With his parents’ blessing, Chris went to live with the X-Men at their mansion home. There, Chris trained with them in the use of his powers, and began to form close friendships with several of the X-Men, particularly Iceman. Eventually, Chris proved able to control his powers, but on the eve of his return home, the X-Man Beast discovered that Chris had contracted the mutant-killing Legacy Virus. A despondent Chris still sought to return to a normal life, and although alienated from his best friend, Chris found acceptance in his classmate Donna Funaro, who did her best to understand his situation, and they soon fell in love. After public anti-mutant sentiments grew to a near-fever pitch, Chris’ parents were forced to take him out of school. On a visit to the only clinic willing to help those infected with the Legacy Virus, they stumbled upon members of the anti-mutant Friends of Humanity movement who were intending to bomb the clinic. They were saved by the mutant mercenary Maverick (Christoph Nord), who was also infected with the Virus. With the Friends defeated, Chris used his powers to help defuse the bomb. Maverick then provided Chris with contact details should he ever need Maverick’s help in the future. Later, Chris’ home was burned down by mutant-haters, and he angrily sought revenge on the Friends, whom he believed to be the perpetrators. Iceman sought to stop him, but Chris rejected his offer of help, feeling that the X-Men had abandoned him. Instead, Chris sought out Maverick, unwittingly leading the Friends to confront them. Aided by Iceman and the feral X-Man Wolverine, they defeated the Friends, after which Maverick arranged for Chris and his family to be given new identities as the Johnsons and relocated to Altamonte Springs, Florida. Maverick also had his old ally, Doctor James Keller, begin analyzing Chris’ condition.Chris settled into his new life as Brian Johnson, though the Legacy Virus soon affected his control over his powers. Eventually, Chris ran away from home to New York to be reunited with Donna, but became the target of the Friends once more. Saved by Maverick and Russian telepath Elena Ivanova, they were soon joined by Wolverine in opposing the Friends. An explosion allowed the heroes to escape, but also left Donna mistakenly believing Chris had died. For his protection, Maverick had Chris take a code-name, and he chose “Bolt.” On a subsequent visit to Keller’s clinic, Chris learned that Maverick’s powers had returned, forcing the Virus into remission. He then aided Keller in opposing a group of would-be burglars, using his powers to mask his true identity. Later, seeking to fight mutant persecution as a super-hero, Chris moved to New York and was again reunited with Donna. Soon after, Chris aided several other teen heroes in battling the alien warrior Blastaar, after which the heroes banded together as a new incarnation of the New Warriors. Initially, Chris kept his Legacy Virus infection a secret from his teammates. Having nowhere to live, Chris slept on the streets for a time before turning to Donna for help, after which she let him sleep on the floor of her room for a time. As a Warrior, Chris helped his teammates save Namorita from Genecide and her Eugenix soldiers, after which they became involved in a war between rival gangs Born 2 Die and Lobo's Boys, during which Chris’ teammate Aegis opted to save his friend James, one of Lobo’s Boys, instead of Chris, resulting in Chris being injured by a falling wall. Subsequently investigating the gang’s arms supplier, Harvey Traynor, a recovering Chris and his teammates clashed with the armored mercenaries Heavy Mettle, with Chris facing off against the energy arrows of Warbow. Traynor went to prison, where he was killed by an agent of Heavy Mettle’s employer, Silvermane. The Warriors were also involved in the “contest of champions” held by the alien Coterie, during which they bested fellow teen heroes the Slingers in a game of basketball only to be subsequently defeated in combat by the Black Panther (T'Challa). Chris and the Warriors later teamed with teen mutant heroes Generation X in opposing Fletcher Traynor, who sought revenge on the Warriors for his father’s death and was mutated by one of his father’s weapons into the monstrous Biohazard. After Biohazard’s defeat, Namorita learned of Chris’ lack of accommodation and offered him the spare room at her apartment. The Warriors next prevented an armored car heist by the Mutant Force during which Chris opposed Peeper. Media reports of the clash mistakenly referred to Chris as “Bulk,” much to his chagrin. Subsequently, the Warriors battled Heavy Mettle once more, with Chris besting the aquatic powerhouse Barracuda by electrocuting him.Later, Chris was among the world’s mutants who were temporarily stripped of their powers by the High Evolutionary’s machinations, regaining them in time to rejoin his teammates in helping the Warriors’ former leader Night Thrasher against the would-be new Iron Fist and the ninjas of the Hand. Chris and the Warriors then opposed an attempted robbery by Blizzard (Donald Gill). During the clash, Iron Man joined the fight, but subdued Blizzard so brutally that the Warriors interceded, unaware that they were actually opposing a suit of sentient Iron Man armor which almost killed the Warriors until it realized what it was doing was wrong and left. Subsequently, the Warriors were transported to the extradimensional realm of Olympus by Hercules, who sought to test them in battle. Chris took the opportunity to ask the ruling god Zeus for help in curing the Legacy Virus; however, Zeus declined to involve himself in mortal affairs. Chris ultimately told his teammates the truth about his condition, and they – along with a returned Night Thrasher - pledged their resources to finding a cure. Eventually, the X-Man Beast created a cure which was released into Earth’s atmosphere by the sacrifice of the X-Man Colossus. Soon after, an intergalactic council attempted to convert Earth into a prison planet, during which a reinvigorated Chris fought with his teammates against Spragg the Living Hill and other threats before joining many of Earth’s heroes in opposing their would-be “warden,” Ronan the Accuser, and a horde of mutated Kree soldiers.Upon learning of Maverick’s apparent death at the hands of Sabretooth, then an agent of the subversive Weapon X program, Chris swore revenge. Seeking out the mutant soldier Cable, Chris recruited his help as a combat instructor to better allow Chris to take up Maverick’s name and uphold his legacy. Chris immersed himself in the Maverick persona, doing his best to look, sound, and act like Maverick. Chris subsequently joined Cable's Underground resistance group in opposing Weapon X and its sadistic Director, Malcolm Colcord. Alongside Domino, Chris helped capture Weapon X operatives Reaper and Wildside, whom he proceeded to brutally torture in an effort to learn of Weapon X’s plans. The Underground then formed an alliance with rogue Weapon X operative Brent Jackson and a cadre of agents loyal to him in an assault on Weapon X’s headquarters, but they were ultimately betrayed by Jackson and captured. Chris escaped and battled Weapon X’s Agent Zero, unaware that he was secretly the former Maverick. After the Underground was co-opted by former Weapon X agent Marrow and restructured as Gene Nation, Chris tracked her down and confronted her. Marrow surprisingly invited Chris to join them, and he accepted, secretly intending to dismantle the organization from within. For his first mission, Chris was sent to aid in a terrorist attack on Grand Central Station. Seeking to stop the bomber, Chris was confronted by Agent Zero, who mistakenly believed him to be the perpetrator. In the ensuing confusion, Zero fatally shot Chris. As he lay dying, Chris was unmasked by Zero, who was shocked to discover he had killed his former friend. Chris died, never knowing Zero’s true identity. Recently, Chris was revived with an alien techno organic virus.",

      "biography": "As a girl, May Parker was a wild child; she once shouted a proposal to Jimi Hendrix at a concert, and at fifteen she ran away from home, sleeping in a San Francisco basement for awhile. Her family problems were presumably resolved over time, as she now has a good relationship with her mother, who retired to Florida. After marrying Ben Parker, May befriended his brother, Richard, Richard's wife, Mary, and their son, Peter. When Richard and Mary died in a plane crash around the same time May lost her own sister, whom she considered her best friend, May and Ben took Peter in and raised him as their own. May became a responsible adult, working in an office cubicle and attending PTA meetings.May's life took a tragic turn when Ben was shot dead by a burglar before her eyes. She became the sole guardian to Peter, who started acting up and keeping odd hours She comforted him when he had nightmares, but was unsure if Peter even liked her since he never seemed to be around anymore; in truth, Peter had secretly become the super hero Spider-Man. Terrified she might lose Peter too, May angrily overreacted whenever she couldn't account for his whereabouts, subconsciously pushing him away. One night, May caught Peter coming home extremely late and grounded him, but soon relented; however, reports of Peter's erratic attendance at school continued to cause her concern.After Peter befriended new classmate Gwen Stacy, May became romantically interested in Gwen's father, John - ironically, the police officer who had investigated Ben's death. When John was killed by a Spider-Man imposter and Gwen's absentee mother refused to take responsibility for her daughter, May took Gwen in. John Stacy's death prompted May to see a therapist to whom she confessed her fear of loss, her guilt over being attracted to John so soon after Ben's death, and her concern that she was only using Gwen as a way of keeping herself too busy to think about the ghosts surrounding her. She also admitted she was terrified of the chaos Spider-Man and his ilk represented, as he seemed to keep appearing during times of crisis in her life. May's therapist helped her see she needed to let herself love people without always fearing she would lose them.Realizing this seemed to give May new strength. When Peter's employer J. Jonah Jameson unjustly fired Peter, May called Jameson and gave him a piece of her mind; when Mary Jane's father accosted Peter for endangering his daughter, May again defended her nephew. She even held her ground against agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. when they took her into protective custody after several of Spider-Man's enemies escaped. However, tragedy struck again when Gwen was murdered in the Parker's backyard by the creature known as Carnage. With too many bad memories now filling their home, May and Peter made plans to move.",

      "biography": "As the queen of the Inhuman royal family, Medusa spends much of her time fighting for the right of the genetically-altered Inhuman race to exist. She stands against anyone who opposes her people, from humanity to the Kree, to other members of the royal family, like Maximus, the brother of her husband and Inhuman king Black Bolt.\n\nWith her mane of deadly red locks, Medusa commands respect. And, as Black Bolt does not speak for fear of the destructive power his voice wields, one of Medusa's main roles as queen-consort is to interpret his wishes and communicate them to their subjects.\n\nInhuman Royalty\n\nMedusa was born into the royal family of the Inhumans, and so raised as an elite, meant to be queen. However, Medusa rebelled against her strict upbringing. Though she was betrothed to Black Bolt at a young age, she flirted briefly with his younger brother, Maximus - a flirtation made easier by the fact that Black Bolt was kept in quarantined isolation for many years.\n\nMedusa began to correspond electronically with Black Bolt in his isolation and the two bonded, developing a personal sign language for communication that only they understood. She learned to interpret Black Bolt's body language and fell in love with him. After his release and the tragic death of Black Bolt's parents, Medusa grew even closer to him.",

      "biography": "Born to a gypsy family in briton, the infant mutant Meggan instinctively grew a coat of fur to protect herself from the cold, as her body's first of many metamorphosis. The travelers believed her a monster, and subconsciously she manifested the traits they imagined she possessed, such as bat wings under her arms, and webed fingers. She was kept hidden in her parent's van until age seventeen when reality-altering mutant Mad Jim Jaspers turned Britain into a fascist state where superhumans were hunted. Meggan and her father were placed in a concentration camp. When finally freed, Meggan was unable to locate her family. She hid until an encounter during the full moon led to a battle with Captain Britain; during this fight a young bystander and friend of Meggan's, Micky Scott, was killed by falling debris, and Meggan fled in anguish. After the funeral she and Captain Britain both came forward to apologize to the dead boy's family. Captain Britain offered to let Meggan stay with him and help track down her family. Meggan's hero worship grew into attraction, though Brian failed to notice. However the telepath Alison Double, another friend, realized Meggan's true powers and provided the clues to unlocking them. During a battle with R.C.X.'s Cherubim, Meggan finally appreciated her metamorphic abilities, transforming into a tall, blonde, beautiful woman, all traits Brian found desirable; romance blossomed soon thereafter on a lengthy overseas trip. On one of their stops, in Russia, Meggan demonstrated the ability to harness elemental and magical forces during a confrontation with the ancient witch, Baba Yaga.A few months after she and Brian helped found Excalibur, Meggan resumed the search for her parents, traveling to Europe with Phoenix (Rachel Summers) tracking a rumor of a \"magic creature\" hidden in a Gypsy's van. The story proved to be about a being belonging to a mystical race called the Neuri, who showed Meggan her true appearance. Subsequently, Brian was lost in the timestream. Meggan was devastated, becoming catatonic while she reached out with her empathic powers into the timestream, acting as an anchor so that Brian could be rescued. This helped Meggan master her powers even more, gaining control over the elements. Meggan stayed with Excalibur until the team disbanded after she and Brian were wed. They were called back into action to save Otherworld from destruction by the sentient computer Mastermind. After defeating Mastermind, Brian was crowned King of Otherworld, with Meggan as his queen. The pair recently returned to their own world (Earth-616) during a reality storm, and Meggan appeared to sacrifice herself to seal an interdimensional rift, thus preventing the reality disruption from spreading across the multiverse.",

      "biography": "Mendel Stromm was sickly growing up, but discovered a love of gadgetry and robots that helped him get through an unhappy childhood. As an adult, he became Norman Osborn's business and scientific partner in the early days of Osborn Industries until he was caught embezzling and Norman had him arrested. On his release from prison ten years later, Stromm wanted revenge on Osborn and sent robots to destroy his livelihood. Spider-Man stopped the robots and captured Stromm, saving him from being shot by Osborn, only to see him apparently die from a heart attack. Stromm's robots reappeared soon after which led to the discovery of the Robot-Master, a robot duplicate of Stromm, who had transferred his memories to it shortly before his \"death\". It was quickly disposed of by Spider-Man.Years later, Norman Osborn became curious about the unexpected effects of the Green Goblin formula of which Stromm had developed the prototype. He had Stromm exhumed and discovered him alive, due to the formula, although his body was a withered husk. Revived, Stromm, now Gaunt, was given a promise of rejuvenation if he carried out Osborn's plans to ruin Peter Parker. Given the use of Multivex's extensive resources by Osborn, Stromm blackmailed Seward Trainer into developing the regenerator, and hired the Hobgoblin, Arcade, and Cell-12 in a succession of attempts to either harm or kill Ben Reilly and others.\nSuccessfully rejuvenated, Stromm, clad in robot armor and calling himself the Robot-Master, attempted to kill Reilly himself, but failed. As a consequence of his failure, Osborn zapped him with a concussive blast and left him for dead. He came to with severe burns to his head and loss of memory. While wandering aimlessly, he stumbled across his original hideout and began making toy robots for hospitalized children. Unfortunately, mention of Osborn's name brought back Stromm's thirst for revenge, and he became unhinged before Spider-Man stopped him. At Ravencroft, Dr. Kafka discovered that he had no memory of the previous nine years. Stromm was treated and released. Obsessed with terminating Spider-Man, he attempted a new technique, interfacing his brainwaves with a computer that would enable him to control robots by mind power alone. The computer started to take over Stromm's mind, decapitating him, and seizing control of New York's computer infrastructure. Stromm used the small amount of control he still had to lead Spider-Man to his base underground, asking him to kill him before it was too late. With the help of Peter Parker's hacker friend Shea Tinker, Spider-Man introduced a recursive virus into the Machine, which sent Stromm and the Machine into standby, until Spider-Man could figure out a way to help Stromm permanently without killing him.Recently someone gave anonymous tip to F.B.I. where they could find Stromm. S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives found him connected to the computer and managed to remove him from the Machine. He then was given choice either register and work for them or go to jail. He happily registered and was given new robot body. He was ready to live quiet life with his new robots but he soon was visited by Penance (Robert Baldwin), who was on a quest to revenge the innocent people and his team mates in New Warriors who Nitro killed when he destroyed part of Stamford, Connecticut. He made Stromm tell the launch codes to American nuclear missiles so he could use them against Latveria where Nitro was held prisoner. In reality he just wanted the codes to lure Thunderbolts to the silo and steal their transport. Stromm was found locked into a sarcophagus that he had in his vault by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.",

      "url": "https://www.marvel.com/characters/mephisto",
      "image": "https://terrigen-cdn-dev.marvel.com/content/prod/1x/mephisto.jpg",
      "biography": "A Class Two Demon or Hell-lord, Mephisto rules a fiery nether realm that he refers to as Hell or Hades, though it is neither the Biblical Hell nor Pluto's Olympian Hades. In the distant past, Mephisto became engaged to the lover of one of his former soldiers, then manipulated that demon into slaying his lover; the demon became Darklove, cursed to always perform the opposite of love. Mephisto's realm includes the Arena of Tainted Souls where tainted souls are locked in perpetual combat. Mephisto delights in impersonating the Biblical Satan. Empowered by the souls of the damned, he often strikes deceptive bargains with the living. Mephisto takes particular interest in the souls of extremely powerful or exceptionally pure beings.\n\nLong ago, Mephisto entered a rivalry with the demonic Zarathos and struck a bargain with the young prince who eventually became Centurious, the Soulless Man. Together, they brought down Zarathos, and Mephisto began a long process of tormenting Zarathos by bonding him with mortals. Knowing Zarathos was connected to the ancient Spirits of Vengeance, Mephisto became obsessed with controlling the Medallion of Power, a mystic talisman housing the essences of the Spirits. This led Mephisto to the Kale family, who bore shards of the Medallion within their souls. In the 18th century, Mephisto bargained with the overzealous madman Pastor Kale, hoping to gain the soul of the Pastor's son, Noble. This eventually led to the creation of the Dan Ketch Ghost Rider.\n\nThroughout history, Mephisto has exploited the spiritually adrift. In Europe, he granted a group of mystics (the future Mys-Tech) immortality in exchange for a yearly quota of souls. He also corrupted sea captain Joost van Straaten, who became the infamous Flying Dutchman. Benedicto de vica Severtes once dealt with Mephisto to gain the love of Beatriz, and prevented Mephisto from claiming his soul by encasing himself in mystical armor, becoming the Brass Bishop, but after centuries of evading Mephisto, his soul was finally claimed when the hero Puck cracked his armor. Prior to World War II, Mephisto duped a group of German scientists into believing in the Vril, a perfect race that had allegedly ruled Earth before the age of man and had relocated to an extradimensional realm. These scientists developed a portal to the Vril, though their project was shut down at war's end. Surviving project member Thule secretly continued this work in the Rocky Mountain base Schamballah, assisted by a growing band of neo-Nazis.\n\nIn recent years, Mephisto has been increasingly fascinated by Earth's super-beings, and has particularly coveted the Silver Surfer's pure spirit. Mephisto tried to tempt the newly Earth-bound Surfer with power and physical pleasure, even offering up the Surfer's beloved Shalla-Bal, but the Surfer resisted. Undeterred by this failure, Mephisto has repeatedly threatened the Surfer, Thor, Daredevil and many other heroes. He sent the ghostly Flying Dutchman back to Earth to attack the Surfer, but the Dutchman renounced Mephisto. When Noble Kale's descendant Naomi Kale sought to undo the Kale family curse, she offered Mephisto her soul in exchange for his promise that the curse would not plague her firstborn son. She hoped this might break the curse forever, but Mephisto taunted her with assurances that even if her son John could not become \"the\" Ghost Rider, he could certainly become \"a\" Ghost Rider. Years later, when John Blaze turned to the occult in a futile attempt to save the life of his adopted father, Mephisto appeared to him in the guise of Satan. Claiming Blaze's soul, Mephisto bonded the human with the captured Zarathos as a new Ghost Rider.\n\nMephisto's power over the soul of Doctor Doom's mother led him into several conflicts with the Latverian monarch, battling each other annually on Halloween. Allied with fellow Hell-lords Satannish, Thog and Satan, Mephisto manipulated the demonic Six-Fingered Hand into helping him create Hell on Earth, but the non-team known as the Defenders thwarted their efforts. After Thor freed mortal souls from his Hell, Mephisto attempted to slay Thor's then-human form, Dr. Donald Blake, employing the deceased Darkoth against him, but Darkoth had no love for Mephisto, and had Thor destroy him. Mephisto has menaced the Fantastic Four on several occasions, including one involving the demonologist Elspeth Cromwell who mistakenly invoked him, allowing him to capture Reed and Susan Richards and their son Franklin.\n\nMephisto had gained tremendous power by the evil of the extraterrestrial Dire Wraiths who were invading Earth at the time, but lost this power when the spaceknight Rom banished the Dire Wraiths, and Mephisto was temporarily destroyed by Franklin. Mephisto later re-formed, missing five fragments of his essence. He tricked the villain Master Pandemonium into gathering these fragments, which Pandemonium believed to be pieces of his own lost soul, and Mephisto was eventually restored to full strength. This resulted in the destruction of the Scarlet Witch's twin sons, whom she had mystically created by unwittingly trapping and transforming two of Mephisto's power fragments. A rivalry developed with the Asgardian death goddess Hela, who stole several souls that Mephisto considered his. Scheming to force Thor to oppose Hela, Mephisto temporarily stole the souls of several heroes, including the Invisible Woman, Jean Grey and Rogue, before finally claiming the one he'd sought all along: the Thunder God's. After a series of confrontations with the Fantastic Four, X-Factor, the X-Men and the Avengers, Mephisto freed Thor's soul, but his plot succeeded. Having seen the horrors in store should the realm of death ever expand to engulf the living, Thor vowed to stand against Hela's advances forevermore.\n\nWith at least one rival neutralized, Mephisto sought other means of increasing his power. When the godlike Beyonder came to Earth seeking understanding of humanity, Mephisto attempted to sway him by offering his own warped view of mortals, sending Zarathos to test Spider-Man's morality. When Mephisto tricked the herald of Galactus, Nova, into becoming more bloodthirsty in her duties, the Silver Surfer and Galactus both opposed the demon. Galactus and Mephisto engaged in a cosmos-shaking battle that left the Hell-Lord badly beaten. More failed attempts to gain the Medallion of Power followed, as well a brief period in which Mephisto served as an advisor to Thanos, who then held the Infinity Gauntlet. Mephisto lied to Thanos about his origins, linking them to the Infinity Gems, in the hopes of gaining the villain's trust. Thule's Eye of Force eventually achieved its goal, opening a portal to the \"Vril,\" only for them to be revealed as Mephisto's demon elite. Mephisto devoured Thule as payment, but his intended invasion of Earth was thwarted by Cloak and Dagger, Spider-Man, and Ghost Rider (Dan Ketch).\n\nMephisto once stole the soul of Odin while he was in his Odinsleep, and Loki possessed Odin's form, but Odin ultimately reclaimed his body and Mephisto took Loki's soul, his true goal all along. After months in Hell, Loki's spirit eventually escaped. Mephisto empowered suicidal Chris Daniels into the superhuman Suicide, cursing him so that only the Ghost Rider (Ketch) could slay him, hoping that Suicide could force Ketch into committing murder. The demon later attempted to seduce the Silver Surfer by mimicking the form of Nova (Frankie Raye), and Mephisto ruthlessly murdered Avengers member Mockingbird after the Avengers interfered in Mephisto's clash with rival demon Satannish over the souls of the Lethal Legion. Mephisto later helped the hero Hellcat destroy Satannish.\n\nAppreciating the strength mortals drew from family and friendships, Mephisto mystically created two children for himself: a son named Blackheart, whom he deemed worthy of being his heir, and a daughter named Mephista. Mephista would wage war upon Doctor Strange, but Blackheart targeted first Daredevil and later the Dan Ketch Ghost Rider. Mephisto sought to teach his son the ways of ruling Hell, but Blackheart's ambition began to rival his own and they turned on each other. Blackheart temporarily overthrew his father and claimed the throne of Hell, but he eventually lost it to Noble Kale, who was in turn cast out by a renewed Mephisto. After reclaiming his throne, Mephisto once more began focusing on acquiring more souls for his realm. His efforts to claim the Black Panther (T'Challa) were thwarted when he was nearly overwhelmed by all of the Black Panther spirits throughout history. The Haazareth demons who granted Doctor Doom magical power against the Fantastic Four are within Mephisto's domain, and tormented Doom for their master when he offended their patronage.\n\nMephisto took advantage of Spider-Man's desperation to save his Aunt May's life, after she was shot by one of the Kingpin's snipers. In exchange for her restored health, Spider-Man had to sacrifice his marriage to Mary Jane Watson, as the demon would revel in the elimination of a sacred and holy bond of love, and Spider-Man's innate suffering (despite losing memory of the event). The couple agreed, and Mephisto altered time such that the Parkers never exchanged wedding vows. As part of the deal, Mephisto removed the knowledge of Spider-Man's secret identity from the world. Through this event, Harry Osborn was somehow restored to life.\n\n* NOTE - In the alternate future timeline of the Guardians of the Galaxy, Mephisto has a loyal daughter named Malevolence.",

Using a human host body, Mercurio had to siphon off energies from Dr. Donald Blake, whenever he transformed into the Thunder god, in order to change back to his natural alien appearance. However, Mercurio only succeeded in transforming himself into a half-negative being capable of performing new superhuman feats. He wanted to complete the transformation but was thwarted by Thor and the Warriors Three, and his body was sealed in molten iron. That was not the end of the 4-D Man for he was soon teleported away from the Earth by Xorr the God-Jewel and returned to his home world. Mercurio had then attacked Xorr to steal his energies for the survival of Garamos, but encountered Thor while he was on a quest of his own. Searching for the missing Asgardians, Sif and Karnilla, Thor found them imprisoned within the God Jewel, so he allied himself with his former enemy and defeated Xorr. Mercurio collected the fragments that made up Xorr and returned to Garamos.Mercurio had also come into contact with heroes such as Captain Marvel, Quasar and the Squadron Supreme. He has been held captive on the laboratory world of the Stranger and was most recently used as a pawn by Zarrko, the Tomorrow Man when he was pulled from the time stream to battle the newly formed Thor Corps.

The Taylor Foundation became the first corporation willing to match pharmaceutical salaries for cancer research. Dwayne Taylor himself searched out the best microbiologists. It was Zachary Smith who reached the headlines supposedly discovering a bacteria that prevented dairy products from spoiling. Within two months, Zachary Smith, after being grabbed by Dwayne Taylor, was making major headlines with his discovery of bacteria that fed off Cancer cells alone. With the Taylor Foundation skyrocketing, it was not longer after that they had learned the secret of Zachary Smith’s success.It turned out that his dairy had spoiled as soon as it left his sight, and that his cure to cancer was a complete failure, and in some cases, fatal.As it turned out, Zachary’s son was a mutant that was capable of talking to germs, and had “spoken” to the germs to do his father’s bidding, doing so unconsciously. Zachary refuses to believe it as the truth and immediately fled to a small lab in the Scottish Highlands where he swore he would never see his son again, and that he would prove to the world that they were wrong.Dwayne had eventually sought out Zachary and found him dead.

After the agency’s Esper Division sensed a sinister presence behind druidic artifact thefts, Micromax was assigned stakeout duty within the premises where robberies were predicted. When Excalibur’s Phoenix (Rachel Summers) stumbled into one of the stakeouts, Micromax assumed she was the robber, missing the real thief, an invisible minion of the mage Necrom, whom Phoenix was battling. His interference allowed the real culprit to escape. During a subsequent stake-out, Micromax clashed with Phoenix’s teammate Nightcrawler and his Technet allies, who were assisting Dai Thomas’ Inter-Regional Police Taskforce. Four days later, on a Birmingham stake-out, Micromax was knocked out by the robber, whom Nightcrawler’s team finally apprehended. When F.I.6’s Espers pinpointed the artifact thief’s controller, Micromax was disheartened to learn he was being held in reserve while others made the arrest; however, the target, Necrom, easily slaughtered the agents present. Micromax tried to save his superior, Brigadier Blott, but Necrom held him with a force field while the mage absorbed Blott’s lifeforce. When Necrom attempted to drain Wright too, Micromax rapidly shrank, passing out from the strain. Mistakenly believing Micromax dead, Necrom departed. Awakening, Micromax learned Necrom was moving to attack Excalibur, then aided the team and their allies in defeating the villain. Later representing the U.K. at the first Pan-European Conference on Super Human Affairs, Micromax was hypnotized by the Nazi Brain Drain to slay the British Prime Minister, but was stopped by Alpha Flight’s Aurora before he could do so. Meanwhile, F.I.6 was dissolved, it surviving members absorbed into rival agency R.C.X.; Micromax turned them down, preferring to concentrate on his show business career. Not accpeting his refusal, R.C.X. kidnapped Micromax, placing him in stasis alongside similarly kidnapped Excalibur members. Freed by Nightcrawler, he assisted Excalibur in forcing a change of R.C.X.’s leaders. Soon after, Micromax joined Excalibur, accompanying them into Shi’ar space to rescue their teammate Cerise. His membership was brief; offered a Security Chief post by the Brand Corporation, Micromax moved to New Jersey. After Brand fired him, he attended the Otherworld wedding of Brain Braddock (Captain Britain) and Meggan. During the invasion and subsequent occupation of Earth by the interchronal conqueror Kang and his forces, Wright defended the planet against the invaders in Europe, alongside the Avengers and other superhumans.

On one assignment, Midnight was sent to recruit the Chinese scientist Half-Face to the Si-Fan, but Half-Face refused.When Shang-Chi turned against Fu Manchu, Midnight felt betrayed by one whom he considered his brother, and fought Shang-Chi to the death in New York. Their battle ended atop winch, and when Midnight fell from the winch, his cape caught on its hook and broke his neck. Moments before his death, Midnight was taken into the realm of Limbo, by Kang the Conqueror to serve in the Legion of the Unliving he pitted against the Avengers. After the Legion’s defeat, the true master of Limbo,Immortus, returned Midnight to his own time to meet his death.Agents of the extraterrestrial Kree obtained Midknight's body and stored it on the planet Bodoni-20. Eventually, the scientist Kar-Sagg revived his brain and made a physically enhanced clone of him which retained residual memories and his full combat prowess, but he lost the capacity for speech. When the Kree needed an agent to oppose the Silver Surfer during one of their wars with the Skrulls, Kar-Sagg provided the clone, now christened the Midnight Sun. Although Midnight Sun was capable of battling the Silver Surfer, his lingering sense of honor in combat kept him from taking advantage of the Surfer.Kar-Sagg believed that Midnight Sun's memories were holding him back and attempted to purge them, but Midnight Sun resisted this, determined to learn who he truly was, and fought his way to freedom from the Kree. Journeying to Earth, he meditated over his partial memories upon the moon. When he saw the Silver Surfer leaving the Earth after an adventure, he pursued him, thinking the Silver Surfer knew something of his past; but unable to speak, he wound up fighting the Surfer. This was finally broken up by the Inhumans, who lived in the lunar city of Attilan. When they learned of the Midnight Sun's plight, they welcomed him into their city to seek some means of communicating with him. Given the upheaval Attilan has endured in recent years, Midnight Sun's present fate is uncertain.",

      "biography": "Calvin Rankin was raised by his father Ronald Rankin, who was experimenting with genetics. Once when Calvin was left alone and caused a lab accident which gave him his copying powers. His father, afraid that others would despise him went into hiding with Calvin in a cave, where his father was building a machine that would take away his powers. The villagers found this out and attacked the Rankins' causing a cave-in, killing Ronald.Years later while in college Calvin met Hank McCoy and Bobby Drake. He realized after using their powers that they were Iceman and Beast of the X-Men. He then later was in a shop were Jean Grey was. He developed telekinetic powers and realized that she was Marvel Girl. He then proceeded to follow her back to the Mansion, where he introduced himself and asked to join the X-Men. After revealing his plan to them they tussled until Calvin was able to capture Jean and hold her hostage. Calvin then took her to the cave where his father had died and planned on using the machine his father created to make the powers he copies permanent. Not realizing that it would instead take away his powers he used the machine and became powerless. Xavier then removed his memories of the X-men and Calvin returned to college.Later during a lab accident in college he regained his powers and memory of the X-Men. Seeking revenge he demanded that he become a member of X-Men. Xavier reluctantly accepted and made Calvin the deputy leader. During the next several missions Calvin faced off against Banshee, Ogre and the Factor Three. After that Calvin was offended by Cyclops and attacked him. Xavier finally fed up with Calvin's attitude kicked him off of the team. Calvin left the mansion later to find the Super-Adaptoid attacking the X-Men. Hoping to become even more powerful Calvin offered to join the Adaptoid in his plan to conquer the earth. But upon learning he would become a mindless pawn, he changed his mind and attacked the Adaptoid, losing his powers in the process.Calvin then returned to school until his powers started to return. This time however his powers where drawing the life force of those around him. Frightened he fled to Canada were his girlfriend, Vera Cantor asked Hank McCoy to help him in finding a cure. Unfortunately the Hulk felt Calvin's power and sought to destroy the source. As the Hulk grew closer Calvin started to absorb the radiation which gave the Hulk his strength. While the Hulk and Beast fought Calvin absorbed too much radiation and died of poisoning. Calvin was then buried in an undisclosed location.Years later somehow Calvin absorbed the healing factor and powers of Wolverine and was brought back to life, believing himself to be Wolverine. He again encountered the Hulk and later learned that his father was connected to Weapon X. Calvin then regained his memories and the real Wolverine arranged for Calvin to spend some time in Japan to help learn to control his powers.\nYears later in Siberia, X-Force found him and tried to calm him down after they crashed into a station nearby. Sometime later Mimic formed an alliance with Onslaught, who upgraded his powers in exchange for his services. He also allied himself with a man known as Sledge who also upgraded his powers.Sometime later Excalibur was searching for Xavier after the Operation: Zero Tolerance fiasco and instead found Mimic being held hostage by rogue Sentinels. Confused he attacked the members of Excalibur and ultimately lost. They then took him to their headquarters where he recuperated and attended the wedding of Captain Britain and Meggan.Weeks later he for some unknown reason joined the new Brotherhood Of Mutants and helped the X-Men defeat Cerebro. He then continued to work with the Brotherhood when they tried to capture X-51 a.k.a. Machine Man. They failed and Calvin was captured. Later while being held prisoner Valerie Cooper came and consoled him and offered him a way out of prison, which he took. He was then alongside the Brotherhood affected by a beam sent down by the High Evolutionary in order to de-power all of Earths mutants. The beam caused Calvin to lose his powers momentarily, but he quickly regained them moments after the beam was reversed.Later Calvin spent an unknown amount of time on Muir Island with Dr. Moira MacTaggert in hopes of finding peace. It was here that Moira figured out that Calvin had Bipolar Disorder. Under her care Calvin began to take mood stabilizers and anti-anxiety medication. Calvin was seen as a captive of the Thunderbolts after Civil War|recent developments as a captive alongside hundreds of other criminals in the Folding Castle Detention Quadrant. It is unknown if Calvin joined the Thunderbolts or if was simply held by them as a prisoner.\nAfter the Secret Invasion by the Skrulls Calvin was in some sort of unidentified incident in which he came into contact with Norman Osborn. During this encounter Norman recruited Calvin into the newest government sponsored incarnation of the X-Men lead by Emma Frost. During an incident in San Francisco, Calvin and his X-Men were called out to quell a riot instigated by the mutants Hellion, Meld, Lorelei Travis, Avalanche, Match, Adam X, and Sunspot. After dispersing the mutant rioters Emma's team of X-Men returned to Alcatraz Island, the west coast headquarters of H.A.M.M.E.R., where Mimic and his fellow X-Men were confronted by Norman Osborn's Avengers. After a small skirmish between Daken and Hawkeye the two teams calmed their more volatile members down. Mimic even threatened Hawkeye with a shiv made out of ice. The two teams then went their respective ways until Simon Trask activated his new \"Bio-Sentinels\" out of his followers at St. Francis Hospital. These Sentinels caused mayhem and panic in downtown San Francisco until Emma's X-Men were called onto the scene. After engaging these Sentinels, Calvin tried to reason with one of the robots but was reprimanded by fellow teammate Weapon Omega. Swiftly taking care of the Sentinels, Calvin and his team apprehended Trask. Calvin and his team continued to patrol the streets and arrest criminals and unruly mutants. Having been celebrated as heroes by the public, Calvin and his X-Men then responded to a distress call on Alcatraz as X-Force and other X-Men freed the tortured mutant prisoners including Beast. As they arrived on the scene Daken confronted his father, but was put down by Emma Frost. Confused by this Calvin tried to talk with Emma, but was knocked out by Namor who slammed Calvin into a wall. Emma, Namor, Cloak, Dagger, and X-Force left Alcatraz via a stepping stone created by Magik. Recovering, Calvin and his teammates Dark Beast, Weapon Omega, Daken, and Osborn's Avengers prepared for an all out battle against Cyclops's X-Men and the remaining mutants of San Francisco. Calvin and his teammates then assaulted the newly created island of Utopia to attack and apprehend the X-Men. Calvin confronted former teammate Iceman who quickly grounded Calvin. Seeing their opportunity the Young X-Men and other young mutants pounced on Mimic, overpowering him. Calvin managed to overpower and escape alongside his teammates. After recovering, Calvin attended a huge news conference set up by Osborn. During the conference Osborn demonized Cyclops and his newly constructed island of Utopia. Osborn also congratulated and praised the efforts of his X-Men, Calvin among them.After the Utopia incident Calvin was put under the psychiatric care of Dr. Karla Sofen due to his depression. During these sessions Calvin will often talk about his depression and his urge to be a good person. Calvin, alongside Norman Osborn's other X-Men, were then gathered for a briefing about the small town of Burton, California coming under psychic attack from a being claiming to be an X-Man. Calvin, along with his teammates, were then sent to Burton to investigate things. There they interviewed a victim of the attack, but suddenly the victim gained mutant powers which were instantly copied by Weapon Omega and Calvin. Omega could not cope with the copied powers and flew off whereas Calvin gained the ability to see into the future. In one of his visions he say himself with his old girlfriend Vera Cantor, apparently they had married, and their child. The vision ends in Calvin's powers going out of control and accidentally killing both Vera and his child. Shaken from this vision, Calvin was unable to help his teammates subdue Omega until Dark Beast sprayed him with some sort of power enhancing, psychoactive rage inducing drug. Due to the drug, Calvin became crazed and started to attack Omega. Somehow shaking off the effects of the drug and the copied powers, Calvin was able to subdue Omega and return to H.A.M.M.E.R. headquarters with his teammates who found out that the psychic entity was none other than Nate Grey, otherwise known as X-Man. With this new knowledge Norman gave them a new mission: capture Nate Grey. The team then went to the Psi-Division of H.A.M.M.E.R. to find Nate. While there they were met by the Psi-Division commander Alex Jarl to help them utilize the psychic division to its fullest potential. Jarl utilized all of his psychics to search for Nate, but Nate used their combined psi-energy to restore his physical form and to catch \"up-to-date\" on the world since he has been gone, including the rise of Norman Osborn. Not too happy with how the world was going, Nate started to attack H.A.M.M.E.R. facilities across the country and coming into contact with Norman's Avengers. Called into action, Calvin and his team joined the fray. During the fight Calvin saved Nate's life from Hawkeye, really Bullseye, in order to copy his powers to find out more about his future. After copying his powers Calvin joined Nate inside the time-stream where they talked about Calvin's vision and the way Nate perceives the world, however Ares, being a god, found them and ended the discussion, and before Nate was knocked unconscious Nate called out for Calvin to be a hero, but it was too late. However, before Nate was taken away, a brilliant flash of light came from Nate and he disappeared, leaving a charred corpse. Nate was alive though and took possession of Norman Osborn. Mystique, being a master of disguise recognized this and warned her teammates as well as the possessed Osborn that she knew. Determined to fix this, Calvin and his team visited the Psi division again and utilizing the psychics and Calvin's psychic powers had himself and teammates transported into the mind of Norman Osborn. While there, Nate led the team to the part of Norman's mind which housed the Green Goblin entity. Accidentally freeing him, the team set out to find the Goblin and Norman. Once the Goblin was found, he sliced Mystique's neck; Calvin was the only person on the team who seemed to care about her being hurt. Healing herself, the team pressed on against the Goblin, however the Goblin trapped Calvin and Omega and used his willpower to gain control of them. The three of them then broke into the area where Nate and Norman were dueling it out for control of Norman's body. The Goblin then used Calvin and Omega to draw out all of Nate's power, leaving him helpless and restoring order to Norman's mind. Ensnared and restrained, Nate told Calvin that if he would have been a hero he could have helped put his premonition into perspective and helped him take control of his life and would have helped Mystique and Omega as well. Nate was then carted off to the Omega Machine while Calvin, Mystique, and Omega were visibly saddened and reflected on what they had done. After Osborn was deposed by Earth's Mightest Heroes there came a great crisis involving the Asgardians. During this time the Initiative called as many heroes to arms as they could in order to control the chaos and the riots that were caused by Sin and The Serpent. Calvin was in this crowd of heroes who answered the call. In what capacity and where he helped remains unknown.Some time later, Calvin and Weapon Omega, Michael Pointer, crash landed at the newly formed Jean Grey School for Higher Learning in seek of help from the local X-Men faction; Weapon Omega's powers had begun to fluctuate out of control essentially making him a human time-bomb. During the time with the X-Men, Calvin showed true remorse for his past misdeeds and creating a special bond with Rogue. During this time Beast was having trouble figuring a way to safely dissipate Omega's energy, until Calvin came up with the idea of Rogue and himself siphoning off the excess energy from Michael Pointer. Through cooperation, Calvin and the other X-Men were able to put Michael in a state of suspended animation until they could figure out a true way to safely expel all the chaotic energy trapped within his body. Calvin, seeking friendship and a way to reconcile with his abilities and past, was offered a teaching position at the school and a place on the team by Rogue; he gladly accepted the offer and began joining the team on adventures which eventually led him into direct conflict with the Avengers.After the conflict between the Avengers and X-Men, Calvin, feeling doubt and unsure of his identity due to the nature of his powers, helped quell a riot at a superhuman prison with Rogue; during the event Calvin learned to reconcile his identity issues and doubts with the help of Rogue while battling a multitude of super powered criminals. Upon returning, Calvin told Rogue that due to Omega's recovery he, and Michael, would be leaving the school to start a new chapter in their lives. Sometime later, Omega and Calvin were helping with relief effort in a disaster area when they were approached by the anonymous X-Man known as ForgetMeNot, whose powers made him forgettable to those around him; seeking their help in order to purge him of his powers they were interrupted by the untimely arrival of Cyclops, Magik, Emma Frost, and Magneto who sought to recruit Weapon Omega and Calvin for their new team. Causing a disruption, and eventual fight, the two teams collided in battle until, with the mixture of Omega, ForgetMeNot, and Calvin's powers they were able to momentarily hide themselves from the X-Men; once they left Calvin and Omega forgot that ForgetMeNot was there as he slinked away in depression.With the ultimate demise of the universe and the formation of Battleworld, his fate and current whereabouts are unknown.",

      "biography": "Calvin Rankin was born into poverty. Fueled by his rage at the world, he found himself hanging out with the wrong crowds. While in a store shoplifting, Calvin came across a young group of students who happened to be the original X-Men. His powers kicked in for the first time and he copied the powers of the nearby mutants. Instead of using these powers for good, Mimic chose another path. Approached by the Brotherhood of Evil, Mimic joined their cause. On his first mission with the team, an attempted kidnapping of Senator Kelly, the X-Men stopped the Brotherhood. Left behind by his teammates, Mimic was captured and jailedWhile he awaited sentencing, Calvin was visited by Professor Charles Xavier and offered a path to redemption. Xavier extended an invitation to join his X-Men. Mimic took the offer. As an X-Man, Mimic became one of the best. The rest of the students were nervous around him at first because of his mimicking powers, but eventually they realized that by sharing their powers he could help them understand themselves better. He eventually became the X-Men’s leader and was an instrumental part of a golden age of peace between mutants and humans. Mimic’s home reality was a place where mutants became celebrities and used their powers for good.Taken from his reality, Mimic became unhinged from time. He was joined by his fellow Exiles and told by the Timebroker they were needed to fix the broken chains of reality. If they didn’t, their own realities would be changed and their lives destroyed. In Mimic’s case, the kidnapping attempt on Senator Kelly went horribly wrong - Kelly and 47 innocent bystanders were killed. Mimic would sit on death row, awaiting execution.On their first mission, the team looked to Mimic for guidance. As leader of the X-Men, he felt prepared for the role. Unfortunately in this reality Professor Xavier had become a revenge-driven homicidal maniac and Mimic was forced to kill him. Devastated by the event, Mimic realized his emotional attachments to his reality would hinder him in leading this team. He turned the reins over to Blink and acted as her second-in-command.This constant contact with one another led to a romance between them. Mimic taught Blink about the different worlds and heroes they might encounter - heroes who were never allowed to surface in Blink’s Age of Apocalypse. They eventually fell in love and constantly looked to each other for support. As the team went on more missions, Calvin began to become more and more embittered towards his situation. He hated the fact that he was constantly forced to fight people he had only known as heroes in his reality. Mimic eventually took this out on Blink and the two separated.Unfortunately, this separation came at an inappropriate time. Blink was almost killed in battle by a techno-organic virus. Mimic realized he still loved Blink but at the end of the mission the Timebroker sent her away and the Tallus was passed to Mimic. With Blink gone, Mimic resumed his role as leader. The toll on him was immense. Following the completion of a mission against a vampire version of the Avengers, the team was hit by a chaos spell, which sent them all spiraling into different realities. Mimic was sent to an Earth conquered by the Brood and spent four years there during which he was implanted with Brood eggs on three different occasions. The healing factor he mimicked from Wolverine, was able to fight off the infection for the most part.   The team was reunited and sent on their next mission. Mimic still had a Brood egg in his system but his healing factor was able to prevent it from taking him over. Unfortunately, in the course of battle with this reality’s enraged Thing, Mimic was beaten severely. With his healing factor in overdrive, Mimic was unable to fight off the infection. The Brood egg took control and Mimic fell under the sway of the Brood Queen within him. He fought his team with all of their abilities. During the conflict, Mimic knocked a building over onto some innocent bystanders. In an effort to save them, Sunfire was crushed by the falling rubble. Mimic continued to fight until an antidote to the Brood infection was given to him. He reverted to normal.Morph found the body of Sunfire and was enraged. He told Mimic that if he knew he was infected and a danger to the team, he should have killed himself. Mimic was devastated by what he had done. At the same moment Blink returned to the team as a replacement for the deceased Sunfire. In the next reality, the Exiles were told they would have to fight their reality-hopping counterparts, Weapon X. Morph was still angry with Mimic for his carelessness and the two walked away from each other. The returned Blink followed Mimic, comforted him and reminded him he had no control while he was under the Brood's influence. In the ensuing battle with the Weapon X team Mimic fought the evil Hyperion. The battle was brutal and Mimic was almost beaten to death before being saved by his teammates. The Exiles survived the conflict and Morph forgave Mimic for what happened to Sunfire, realizing the Brood influence was responsible for his actions.The team moved on, as they always have, and Mimic adopted a new mindset. He confided in Blink that he needed to change his ways. He was becoming too brutal and too quick to use violence to solve the team's situations. His mentor Charles Xavier taught him a different way and he was going to start living it. Mimic decided to make a difference in the realities the team traveled to - he swore to never ever take another life. While it may be difficult for him to change his ways with the tasks the Exiles are given, it appears he will give it a try.After the battle the team realized that Mimic was so badly injured that his healing factor wasn't strong enough to take care of the damage done to his body. Luckily he was mimicking Colossus' form at the time he was injured and could survive in that form indefinitely. Trying to buy Mimic more time while they searched for a cure, Blink had Mimic put into stasis while the team went to a reality known as “Monster World” to retrieve a genetic healing serum from the Dr. Curt Conners of that reality. Blink, Sabretooth, and Morph traveled to this reality and managed to get the serum but only after a lengthy scuffle with Fin Fang Foom. Meanwhile Heather Hudson had enlisted the help of an alternate Stephen Strange to help determine a cure for the injured Mimic. Doctor Strange noticed that the former Weapon X operative Deadpool, who was being held in stasis, had just recently registered as living again. Freeing him out of curiosity and a sense of goodwill, Deadpool almost immediately killed the good doctor and had one of the Timebreakers free the Weapon X She-Hulk. Beak had the Timebreakers free Mimic as well, and he then mimicked Deadpool's healing factor and with the help of She-Hulk defeated Deadpool. The downside was that Mimic was left horribly disfigured due to the nature of Deadpool' healing factor.Seeking to return Beak to his home reality the Exiles again arrived on Earth-616 only to find it had been altered into the House of M reality. Beak, desperately searching for his girlfriend Angel, inadvertently entangled the Exiles into a confrontation with the reality-warping Proteus. After several scuffles Proteus took over the body of Mimic and fled to the New Universe reality. The Exiles followed and left Beak behind. Shortly after the Exiles left, Beak and Angel were changed into humans due to an insane Scarlet Witch attempting to get vengeance on Magneto and Quicksilver.Following Proteus the Exiles encountered Starbrand, D.P.7, and Nightmask. Proteus left Mimic’s body, which he had burnt out. He was then placed inside the wall of Exile casualties in the Crystal Palace. Mimic was then taken back to his own Earth by Blink and was given a proper burial.But maby he might return.",

      "biography": "A Stretch to Survive\n\nGenius Reed Richards impressed his parents with inventions that made them wealthy, but lost his mother at a very young age. At fourteen, he began to collect doctorates at multiple colleges and dreamed of designing and building a starship, a project pilot Ben Grimm promised to help him fulfill. Richards earned the eternal wrath of fellow student Victor von Doom and the love of his landlady’s niece Sue Storm while at State University and after graduation worked for the U.S. military overseas, which put him in the perfect position to see his dream come true.\n\nWhen the government cut Richards’ funding to the starship, the restless genius gathered Grimm, Sue Storm, and her brother Johnny for an illicit test flight of the craft. Unfortunately, he failed to figure for proper shielding to repel cosmic rays while in space and the four found themselves bombarded by the unique radiation. The ship crash-landed back on Earth, and Richards and the others discovered they’d been mutated by the rays, each of them gaining special abilities. Realizing they could use their powers for the benefit of mankind, Richards founded the Fantastic Four.\n \n\nFantastic Form\n\nAltered by cosmic rays, Reed Richards’s entire body can stretch and expand in multiple ways, as well as condense and compact. He may form various shapes with it, as well as become ultra-thin and ultra-dense, the latter helping him to use his fists, for example, as battering rams and the like. On some occasions, Richards has contained explosive material with his body by stretching himself around it and even altered his features to disguise himself as a different person. All of these features of his abilities create stress on his body and the greater the lengths he stretches to, the more it takes its toll.\n\nRichards also stands as one of the world’s highest intellects, if not the highest. He’s adept in nearly all scientific fields known to mankind, as well as certain extraterrestrial disciplines. His specialties of study and actual work lay in such fields as robotics, aviation, and quantum physics, and he holds thousands of patents for his inventions and discoveries. Perhaps one of his greatest achievements, so-called “unstable molecules,” aids the Fantastic Four in particular through the uniforms that allow each team member to utilize their specialized abilities.\n&nbsp;\n\nFantastic Family\n\nThough often times seen as cold and aloof, Reed Richards prizes family above all else and formed the Fantastic Four into one of the greatest examples of a working family unit ever.\n\nSue Storm Richards represents his touchstone, a partner in all things and the love of life. The couple has seen many hard times through the course of their marriage, but they always return to what’s most important: their children, their teammates, and their mission. While deep in a project, Richards sometimes forgets the simple, daily things, but Sue realizes and acknowledges how his mind works and makes concessions to keep their family together and strong.\n\nBen Grimm stands as Richards’ oldest and best friend, though the genius often reflects upon his responsibility in Grimm’s mutation into the monster known as the Thing. The two possess vastly different personalities and backgrounds, but like Sue, Grimm knows how his friend’s mind works and offsets it with always having his back. Richard’s relationship with his brother-in-law Johnny Storm as sometimes been heated, owing to Storm’s fiery disposition, but the bond between the two is strengthened by their connections to Sue and the Richards’ children. All together, the Fantastic Four live and fight as a family, more so than any other heroic team on the planet.\n\nReed Richards loves his two children Franklin and Valeria without measure, but often stands back in awe and wonder at their own abilities. Par for the course with the Fantastic Four, he doesn’t always conduct himself as a typical father to the two, but they love and respect him all the same.\n\nRespect for Mr. Fantastic throughout the heroic community is strong, particularly among those who’ve worked closely with him. Richards’ intellect makes him a good partner for other inventive geniuses such as Tony Stark, Bruce Banner, and T’Challa of Wakanda. \n&nbsp;\n\nFantastic Foes\n\nThe be-all and end-all of enmity for Reed Richards exists in the form of Victor von Doom, Latverian tyrant and super villain. Doom’s hatred of Richards stems from an incident while the two attended college together, a disastrous experiment of Doom’s to contact the spirit world through technology which literally blew up in his face, scarring him. The young man blamed Richards for his own failure and still carries that loathing to this day. Over the years, Mr. Fantastic and Doctor Doom’s battles have become legendary, two intellects constantly at war, though most often instigated by Doom and his shattered pride.\n\nThough the Fantastic Four’s fought many a foe as a team, a few individuals hold a special dislike for Reed Richards himself. These include the Wizard, the Mole Man, and most especially Namor the Sub-Mariner. Namor’s longtime love for Sue Richards exists as a bone of contention between the sea king and the Fantastic Four’s leader, one that appears from time to time as a reminder of their shared history. Sue, never seeing herself as a damsel to be fought over, has tried many times to bring the two together to bury the hatchet, but too often to only a temporary truce.\n&nbsp;",

      "biography": "Growing up in Queens, the oldest child of three, Reed Richards was brighter than those around him. Reed's friend, Ben Grimm, protected him from bullying by lesser classmates, but Reed's father couldn't deal with his son's genius and treated his children harshly, leaving Reed and his sisters infelicitous. While still a child, Reed discovered another dimension and built an oscillator which allowed him to view it. Six months later, in fifth grade, at the Midtown Middle School science fair, Reed demonstrated his ability to send items to that dimension. This caught the eye of Lieutenant Lumpkin, a \"scout\" for the Director of Mainland Technology Development who scoured the world for exceptional children.Reed was placed under supervision of internationally renowned scientist Dr. William Storm at the Baxter Building, a midtown Manhattan government facility for gifted children. Reed's father was relieved to be rid of him, so Reed rarely saw his family thereafter. His only close contacts were fellow students and his dog Einstein. Missing his family, Reed covertly constructed a \"Fantasti-Car,\" a fuel-free vehicle with the capacity to fly at MACH-7, but never used it. Reed studied the N-Zone, but never completely cracked its problems until fellow genius Victor Van Damme adjusted Reed's calculations; over the next five years Damme would help Reed with his N-Zone teleporter while Reed aided Victor's work in miniaturized robots. When Reed built a life-sized N-Zone teleporter, Van Damme surreptitiously made some last minute alterations in superposition calculations, and the activation of the gate created a phase-state fugue which altered Reed and his friends forever, granting them superhuman abilities.Unable to convince Van Damme to help him reverse the changes, Reed returned his focus to science, perfecting his transporter and adapting it to both time travel and accessing parallel dimensions. After the team went public battling the alien Nihil in Las Vegas, Reed began craving the public approval of being a super-hero, perhaps compensating for his father's disapproval. He now balances his obsessive love of science against his relationship with Susan Storm and his new celebrity status.Recently, he tried to ask Sue to mary him, but the ultimatum wave hit and everything got thrown to chios, and the result was he quit the F.F and moved in with his parents. Recently, an unknown person apeared at his front steps of his house, and the person blew up the house with his family in it. Reed Richards is presumed dead.",

      "biography": "Lawrence Cranston, a law school classmate of Matthew Murdock (Daredevil), hated Murdock ever since he was defeated by him in a mock trial as an underclassman. Cranston, who suspected that Murdock was secretly Daredevil, once overheard Daredevil's enemy, Samuel \"Starr\" Saxon force the original Mister Fear, Zoltan Drago, to reveal the location of his costume and gun. Once he had the information, Saxon shot Drago in cold blood. Saxon assumed the Mister Fear identity until he was defeated by Daredevil, apparently killed. Cranston masqueraded as a relative of Saxon and obtained a court order allowing him custody of the Mister Fear costume and equipment. When both Murdock and Daredevil had moved to San Francisco, Cranston believed his suspicious had been confirmed. As a partner in the law firm of Broderick, Sloan, and Cranston, Lawrence convinced his partners to hire Murdock as an associate. Cranston used the job to get close to Murdock so he could ambush him. However, Daredevil recognized the scent of the fear gas, enabling him to avoid its effects. Daredevil unmasked Cranston as Mister Fear; Cranston leapt off the building to escape. However, Cranston had left behind his jets and fell to his apparent death.Upon what appeared to be Cranston's demise, the Mister Fear outfit came into the possession of Cranston's nephew, Alan Fagan, a wealthy businessman. Cranston had somehow survived his fall, and later was secretly living as a professor at Columbia University Law School under the assumed name Harold Cranstone. There he used his fear gas to take vengeance on the faculty members who had overlooked him as a student. As Mister Fear, he kidnapped Daily Bugle reporter Ben Urich and held him alongside the kidnapped faculty members in order to draw Daredevil into a trap. Daredevil defeated Mister Fear, and freed his hostages, but Cranston escaped capture, and returned to Columbia to teach as Cranstone.Cranston secretly continued to plot against Daredevil, sending agents such the manic woman Insomnia and the mentally controlled Molten Man against him. Mister Fear then led Murdock to Ryker's Island where Fear initiated a violent revolt, and then sent a new Gladiator against him. Another of Mister Fear's pawns, Victor Grazia, rebelled against Fear, and used a fire hose against the Gladiator enabling Daredevil to gain the upper hand. Meanwhile, Mister Fear escaped capture, breaking out the psychopathic criminal, Charles Boroughs.Under Cranston's guidance, Boroughs went on a killing spree, eventually stalking Murdock's legal secretary, Karen Page, until she was forced to kill him in self-defense. Cranston arranged for Page to he framed for Borough's murder, but Murdock got the charges against Karen dropped when Daredevil linked Mister Fear to the crime. Escaping capture yet again, Cranston still lives his secret life as a professor, waiting for the right time to strike again. He has also been seen frequently at the Bar with No Name.Recently Cranston has explored other scents beyond just fear. He empowered Lily Lucca, (who was employed by Vanessa Fisk) with a \"Memory Scent\" that reminds men of their greatest love. For Daredevil, the smell reminded him of Karen Page. Lucca later sought Murdock's help to remove the scent. Mister Fear employed Turk Barrett and the Enforcers to distribute street drugs and then lured Daredevil into a trap where he exposed him to a new drug causing hallucinations. After Daredevil escaped the hallucinations, Cranston was confronted by the Hood, and Cranston explained that he had started a war with the Hood for the single reason of getting at Daredevil. After being defeated by Daredevil in combat, Cranston confesses to drugging Melvin Potter and Daredevil's wife Milla. However, Cranston does not care about going to prison, because  the \"Memory Scent\" he used on Lily Lucca was now on himself, and he could persuade anyone in the prison to do whatever he wanted.",

      "biography": "A brilliant but amoral medical research scientist, Calvin Zabo was always oddly intrigued by the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson. Believing the fictional account to be true, Zabo longed for the ability to unleash the bestial side of himself, and he dedicated his life to finding a chemical formula to enable him to do so. The research was incredibly expensive, so Zabo systematically robbed his various employers, avoiding criminal prosecution by simply changing employers before he could be caught. However, his reputation caught up with him. Zabo applied for work with a noted surgeon, Dr. Donald Blake, the secret identity of Thor, but was refused employment based on his past misdeeds. Zabo became furious and vowed vengeance upon the lame doctor. When he struck upon the formula several months later, Zabo transformed himself into Mister Hyde. He immediately sought revenge on Dr. Blake, but was defeated by Thor. Hyde first joined with Cobra to gain revenge on Thor, but despite their defeat, they began a long partnership together. The next teamed together on behalf of Thor’s archenemy, Loki. On his urging, the two kidnapped Blake’s nurse and love interest, Jane Foster but were again defeated by Thor. The pair crossed the paths of many heroes, most notably Daredevil and Spider-Man. Hyde only parted company once, teaming with the Scorpion against Captain America and the Falcon. After yet another defeat from Daredevil landed the pair in Ryker’s Island prison, the Cobra used his powers to escape, willingly leaving Hyde behind. Enraged, Hyde swore vengeance on his former partner.  He later was seen in the employ of Batroc the Leaper.  They succeeded in hijacking a Roxxon Oil supertanker and capturing Captain America, whom they chained to the prow of the ship. The tanker was filled with 50,000 tons of liquefied natural gas. As it cruised through the harbor, Batroc and Hyde set it on a collision coarse with the docks of New York City. The resulting explosion would likely lead to the total destruction of the entire metropolis. Batroc only wanted a huge ransom for the ship and Captain America. Hyde, however, wanted to go through with the plan and cared nothing for the money: he simply wanted Cap and the rest of New York City's population (particularly Cobra) dead. When Batroc realized this, he secretly loosened the chains holding Captain America, who freed himself and dove into the harbor. As Hyde was busy steering the ship, Batroc attacked him from behind. The former partners began a fight to the death. As Hyde began to squeeze the life out of Batroc, Captain America boarded the ship and attacked Hyde. During the fight, Hyde broke a pipe and was hit by a high-pressure stream of liquefied gas. Covered by a thick coating of the freezing liquid, Hyde fell over the side and sank in the harbor. Captain America tried to find him, but Hyde was gone. Cap caught Batroc, who tried to escape during the confusion, and returned the supertanker to Roxxon officials.He returned again to stalk the Cobra, who was at this time seriously fearing for his life. Hyde was stopped by Spider-Man, after a long and ferocious battle, by getting knocked out a high window, plummeting to the street below. The indomitable Mister Hyde was not killed, but merely stunned. He and the Cobra were then easily captured and taken into police custody. Another similar rampage was stopped yet again by Spider-Man with the help of the Black Cat. Baron Zemo later recruited Mister Hyde for his Masters of Evil. While the Avengers were away, Zemo led the Masters of Evil in a successful take-over of the Avengers' Mansion and captured Jarvis, the butler. Zemo, in particular, was used to savagely beat Hercules into a coma. Zemo also turned the hostages (Jarvis, the Black Knight, and Captain America) over to the cruel hands of Mister Hyde, who started beating the butler to death. Hyde was having great fun, until the Black Knight managed to free himself and Cap, fighting Hyde until the rest of the Avengers arrived and brought the Masters of Evil down.In the meantime, Cobra had become the leader of the Serpent Society. As part of re-inventing himself for this new position, Cobra sought out the one person that he still feared above all-- Mister Hyde. After going one-on-one with his former partner, Cobra succeeded in besting him. Flushed with new confidence, he renamed himself King Cobra, and the long grudge match between the two seemed to be over. When Mister Hyde ran afoul of the monstrous Hulk, he received a head wound and Calvin Zabo found himself unable to transform into Hyde. Zabo made his way to a Manhattan bar, where he happened to insult a waitress. The huge leader of a biker gang saw the incident, and he threw Zabo out of the bar. Determined to have revenge, Zabo reentered the bar and hit the biker over the head with a bottle. This time Zabo threw himself out the window in an attempt to escape the enraged bikers. Zabo fled to a nearby parking garage and hid. Meanwhile, Dan Ketch (then, Ghost Rider) arrived at the garage. Zabo was able to become Mister Hyde once more, but Ghost Rider was on hand to save the bikers and innocent bystanders from his rampage. As the police arrived, both Hyde and the Ghost Rider vowed revenge, going their separate ways.At some point earning the enmity of the criminal Eel, Hyde unknowingly found himself a target of revenge. Hyde had befriended a young runaway, Angela Paris, but the Eel secretly murdered her, framing Hyde.  Mister Hyde was given counsel by the lawyer Matt Murdock (a.k.a. Daredevil, whose powers told him Hyde was innocent but whose conscious refused to allow the villain to be convicted of something he didn’t do. As Daredevil investigated, he uncovered the Eel’s involvement and managed to take the Eel into court to clear Hyde’s name. Hyde was released, but Daredevil confronted him and warned him that he would be forever watched by the vigilant hero.More recently, Hyde was seen among those imprisoned at Ryker’s Island. He was used as an informant by Toxin’s alter-ego, Pat Mulligan, who was tracking his old partner, Cobra.",

Guy was raised in foster care after his parents died in a mysterious fire. Guy underwent extensive martials arts training and mental disciplines to try and block out the pain. Professor X was able to provide Guy with a special sensory-dampening suit. However, he remained depressed and kept a gun to play 'Russian Roulette' with. He was recruited into X-Force, and surprisingly was quickly made the leader after the Boys R Us disaster. He resented the name of Mister Sensitive, and preferred to call himself the Orphan. Coach began to urge the others into making Guy doubt himself after Guy refused to let a young mutant named Paco Perez be dissected for study. Coach even dug up information on his parents' deaths, insinuating that Guy was responsible for the fire. Coach ordered U-Go Girl to load Guy's gun after distracting him. Guy was easily able to tell the difference due to his senses. He and Wolverine were able to kill Smoke and Succubus, and Edie ended up shooting Coach. Guy was forced into making the team lose to pay back money the CIA lost on Paco. On their next mission Edie was shot by the Bush Rangers, causing Guy to become even more depressed. Venus Dee Milo was selected to replace her, but Guy initially rejected her. After hearing her own tragic tale, he accepted her, and the two became lovers. Guy had problems both with the Bad Guy posing as him, and with the Mysterious Fanboy joining the team seeking revenge for the death of U-Go Girl. Guy stepped down as leader with his good friend Anarchist taking his place. On their last mission, which they thought would give them enough money to retire comfortably, the team was ambushed. Guy had 'a funny feeling' about the mission. Tike and Guy survived the initial attack, then ran in for one last blaze of glory. They are presumed dead.",

Sinister agreed to help them, as long as he could have a DNA sample from Courier. This DNA sample allowed Sinister to replicate Courier shape shifting abilities, within Sinister’s own body.By the early 20th Century, Sinister had cracked the genetic genome and was willing to share the information with Herbert Edgar Wyndham, who would later become the High Evolutionary.During World War II, Sinister worked alongside the Nazis, collecting as many blood samples as he could. It was during this time that he first saw Sub-Mariner, and was inspired to create a clone of Namor. The clone was experiment N2 and had varied success against the original Namor but was defeated by Captain America.Some time later, Sinister recruited Gambit to gather together the Marauders and ordered the massacre of the Morlocks. Sinister cloned Jean Grey in the form of Madelyne Pryor, so that Cyclops would have a child with her, which Sinister would view as the ultimate mutant. Ultimately, Cyclops rejected Pryor when Jean returned from stasis, and the youth would be carried to the future, where he would return to present era as Cable. Sinister's machinations would lead to the event known as Inferno, where Cyclops supposedly killed Sinister with an optic blast, although Sinister resurfaced alive and well, when he revealed that there was a third Summers brother.Sinister was involved in Stryfe's attempted assassination of Xavier,, trading Cyclops &amp; Jean Grey to Stryfe in exchange for their DNA. However, Stryfe actually gave Sinister the Legacy Virus, which would terrorize mutant (and eventually human) life, and lead to the deaths of several mutants.Sinister later involved himself with Nate Grey and the mutant Threnody. He joined the reestablished Weapon X program as Doctor Robert Windsor, claiming to help mutants escape Weapon X's mutant concentration camp \"Neverland,\" but in reality, he took them to be his test subjects.",

      "biography": "Mojo rules over the planet Mojo World in the dimension dubbed the Mojoverse, both so named by himself and his tyrannical ego. He is a member of the race of Spineless Ones, beings whose evolution was stunted by their lack of spines until the scientist Arize created exoskeletons and other mechanical devices that could help them move. (Mojo himself uses various mechanical platforms, some outfitted with hover jets and others with spider-like appendages.)  This technological development allowed the Spineless Ones to rapidly advance their civilization until its basic technology surpassed Earth’s own. Unfortunately, the society developed around its obsession with television, due in part from the Spineless One’s low attention span, and its political structure became based on television programs and the resultant media ratings. Mojo rose to power due to his control over the television industry and his popular programming choices, the most notable of which were televised exploits of the X-Men from Earth-616.  Another facet of the Mojoverse society was its reliance upon slavery, which Mojo had also profited from immensely. Arize had genetically engineered a race of beings with spines to become slaves for the Spineless Ones, basing their construction on mythic images of devils, which look like Earth human beings. Two slaves in particular that Mojo supervised the creation of were Spiral and Quark, whose head resembled a ram. Secretly, however, Arize genetically programmed all slaves to feel the desire to rebel against the Spineless Ones and seek a just rule. This dispensation finally reared its head in Longshot, a slave who had previously enjoyed great popularity as a stuntman in Mojo’s programs. Longshot began to grow so dissatisfied with the Spineless Ones that he formed a rebellion, only to be forced to escape the Mojoverse and arrive on Earth with Mojo and bounty hunters in pursuit. He was found by Ricochet Rita, a stuntwoman, and together with Dr. Strange, the threesome defeated Mojo and forced him to return to his home dimension. Longshot and Rita soon followed, hoping to continue the rebellion.At some point, Mojo captured Besty Braddock, Psylocke, who had been blinded by Slaymaster. Mojo offered her cybernetic eyes, which she accepted, and she was rescued by the original New Mutants and returned to Earth, not knowing that Mojo could use her new eyes as cameras to record the adventures of the X-Men.    Having captured Longshot and erasing his memories, Mojo transported him to Earth so that he could encounter the X-Men, which in turn led to their capture. The New Mutants freed the X-Men, who returned to Earth with Longshot. Despite Mojo’s apparent failure, the broadcast of this adventure earned high ratings, increasing Mojo’s political clout.When the X-Men were believed dead after a battle with the Adversary, Mojo stopped receiving signals from Psylocke’s cybernetic eyes. Around the same time, Mojo captured Phoenix (Rachel Summers), but she escaped his dimension and defeated his agents, the Warwolves, with the help of the heroes that became Excalibur. Faced with the possibility of never being able to televise the X-Men’s adventures, Mojo decided to create his own version of the X-Men, one that could be under his supervision and control. He finally approved of the X-Babies, and the group earned great ratings until they finally hoped to opt out of their contracts, rebelling against Mojo with the help of Ricochet Rita. When Mojo captured Longshot again, he earned his highest ratings to that point when he also took captive the X-Men and placed them all in roles such as the Scarecrow (Cyclops), the Tin Woodman (Rogue), and the Cowardly Lion (Wolverine) for The Wizard of X. Dazzler was also transported to Mojo World, but she was kidnapped by an upstart clone, Mojo II, who used Dazzler and other spined slaves the rebellion. When the final ratings came in, Mojo II triumphed, replacing his predecessor. His rule didn’t last too long, however, for when the X-Babies tried to escape the Mojoverse, the original Mojo was seen in charge once again. (The X-Babies had escaped and stumbled into Shadowcat, and she helped them turn the tables on the Agent. She helped the X-Babies return home, but only so that they could renegotiate their contracts to the chagrin of Mojo.)Creating even more X-Babies, Mojo found even more rebellion. His latest version included baby analogues of all X-Men at that point, but they all escaped. Mojo then created baby versions of the Avengers in the Mitey ‘Vengers, but they, too, would turn on their creator, eventually siding with the X-Babies. Perhaps learning his lesson, Mojo turned to creating baby versions of popular X-Men villains, but this turned out to be a mistake. Mojo World was reportedly destroyed by the baby versions of the villains Apocalypse, Holocaust, Dark Beast, and the Sugar Man.More recently, however, the dimension-hopping Exiles were stranded in the Mojoverse-- trapped by Mojo, who hoped to keep Morph as an exclusive star. The Mojo World loved Morph’s escapades, and the merchandise alone helped drive Mojo’s profits. Morph’s teammates escaped to find Longshot, who helped them turn the tables on Mojo. Morph nearly killed Mojo in the final confrontation but was stopped by the Timebroker, who argued that continuing with such action would irreparably damage the timestream. The Exiles later contacted Mojo once again, as their leader Heather Hudson hoped to bargain with Mojo to release Longshot so that he could join the team. As an exchange, she offered access to the video feeds of the Exiles’ headquarters, effectively allowing him to view all realities of the multiverse, to which Mojo agreed. Treacherous to the end, Mojo wiped Longshot’s mind clean before releasing him, although he nevertheless helped the Exiles defeat Proteus.",

      "biography": "The Molecule Man started out as a lowly laboratory technician who worked at the Acme Atomic Corp.  But one day, while Owen Reece was bemoaning his position in life as a nobody, a cog in the wheels of the corporation, he became distracted enough to make a mistake that would forever change his life.  The atomic machine he worked on blasted him with radiation, and he survived, but the accident gave him power over the very building blocks of existence.  Without even knowing his name, the head of the corporation fired him, but Owen used his new found powers to freeze him solid, using a wand that he believed he needed to focus his powers.Reece then took control of the Fantastic Four’s Baxter Building, and tore it from the ground, hovering along with it over Times Square.  He announced that he was taking over the city and would become the only law.  Even the Fantastic Four, who were asked to stop him by Uatu The Watcher, were unable to beat him, and were forced to flee in order to come up with a new plan.  But Mister Fantastic soon discovered that Reece could seemingly not control organic material and enlisted the help of Alicia Masters, the Thing’s girlfriend, to cover the four in plaster and pass them off as statues.  Reece came after them and tried to manipulate the statues, but the feedback from trying to affect their organic molecules caused him intense pain.  Uatu then appeared and trapped him within another dimension to protect Earth from his power.To pass the time, Owen created a companion, using his powers to fashion a fully-conscious being that he called his son.  However, Owen found that time passed at an accelerated rate in his new world and soon died of old age.  Owen’s “son” took up the Molecule Man’s wand and found it contained all his power.  Calling himself the new Molecule Man, the being used the wand to escape back to Earth, hoping to avenge his father.  He sought out the Thing of the Fantastic Four, battling him until the Thing managed to separate him from the wand.  Apparently, the wand was necessary to maintain his existence, and the new Molecule Man disintegrated.\n \nIn fact, Owen Reece had not died, but managed to transfer his consciousness and powers into the wand his \"son\" carried.  He could overpower the minds of whoever touched the wand and take control of their bodies, temporarily reviving the Molecule Man each time.  The wand passed through the hands of a succession of holders until the Silver Surfer happened upon it, sensing its great power.  When he casually dismissed it, however, Reece's mind finally proved able to recreate his body, power and all.  His encounter with the Surfer convinced Owen that he had always failed because he had no purpose beyond petty tantrums.  Inspired by the Surfer’s tale, Owen decided he would devour the Earth similar to Galactus.  The Surfer sent for help, and the Avengers arrived to confront him.  The Avengers were easily defeated, as the Molecule Man disintegrated Captain America’s shield, Iron Man’s armor, Thor’s hammer, and even the Silver Surfer’s surfboard.  Ultimately, it was Tigra who managed to talk him down, giving Owen the first heart-to-heart he had heard in years and convincing him to give himself up and seek psychiatric help.Owen Reece did so, and soon began seek out more conventional goals: true love, friendship, and a good home.  Instead, however, the Molecule Man was abducted to Battleworld, the planet created by the Beyonder (now, the Maker), as part of the small army of criminal superhuman beings that were to engage in the first of the Secret Wars.  He only joined the other supervillains after some persuasive words by Doctor Doom, and fought the assembled superheroes who were also brought to Battleworld.  During the course of the war, Owen and Volcana fell in love.  When Doom succeeded in stealing the power of the Beyonder for himself, Owen thought Doom had abandoned them all and confronted Doom, threatening to kill him.  But Doom helped Reece realize his powers were only limited by his own sense of unworthiness--his power was greater than he had believed and could even effect organic materials.  No longer angry at Doom (who eventually lost his new power), Owen used his powers to transport himself, Volcana, and most of the criminals, along with the entire portion of the city of Denver, back to Earth. On Earth, Owen and Volcana began a quiet life living together, and Owen took a new job as a worker in an atomic plant.  This bliss was not to last, as the Beyonder returned to Earth to seek emotional fulfillment but failed, declaring he would destroy the multiverse.  Owen was sought out by the assembled heroes, and he tried to destroy the Beyonder, but the Beyonder's immense power far surpassed even Owen’s own, and Owen was left exhausted.  Finally, the Beyonder unleashed an immensely powerful blast of energy to destroy Owen and his allies, sufficient even to rip open Earth's crust and threaten incredible planetwide instability.  The Molecule Man used his power to shield himself and his allies and remove every living thing from the path of the blast to safety, but the cost of doing so seemed to severely injure him internally.The Beyonder then created a complex machine to transform himself into a mortal being with his full power.  The Molecule Man and his allies found the machine, and Owen, but they could not take the chance that the newly reborn Beyonder would not someday destroy the multiverse, and decided to kill him while he was incubating.  Owen wrecked the machine, causing the infant's death, and diverted the Beyonder's immense power, released by the machine, into the dimension from which the Beyonder had originally come.  The injured Molecule Man and the Silver Surfer, uniting their power temporarily, repaired all the damage done to the Earth.  Owen then claimed his powers had been burned out, so as to once more hide away from the heroes.  He returned to live quietly with Volcana in their Denver suburb.  Among his allies, only Volcana and the Silver Surfer knew that Owen still had his powers.Months later, Owen was confronted by Kubik, a being created from the Cosmic Cube.  Kubik revealed to Owen that his powers stemmed from similar energies, as did the Beyonder, who Kubik also confronted and nearly destroyed most of the Beyonder's pet reality.  Kubik might have destroyed the Beyonder, but the alien Shaper of Worlds called him to stop the battle.  Under the Shaper's guidance, Kubik, Molecule Man, and the Beyonder realized they shared a common origin, and the Molecule Man and Beyonder physically merged to create a new Cosmic Cube-- their powers were actually an intelligence like Kubik's that was split during the Molecule Man's origin.  Owen was mutated into the Molecule Man while the remaining energy developed sentience to become the Beyonder.  Kubik left with the Shaper into space to oversee the development of this new Cube, which might someday hatch a being similar to Kubik. Volcana, who believed Owen to be dead after merging into the Cube, was actually secretly imbued by Owen with his power moments before the transformation.  She tried going through life as normal, but soon found herself exhibiting strange new aspects of her powers, due to the power of the Molecule Man within her.Eventually, the Cube separated Owen’s essence from his power, rejected him and returned him to Earth, powerless.  Volcana soon stumbled upon Owen, who was living in squalor at his old apartment.  He knew he was powerless and felt it better to live in anonymity than to have nothing to offer his true love.  Before they could make up, the criminal organization A.I.M., which had been tracking Volcana due to her power fluctuations, attacked the two through their agent Klaw.  Reece's powers, within her, evolved to allow her to wish his powers returned to him.  Now once again the Molecule Man, Owen quickly defeated Klaw, but Volcana would not return to him, seeing him as a bully and too dependant on his power to attempt to try a relationship.  Owen left her, still professing his love and vowing to prove it to her someday.",

      "biography": "Former lab assistant to Spencer Smythe, Mark Raxton helped to develop an experimental metallic alloy obtained from a meteor containing organic matter. During an argument between the two, the metallic alloy spilled over Raxton’s body and was absorbed into his skin. Fearing for his life, he ran for the nearest hospital, only to discover that the alloy had granted him extraordinary powers. Realizing the potential his new abilities gave him, Raxton, now calling himself the Molten Man turned to crime to further his gains. Peter Parker, as Spider-Man, was forced to nearly miss his high-school graduation to stop the Molten Man's first crime spree.After graduating high school, Elizabeth Allan worked as a nurse to aid Raxton, her step-brother. It was only after Molten Man made an attempt to attack her, he realized that his step-sister was the only member of his family who had not abandoned him. After desperate attempts to cure himself involving criminal activities, Raxton ended up in the Vault, the superhuman prison in the Colorado Rockies.Years later, reconciling with Raxton, Liz and her husband Harry Osborn gave Raxton a job as head of security at Osborn Industries. Raxton supported Liz when Harry went back his villainous ways and later helped Spider-Man to capture him. Molten Man and Spider-Man have since become friends, but when Ben Reilly assumed the role of Spider-Man they have minor disagreement until they allied themselves against Gaunt.Raxton also crossed paths with Daredevil when he was affected by a gas made by Mister Fear. Daredevil managed to dispose the gas before he managed to hurt anyone and revealed that Raxton was betrayed by one of his own people. Some time after that, Molten Man was abducted by Norman Osborn, the original Green Goblin, and was brainwashed. Under mind control, Molten Man attacked and killed Osborn's henchwoman Alison Mongrain, who happened to be one of the few people who knew the true cause Mary Jane's miscarriage. While Molten Man has since recovered from the mind control, he still bears a heavy burden of guilt over the incident.Sometime after Civil War|Superhero Registration Act came a law and Spider-Man had publicly revealed his identity. Chameleon recruited Scarecrow, Will-O'-The-Wisp, Electro and Swarm to the group he himself called Exterminators. He then blackmailed Raxton to join the group by threatening to hurt a child who he was mentoring. They made Liz call Spider-Man to come her apartment by threatening to hurt Normie. When Spider-Man arrived with Black Cat they were attacked by Raxton, Will-O'-The-Wisp and Scarecrow. Spider-Man and Black Cat managed to beat them and Spider-Man made Raxton tell them where Chameleon was. He told that Chameleon was after Aunt May. Raxton apparently was arrested shortly after Spider-Man and Black Cat left to rescue Aunt May.",

      "biography": "Monica Rambeau has always been devoted to serving and protecting the public, both as herself and in her various costumed guises. Before she became one of the brightest stars in the age of marvels, Monica Rambeau was a dedicated lieutenant in the New Orleans harbor patrol, partnered with the daring John Audain. Monica's life changed when old Rambeau family friend Professor Andre LeClare came to her for help; he had developed an other-dimensional energy-tapping device with financial support from South American dictator Ernesto Ramirez, who intended to use LeClare's technology to create incredibly dangerous weapons. Ramirez had already begun adapting the technology for his own purposes with the aid of scientist Felipe Picaro, but LeClare and Rambeau joined forces to destroy Picaro's prototype. In the process, Rambeau was bombarded by the device's extra-dimensional energies and gained the power to convert her own body into energy and back again at will. LeClare urged her to use this power as a crimefighter, and she left the harbor patrol to become a full-time adventurer.\n\nDubbed Captain Marvel by the media, Rambeau sought out the Avengers for help in mastering her new powers and became a member-in-training of their group. Befriended and mentored by Avengers veterans Captain America and the Wasp, Monica soon graduated to full membership, serving a lengthy stint during which she became one of the team's most valuable and respected members. One early complication was the memory of an earlier Captain Marvel, the legendary alien warrior Mar-Vell, a deceased honorary member of the Avengers. Rambeau felt awkward about inheriting his title after she learned of his existence, but she retained the name since the Avengers and others regarded her as a worthy heir to Mar-Vell's heroic legacy. Another new Avengers recruit, Mar-Vell's close friend Starfox (Eros), disapproved of Monica using the Captain Marvel name at first; but even he was soon impressed by Monica's character and ability, giving her his blessing and saluting the new Captain Marvel.\n\nAs an Avenger, Monica faced foes such as Maximus, the Enclave, Annihilus, the Lava Men (who mistook her for the divine Lady-of-Light of their legends), Morgan Le Fay, the Dire Wraiths, Maelstrom, the Skrulls, Kang, Attuma, Freedom Force, an insane Quicksilver, Tyrak, and Grandmaster's Legion of the Unliving, even battling an army of Earth's major super-criminals during the Beyonder's Secret Wars alongside many of Earth's foremost heroes. Two of Monica's earliest recurring enemies were super-powered psychiatrist Moonstone (Karla Sofen), who became one of Monica's bitterest foes, and Moonstone's powerful pawn Blackout (Marcus Daniels), who wielded the eerie Darkforce. Captain Marvel first encountered them when the Avengers opposed the duo's escape from incarceration in Project: PEGASUS. The pair would later return as members of Baron (Helmut) Zemo's Masters of Evil, participating in an occupation of Avengers Mansion and trapping Monica in the Darkforce dimension; but Captain Marvel escaped in time to help retake the Mansion during a series of skirmishes that left Moonstone temporarily crippled and Blackout dead. Another of Monica's major early foes was the murderous interstellar pirate Nebula, who shanghaied Monica into space for an extended period before she was reunited with the Avengers; but while Monica's adventures spanned space and time, she remained one of the most down-to-Earth Avengers. Her powers allowed her to make frequent visits to her native New Orleans, where she maintained a close and loving relationship with her parents. She even started a charter fishing business, eventually working on the water alongside her father, a retired firefighter and Monica's original heroic inspiration.\n\nWhen an exhausted Wasp stepped down as Avengers chairwoman, Captain America nominated Captain Marvel to replace her as team leader. Though she was overwhelmed at the prospect, Monica accepted the post and filled it quite capably at first, even seeing the team through a conflict with the Olympian gods; however, Monica became increasingly uneasy in her new role, a situation made worse after ambitious new recruit Doctor Druid began undermining her leadership. Finally, when honorary Avengers member Marrina transformed into the gigantic sea monster Leviathan, Captain Marvel led the hunt for the creature; during the battle that followed, Monica made contact with sea water while in her electrical form and accidentally conducted herself across the surface of the ocean, depleting her energies so gravely and dispersing her atoms so widely that she could barely regain physical form, emerging as a frail, withered husk of a woman devoid of super-powers. Forced to retire from the team, Monica fought her way back to health and eventually regained her powers, though in a reduced and altered form that allowed her to surround herself with a manipulable energy field. She resumed crimefighting, facing foes such as Brazilian crimelord Kristina Ramos, Moonstone, Powderkeg, the Sons of the Serpent, the Blue Marvel and the alien Starblasters. At the same time, she served as a cargo ship captain in her friend Ron Morgan's shipping company before starting her own charter business. Her original powers gradually regenerated, fully returning after the alien Stranger helpfully accelerated the process.\n\nMonica has yet to return to the full-time Avengers roster, but has stayed connected with the team and served often as a reservist, sometimes assuming leadership duties in the absence of the current chair. She helped repel an Atlantean invasion, opposed the Acts of Vengeance conspiracy, chaired a reserve substitute roster during the team's first United Nations-backed reorganization, led an Avengers delegation to the Shi'ar empire during the Kree-Shi'ar war, played a key role in overthrowing the alternate reality tyranny of Morgan le Fay (Monica being one of only a few heroes whose sense of Avengers spirit was strong enough to overcome Morgan's mind-warping magic), battled the Wrecking Crew, advised troubled new recruit Triathlon, led an ad hoc squad of Avengers in saving the galaxy from relocation by the Infinites, helped contain Bloodwraith, fought Lord Templar &amp; Pagan, faced the Triple-Evil, helped liberate Earth from the forces of Kang, battled The Order, assisted during the Scorpio crisis, and was one of many Avengers who confronted an insane Scarlet Witch. Rambeau also helped staff the Avengers' deep space monitoring station in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, being one of the few Avengers who could commute there with ease. For a time, Monica's mother was intercepting her Avengers calls since she feared for her daughter's safety and wanted Monica to spend more time with her ailing father, but Monica soon put a stop to her mother's meddling. Whether she will work with the newly reorganized Avengers at some point remains to be seen.\n\nWhen the late Mar-Vell's offspring Genis became an adventurer, he soon became known as Captain Marvel like his father before him-which Monica resented at first. After she and Genis teamed up to defeat the Controller, Genis tried to concede the Captain Marvel title to Monica since he felt she was more worthy of it; but Monica declined out of respect for the Mar-Vell legacy, impulsively adopting a new costumed alias as Photon. More recently, Genis-physically and mentally transformed after a near-death experience and wanting to establish a new identity for himself distinct from his father-started calling himself Photon. Monica confronted him, tensely at first, but the two Photons ended up brainstorming super-hero names over coffee. Neither one of them wanted to become Captain Marvel again given all the baggage associated with the name, but Monica decided to let Genis keep the Photon alias after she came up with a name she liked better: Pulsar. A hero by any name, Monica remains one of the most formidable adventurers of her generation.\n\nRecently Monica has taken up the leadership mantle of the rogue superhero squad Nextwave and played a stellar role in helping Black Panther, Luke Cage, Blade, and Brother Voodoo rid her native New Orleans of an infestation of vampires.",

      "biography": "MOONSTRUCK\n\nBorn to a respectable family, but eschewing its history and beliefs Marc Spector cut his own path through life by becoming a boxer, a Marine, and finally a CIA operative. Disgusted by the organizations practices and hurt by his own brother Randall’s betrayal, Spector ejected whatever morals he still possessed and fell into mercenary work around the globe. During this dark time, he made friends with Jean-Paul “Frenchie” DuChamp, one of the only bright spots in the violent profession of a hired gun.\n\nTiring of overthrowing governments and assassinations, Spector entered into the orbit of an extreme terrorist named Bushman who turned on him and left him to die in the harsh Egyptian desert. Somehow, the mercenary made it to a nearby ancient tomb and into the hands of Marlene Alaurune, the daughter of an archaeologist murdered by Bushman. Near dead, Spector rose up to find a statue of the Egyptian deity Khonshu looming over him and believed it to have saved his life. He proceeded to smash Bushman’s operations with Frenchie’s help and later realized he’d gained a new outlook on life.\n\nSpector returned to the United States with his friends and set about creating not only a costumed identity he dubbed Moon Knight, but two other personalities to aid him in his war on crime, millionaire Steven Grant and cab driver Jake Lockley. With Frenchie as his pilot, Moon Knight began to make an impression on the rest of New York City’s heroes.\n\nMOONSCAPE\n\nMarc Spector’s CIA career and mercenary work added to his boxing skills to endow him with not only strength and endurance, but also with a high degree of tactical and strategic skills, as well as combat and weapons expertise. Beyond boxing, he knows several martial arts, is a talented athlete and gymnast, and can speak several languages. Unfortunately, these abilities are balanced by an uneven mental state that manifests itself in bouts of depression and multiple identity disorder.\n\nOver his years as Moon Knight, Spector has also exhibited periodic demonstrations of supernatural powers such as enhanced strength during nights with full moons, prophetic visions and dreams, and the ability to drain another person’s life energies through physical contact.\n\nMOONFLOWERS\n\nThough Marc Spector’s often-erratic behavior and struggles with multiple identities has caused much friction between him and his associates, he’s managed to form a few close relationships that have stood the test of time.\n\nJean-Paul DuChamp became Spector’s almost-constant companion after they met in Africa, and it was Spector who nicknamed the French-born mercenary “Frenchie.” DuChamp was instrumental in helping Moon Knight in his early days as a costumed champion as the pilot of the Mooncopter and a man-at-arms for Spector’s various missions. Though driven away at times by his friend’s mental issues, Frenchie usually returns to provide support and friendship when Spector needs it the most.\n\nDespite her father’s brutal death and the upturning of her entire life, Marlene Alaurune decided to follow Marc Spector on his path and become not only his lover but a stable base for his occasional unhinged psychological state. Like Frenchie, Marlene has broken her ties with Spector from time to time, but realizes the pressures he endures and returns to see them through with him as a confidant and ally.\n\nMOONEYES\n\nThe enmity in Spector’s life began early with the great chasm that grew between him and his brother Randall. During their time together in the CIA, Randall’s double-dealing with foreign powers exploded into outright war between the brothers, resulting in Randall murdering Spector’s then-girlfriend and receiving a beating so brutal as to psychologically scar him for life. Randall has returned at various times to cause more grief for his brother, mostly as the villainous Shadowknight.\n\nMoon Knight’s other defining opponents include the terrorist Raoul Bushman, the corrupt politician who posed as Black Spectre, and the Egyptian deity Seth. In addition, the deity Khonshu himself stands as a polarizing figure in Spector’s life, providing resurrection and new life, but also perhaps a chief component in Moon Knight’s mental disorders.\n\nMOONSHINES\n\nOne of Moon Knight’s first missions involved infiltrating the mysterious criminal organization called the Committee and accepting their assignment to capture the werewolf Jack Russell. Armed with special silver weapons provided by the group, Spector brought Russell in by force, but later freed him to bring the Committee members to ruin. Following that, Moon Knight aided various heroes such as Spider-Man, the Thing, and the Defenders, and also squared off against his brother Randall again and left believing he’d killed him.\n\nMore missions brought more adversaries for Spector, including rematches with Jack Russell and Bushman, who attempted to take the Khonshu statue Moon Knight brought to New York from Egypt. When the terrorist apparently destroyed the statue, Spector suffered one of his first real mental breakdowns until Marlene revealed she possessed the real one. Spector’s sanity continued to deteriorate through encounters with a villain called Black Spectre and the theft of his father’s corpse by a former student of Elias Spector, and when he debated abandoning all his alternate identities to preserve his mental balance, priests of Khonshu arrived in the city to convince Spector of his status as an avatar of the deity. Now with enhanced strength during full moons, Moon Knight flew off to help the West Coast Avengers on a time-travel mission to ancient Egypt and fell deeper under the power of Khonshu.\n\nThe deity’s overwhelming influence led to Spector accepting Avengers membership against his will, but despite a romantic fling with fellow member Tigra, he left the team over a disagreement with the Avengers’ code against killing. Later, the so-called “Son of Satan” Daimon Hellstrom used his arcane abilities to drive Khonshu from Moon Knight’s body and mind. Returning to New York City, he renewed his relationship with Marlene and met Midnight, a young hero who wanted to become Spector’s partner. After a mission to the country of Bosqueverde with the mercenary Silver Sable, Spector returned to discover Midnight’s adopting of his Moon Knight persona in a battle with the Secret Empire organization. The group transformed the young man into a murderous cyborg, forcing Spector to team up with various heroes to crush them.\n\nStill alive, Randall Spector reappeared as Shadowknight to challenge his brother again, a clash that ended in Moon Knight’s second turn at fratricide. Wanting to start his entire life anew, he created a business called Spectorcorp and adopted new adamantium armor, weapons, and a harder edge to his crimefighting. The Avengers placed Moon Knight on trial for supposedly abusing membership privileges, leading Spector to cut all ties with the team. Soon after, in a fight with the demonic Hellbent and their leader, Moon Knight exhibited the new power to drain others’ lifeforce by simply touching them. Unfortunately, the Hellbent’s computer virus forced Spector to destroy his own headquarters and himself with it to stop the virus’ spread and endangering of lives.\n\nDenied the comfort of the grave, Marc Spector returned to life through the power of Khonshu and with Marlene and Frenchie again at his side he revived his Moon Knight persona to enter into war with Seth, an Egyptian deity in direct opposition of Khonshu. Later, Spector financed operations for a group of heroes who sought the Punisher and together they clashed with villains both low and high. In the end, Spector lost much of his fortune in the deal when the team’s headquarters was destroyed, forcing Moon Knight’s retirement from active crimefighting.\n\nPerhaps sadly for Marc Spector, the costumed life called again, but at the expense of serious bodily injury due to a battle with Bushman. With his legs crippled and his mental state once again unbalanced, he forced Marlene and Frenchie away from him as he struggled with visions of Khonshu assailing him. When a new Committee hired Taskmaster to assassinate Moon Knight, Spector regained the use of his legs to beat them. Now even more violent and prone to maim villains in addition to defeating them, Moon Knight came under the scrutiny of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the then-recently enacted Superhuman Registration Act. Spector accepted registration and a role with the super hero Initiative, but when framed for murder by Black Spectre he lost his license was ordered to retire once more.\n\nNever taking the SHRA seriously, Spector returned to costumed activity almost immediately to hunt down Black Spectre and very publicly kill him. Later, as fugitive from the law, he faked his own death and took up his Jake Lockley identity again, as well as mercenary work. When he later brought Moon Knight back to New York City and completely rejected Khonshu, Captain America invited Spector to join the Secret Avengers.\n\nRandall Spector returned from the afterlife once more to disrupt his brother’s life by beating Marlene to the extent of ending her pregnancy. Moon Knight accepted Khonshu again to gain the power to beat Randall with the mystical Sapphire Crescent artifact and re-adopted his own Marc Spector persona following yet another mental breakdown. His new path took him far away to Los Angeles where he created not only a Moon Knight television series, but new personas resembling Spider-Man, Captain America, and Wolverine. He teamed with the vigilante Echo to clash with Count Nefaria posing as the criminal Kingpin, but when Echo died in the battle, Spector took on an Echo-like persona to wreak terrible vengeance on his enemies.\n\nBack in New York City in the aftermath, Spector divided his crimefighting time between handling more extreme and often supernatural cases as Moon Knight with a more debonair, police-friendly role as Mr. Knight. Further mental instability drove him into an institution, a renewed relationship with Khonshu, and yet another break-up with Marlene. During a fight with Bushman and the deity Ra posing as the Sun King, Spector recently discovered he’d fathered a child with Marlene while under his Lockley persona, a situation that came as a complete surprise to him.",

      "biography": "An Earth girl adopted by the Eternals of Saturn's moon Titan after the rogue Eternal Thanos killed her parents, Heather was raised by Titan's Shao-Lom monks, whose tutelage awakened her latent psionic powers while helping her achieve physical and intellectual perfection. Unfortunately, she grew arrogant, a trait reflected by her adoption of the name Moondragon after she seemingly destroyed the cosmic demon Dragon of the Moon. The Dragon secretly survived inside her, bolstering and feeding upon the darker aspects of her personality. Thanos's assaults on Titan drove Moondragon to Earth where she allied herself with various heroes and joined the Avengers. Her questionable ethics and massive ego gradually estranged her from most of her peers whom she sometimes mentally manipulated. This culminated in Moondragon telepathically forcing the Avengers to aid in her \"benevolent\" conquest of the war-torn planet Ba-Banis, but the Avengers ultimately subdued her and turned her over to the Asgardian Gods. They placed her in the custody of the Defenders, who helped her truly reform until the Dragon's growing influence turned her against them, resulting in the destruction of both Heather and the Dragon. Moondragon was resurrected by the Eternals and her cousin, Pam Douglas, who developed powers of her own and became Sundragon. Free of the Dragon's influence, Heather remains arrogant and self-righteous, but genuinely regrets her past misdeeds and wishes to be a force for good in the universe. Moondragon has been a mentor to Hellcat, a benefactor to Jack of Hearts and a would-be lover of Quasar (who did not share her feelings), though her machinations have estranged all of them to some extent. For a time, Heather wielded the cosmic Mind Gem as a member of Adam Warlock's Infinity Watch whose members also included Drax, Heather's late father reborn in superhuman form; however, the Watch soon broke up, relinquishing their Infinity Gems. A friend and admirer of the late Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell), Moondragon has acted as an ally and advisor to his son, Genis, the new Captain Marvel. This led to a brief romance with Marlo Chandler Jones, wife of Genis's partner, Rick Jones; but the Joneses soon reconciled, and Moondragon resumed her travels alongside new love interest Phyla, Genis's sister.",

      "biography": "Karla grew up in the mansion of a Hollywood producer, the child of a butler. After her father died, her mother worked three jobs to put her daughter through college, and Karla vowed never to end up like her mother, to never put another's needs before her own. Despite building a successful psychological practice, Karla so disliked being dependent on her patients for income that she entered the super-criminal world as an aide to Doctor Faustus. Learning of Moonstone (Lloyd Bloch), she became his psychologist and manipulated him into rejecting the source of his powers, an extraterrestrial gem of considerable power, which she then absorbed to gain the powers of Moonstone.Karla worked briefly for the Corporation, controlling the Hulk and manipulating General \"Thunderbolt\" Ross into a nervous breakdown. She continued to pursue greater power, stealing Curt Connors' Enervator and searching the moon's surface for further moonstone fragments. First Egghead and then Baron Zemo recruited Moonstone for their Masters of Evil, and she aided each against the Avengers. After the last of these fights, she decided to serve out her prison term and give up her criminal life. However, when Zemo formed a group of villains to masquerade as heroes, he broke Moonstone out of the Vault and she returned to villainy as the Thunderbolt Meteorite. Upon encountering a young victim of Arnim Zola's genetic manipulations, a youngster by the name of Jolt, Moonstone nudged Zemo into accepting her in the team. She soon became a mother figure to Jolt and used her enthusiasm to create a power-base inside the team, rallying the others behind her. Zemo exposed the true nature of the team, but Moonstone opposed him, followed by MACH-1, Songbird, and Jolt. Zemo had brainwashed the Fantastic Four and the Avengers, but the small team of Thunderbolts, with the help of Iron Man, was able to defeat Zemo and Techno, his ally. After the battle the Thunderbolts had decided to pay for their crimes, but they were unwittingly teleported to an alternate dimension. In this world, known as Kosmos, Moonstone led the team to safety from the Kosmosian army and eventually executed the Kosmosian Primotur to ensure their return to Earth. Inspired by Jolt, she made the Thunderbolts see that it would be preferable to work for their redemption as heroes, rather than to be in jail. After gaining fake identities for the team, she led them away from S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Lightning Rods, and she managed to defeat Graviton using her psychological skills, making him see that he did not truly have a goal, that he lacked vision. However, the Thunderbolts disagreed with her, for she merely thought of the present and did not care for the future consequences of her actions. When the former Avenger known as Hawkeye joined the team, claiming they would be pardoned if they followed him, she stepped down as leader and allowed him to get the position.Soon after the Thunderbolts fought the new Masters of Evil, a veritable army of supervillains, and Moonstone decided to betray the team. But something inside of her snapped, and she defeated Crimson Cowl and returned to the team.Weeks after, Graviton returned, having pondered the words of Karla. He took over the city of San Francisco, turning it into an island in the skies. Thunderbolts attempted to stop him, but they were captured. Graviton offered Moonstone a place at his side, as his queen, but she laughed in his face. As the youngest members of the team saved them, Moonstone wondered why she didn't take Graviton's offer.During a mission against the Secret Empire, she become romantically involved with Hawkeye. But as time went by, she became haunted by nightmares of an ancient alien warrior woman, who whispered in her thoughts. Soon after, the team was targeted by Scourge, who killed Jolt. The death of the youngster hit Karla deeply. Subsequently, Citizen V asked for help against her own team, the V-Battalion, and the Thunderbolts agreed to do so, engaging the V-Battalion's operatives in battle. Karla was torn about fighting them, for they were heroes. She released a surge of her powers to stop the fight, making them all intangible, and fled, trying to find out what was wrong with her. Her first stop was Attilan, but the Inhumans were gone. She then searched the Fantastic Four's computers and found the answer she was looking for. She flew under her own power to the Blue Area of the Moon, where she sought the Kree Supreme Intelligence and demanded the truth. The Supreme Intelligence revealed to her that the fragment she referred to as the \"Moonstone\" was part of a Kree Lifestone, which used to empower the Guardians of the Galaxy centuries ago. The alien warrior woman that haunted her dreams was the previous owner of the moonstone, whose memory was etched into it, and kept steering Karla into the path of heroism. The Thunderbolts managed to catch up with her, and so did Captain Marvel, who offered her help. Led by Captain Marvel, the Thunderbolts went to Titan, where Mentor and ISAAC attempted to remove the moonstone from Karla's body. After a serious discussion about Karla's potential to do good, Mentor allowed her to keep the gem but erased the memory of the previous owner, leaving Karla's mind, and by consequence, her decisions, to herself.The team returned to Earth, only to find Jolt alive. She exposed Hawkeye, revealing the pardons Hawkeye promised would not be honored. Soon, the Thunderbolts chased Scourge, who was being manipulated by Henry Peter Gyrich. Thunderbolts fought the V-Battalion's Redeemers but eventually teamed up with them to defeat Gyrich, who was being manipulated as well. Valerie Cooper offered the Thunderbolts pardon for saving the world from her own people, with the condition that they would hang up their heroic identities forever. Karla Sofen was soon contacted by Graviton, who hired her as a tutor. In the following weeks Karla helped Graviton understand and control his powers in ways he had not even dreamed, making him fall in love with her. Graviton soon attacked the Redeemers, slaughtering the team. He also managed to keep many of Earth's heroes unmoving in the sky, as he lifted hundreds of cities all over the world as well, for he wanted to reshape the face of Earth into a semblance of his face. The Thunderbolts re-formed to stop him, only to find Karla at his side. In the end, she hesitated fighting them and helped them stop Graviton. However, his power imploded, sending most of the Thunderbolts to Counter-Earth.While trapped on Counter-Earth, the Thunderbolts became true heroes at last, rescuing thousands in their flying city, Attilan. Karla was given the task of reshaping the minds of the world's leaders, creating a new way of thought to ensure the survival of all. Soon after, Karla removed a second moonstone from that world's Lloyd Bloch (known there as the Phantom Eagle), dramatically increasing her own powers. The Thunderbolts eventually returned to Earth, leaving Jolt and the Young Allies to complete their task of saving Counter-Earth.When the Avengers later interfered in the Thunderbolts' plan to control the world's \"transnormal energy\", a failsafe was triggered-- a device that Karla had planted in her private plot against Zemo. The stolen energy was funneled into her moonstones, further increasing her powers. Karla attempted to use this energy to flee, but the Thunderbolts and Avengers combined forces to stop her. In the end, Zemo ended up in possession of both moonstones and Karla was left comatose. After recovering, Karla reunited with the Thunderbolts first with Zemo then under the leadership of Norman Osborn. Eventually she took the mantle of Ms. Marvel when Osborn created his version of the Avengers.\n Once that venture failed miserably, after the siege of Asgard, Karla found herself back in the Raft prison, but again she was allowed to participate in the Thunderbolts program now led by Luke Cage.",

      "biography": "MORBIUS\n\nNobel Prize-winning biochemist Dr. Michael Morbius creates a cure for his rare blood disease that turns into a curse! Attempting an experimental treatment, he transforms into Morbius–a pseudo-vampire with superhuman powers and an overwhelming bloodlust. Like a real vampire, Morbius needs to drink blood to survive. However, after drinking his victim’s blood, his mind returns to normal, and he becomes fraught with guilt, remorse, and self-loathing.\n\nIn The Blood\n\nFrom a young age, Michael Morbius lives with a rare blood disease in Greece. Fearful of her son getting hurt, his mother forces him to stay inside. His father, Makaoria—a surrealist filmmaker, author, and painter—was so often absent from his life that Michael could barely remember his face. Michael’s mother keeps the family going by working in her father's bookstore. Still, Michael sneaks out of his house to play with his friend Emil Nikos. During one of these excursions, Michael falls and gets seriously injured, which pushes Emil to promise not to let anything like that happen again.\n\nThe duo goes off to college where they both study science so that they could figure out a cure for Morbius' condition. Their research into using vampire bat blood to make a cure earned a Nobel Prize. Though Michael's condition worsens to the point where he breaks a finger lifting a mug, but the prize money helps fuel the next stage of the experimentation process.\n\nWanting to perform the next leg of his research out on the ocean for security's sake, he sets sail with Emil and fiancée Martine Bancroft. Though he is greatly conflicted about Martine’s safety on the vessel given the dangerous nature of the experiments.\n\nFeeling that death was imminent, Michael rushes an experiment to create new blood cells using electricity wearing an insulated suit with a high collar that would become his trademark look. The procedure turns Morbius into a living vampire. He strikes out at Nikos and kills him. Not wanting Martine to experience the same fate, he dives into the water and swims until a fishing vessel traveling towards New York City picks him up.\n\nA Monster Marvel\n\nMichael Morbius turns a weakness into a strength by focusing his natural intelligence towards finding a cure to the disease that ravages his body. He even gets to the point, with his experimental study into how vampire bats might be able to help his condition, where he wins the Nobel Prize! He uses his intellect and the prize money to fund the experiment that turns him into The Living Vampire.\n\nIn his vampiric state, Morbius' face changes to look more bat-like. His bones also become partially hollow which allow him to ride wind currents as if he's flying. His new form also gives him heightened senses as well as increased stamina, speed, strength and durability. He survives many a potentially deadly injury only to bounce back with barely a scratch. Unfortunately, all of these wondrous abilities come about because he needs to feed on the blood of the living!\n\nWhile he possesses many traditional vampire strengths, self-regeneration, minor hypnotic powers, gliding on air, he does not have their same weaknesses towards the sun, garlic and religious artifacts. He can regenerate injured tissue, but he is not invulnerable. If he has not consumed sufficient blood, Morbius’ body has difficulty repairing itself.\n\nHis hypnotic powers enable him to control even strong-willed persons like Peter Parker, AKA Spider-Man, for a short time. Under certain, unspecified circumstances his bite can transform others into pseudo-vampires like himself through an enzyme deposited in their bloodstream. Such victims usually do not truly die, and they act purely on bloodlust like true vampires. They possess none of Morbius’ regenerative powers and die or even disintegrate upon being mortally wounded.\n\nDuring a time when Morbius was infected with Lilin blood, Lilith’s demon children, he was temporarily granted eternal life and the ability to liquefy his body. His regenerative powers were also tripled during this period.\n\nBlood Ties and Alies\n\nMorbius is one of the world’s foremost experts on biochemistry and blood-related diseases. His expertise enables him to create an antidote for his victims, curing them of their pseudo-vampirism, though the cure does not work on himself. Morbius sometimes wears protective leather bodysuits.\n\nBlood Ties and Allies\n\nMorbius' mother does her best to support her son after his father, a surrealist artist named Makaoria, walks out on them. She also attempts to keep him safe from the increasingly devastating disease in his blood. Michael mostly stays inside, but sneaks out with his one friend, Emil. He and Emil attend college together in an effort to cure Michael's malady. There, he meets a young woman named Martine and the pair become engaged. When Morbius' experiment turns him into a vampire, he kills Emil and abandons Martine for fear of mortally injuring her as well. Though Emil later returns vampirized by John Falsworth, AKA Baron Blood, and attempts to kill Morbius, but Nikos shows mercy.\n\nDuring his time as The Living Vampire, Morbius tangles with the likes of Spider-Man, Doctor Curt Connors, AKA Lizard, the Fantastic Four, Jack Russell, AKA Werewolf By Night, and Steven Strange, AKA Doctor Strange. He's been a part of various incarnations of the Legion of Monsters and the Midnight Sons. Morbius even registers as a super human with the government which leads to stints in S.H.I.E.L.D. and A.R.M.O.R.\n\nBlood Feuds\n\nAfter his initial time as a misunderstood villain, Morbius became more of a hero which set him against the likes of, Daemond and the Caretakers; Vlad Tepes Dracula, AKA Dracula; Marie Laveau; Lilith and her demon children the Lilin; Wayne Gifford, AKA Basilisk; and Phillip Hayes, AKA The Rose. However, he considers his bloodlust his greatest, as-yet-unconquerable foe.\n\nLong In The Tooth\n\nAfter Michael was found adrift by the fishing vessel, his thirst grew so great that he fed on too many of the crewmen, drawing unwanted attention. He re-entered the water once again, washing up on Southampton where a six-armed Spider-Man happened to be staying in Dr. Curt Connors's house. Morbius woke up later that night, saw the Wall-Crawler and tried to feed on him. He would have achieved that goal had Connors not appeared, turned into his Lizard form, and fought the blood-sucker. Morbius flew off.\n\nDuring Morbius' first confrontation with Spider-Man, Lizard managed to get a sample of the creature's blood and combine it with a serum that temporarily returned him to his Curt Connors form. Spidey hoped it would also help him get rid of the four extra arms he'd sprouted, but Morbius made off with the serum, intent on ingesting it himself! Giving chase, the Web-Head managed to knock Morbius out and send him into the river. When he tried webbing his new foe out, he only managed to snatch the serum which helped return him to an average number of appendages. Of course, The Living Vampire survived the encounter only to torment the arachnid again.\n\nOver the next few weeks, Morbius fed, but also created another pseudo-vampire named Jefferson Bolt. Meanwhile, Martine awoke to find Nikos dead and Michael's notes, which told her the story of his disease and transformation. She also discovered letters from Reed Richards, AKA Mister Fantastic, and a Professor Hans Jorgenson. While Martine went to Richards, Morbius met with Jorgenson. When the scientist went missing, his friend Charles Xavier, AKA Professor X, sent the X-Men to track down Morbius. They managed to capture him and grab a very sick Spidey. With Morbius captured, Jorgenson managed to heal the Web-Head who had been infected by the vampire blood in the serum that helped get rid of his extra arms!\n\nEventually escaping, Morbius continued to struggle with his life as a vampire. He encountered the otherworldly Caretakers, Eric Brooks, AKA Blade, the Cat People in their own dimension, cults, possessed maniacs, a haunted old west town and a variety of other monsters. He also tried to become Werewolf By Night's master by giving him the Moon Stone again and also drinking some of his blood. Morbius paid a visit to Dr. Harold Ward who had been working on a blood machine that could have cured him, but the ensuing battle with Spider-Man destroyed it leaving the vampire even more despondent.\n\nLater, Morbius happened upon Martine in Los Angeles. She did not remember him, but their ensuing conversation returned her memories and they embraced, but he grew concerned about his uncontrollable blood lust. A more immediate concern lied around the corner in the form of Werewolf by Night! The pair went their separate ways over a fight with Jack Russell's furry alter ego when it resulted in the loss of a theory that could have cured him.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis Monster, This Man\n\nMorbius stoked his enmity toward Werewolf by Night and continued hunting him. Their ensuing fight led to an encounter with Theodore “Ted” Sallis, AKA Man-Thing, and Johnny Blaze, AKA Ghost Rider. This Legion of Monsters worked together first to attack Starseed, but they did not stay together. Morbius went on to fight Benjamin “Ben” Grimm, AKA The Thing, and Cutza, AKA Living Eraser. Thing and Morbius joined forces after a brief fight and used dimension-spanning palm-bands to take out the villain. Those devices swept him to another world where he found the Empathoid–a being that lived on others' emotions. Empathoid merged with Michael and made him return to Earth where he fought Spider-Man again.\n\nDuring yet another battle with his wall-crawling foe, Morbius got struck by lightning which undid his vampirism, but he still thirsted for blood! With a new lease on life, he began his research once again at University of California in Los Angeles. He analyzed a sample of Jennifer Walters, AKA She-Hulk’s blood and discovered a degenerative disease therein. However, when the students found out his true identity, they protested and some even wanted to kill him. He developed a serum to take care of the bloodlust, but also cure She-Hulk's condition.\n\nThe father of one of Morbius' victims got the drop on him and nearly killed the former vampire. He only stopped when Michael asked for mercy only so he could save Walters. The serum worked and allowed Jennifer to change into her jade alter-ego at will. Walters then defended Morbius in his criminal case, convinced the jury he wasn't responsible for his actions and got him a reduced manslaughter conviction. He was sentenced to five years in jail, but was paroled early for good behavior.\n\nWhile still in his human form, Michael offered his expertise when Susan Storm Richards, AKA Invisible Woman, had trouble with her second pregnancy. When Dr. Otto Octavius, AKA Doctor Octopus's name came up as a potential expert who could help her, Morbius encouraged Reed Richards to reach out to the villain. Unfortunately, the procedure failed to save the child. Morbius then tried to help Jack Russell with his increasingly feral transformations into his werewolf form. During one transformation, the West Coast Avengers showed up in search of the Darkhold, but instead got a face full of lycan rage. Morbius then told him what he knew about getting in contact with the Cat People before the team went off on their next adventure.\n\nBack In Black\n\nFeeling frustrated with life, Michael took a vacation to New Orleans where he met Marie Laveau, the Voodoo Queen. She fed off of vampire blood to stay young and thought she could do the same if she brought his vampirism back. Marie needed him specifically because Dr. Strange banished natural vampires from the face of the Earth. However, his altered blood did not suit her needs. He then witnessed Laveau's machinations turning Dr. Strange's long-thought dead brother Victor Strange, AKA Khiron, into a vampire.\n\nMorbius followed Vic to New York City and tracked him down where Dr. Strange interupted their brief battle. After his bloodlust dissipated, Michael pointed out that the man he attacked was a vampire. Strange was first surprised to see a vampire and further shocked to see Victor. Morbius worked with Strange, Clea and Brother Voodoo to keep Laveau from attaining the Vampire Verses from the Book of Vishanti, but failed.\n\nReturning to New York City, Michael led a group of homeless people who lived in the sewers. They brought him people to feed upon, including Spider-Man! The ensuing fight between the pair helped The Living Vampire realize he'd forgotten himself and he left his minions behind.\n\nRise Of The Midnight Sons\n\nThe tortured hero began to rekindle his somewhat heroic nature when Lilith, Queen of Demons, threatened to take advantage of the thinning of walls between our world and the demonic ones. He joined with Ghost Rider, Johnny Blaze, Blade, the other Nightstalkers, and the Darkhold Redeemers to form a loose-knit network of supernatural heroes. During this time, he reunited with Martine, but she unknowingly facilitated a mutation in him. When she uncovered the trick, she was killed, leading him to feed on her briefly. This altered version of Morbius was confronted by Ghost Rider and promised to only drink the blood of the guilty. Martine was eventually turned into a vampire to further torment Morbius.\n\nMichael got more goth gear and took on Lilith with the others, fought Basilisk, tangled with Nightmare, met Michael Collins, AKA Deathlok, and even worked with Spider-Man and other heroes to stop Cletus Kasady, AKA Carnage's New York-based murder spree. He also collaborated with Matthew Murdock, AKA Daredevil, to stop a virus orchestrated by a group called Snakeroot, teamed with Venom to stop the Demogoblin's machinations and helped save Blade's friend's life.\n\nDuring the rise of the Lilin, the children of Lilith, Morbius led a team of Midnight Sons, but had been infected by the Lilin Bloodlust. Possessed, he gained entrance into Dr. Strange’s Sanctum Sanctorum and let the Lilin inside. Strange helped The Living Vampire fight the infestation which eventually worked, but he'd already killed Darkhold Redeemer Louise Hastings while under its control. Back in control, he also helped take on Zarathos and The Fallen, after which he and the others became branded members of the Order of the Midnight Sons.\n\nDown the line, Morbius began to lose control over his bloodlust, leading to run-ins with the likes of Nate Grey, AKA X-Man, Spider-Man and even Hydra! He had yet another reunion with Spider-Man, this time when he and Blade stopped Kingpin from using The Living Vampire as a weapon. Though freed, he continued to become all the more monstrous. He also learned that a group of true vampires had been following him and turning his victims—who he tried to drain, but not kill—into the undead!\n\nA Team Player\n\nEventually regaining more control over his dark nature, Morbius signed the Super Human Registration Act (SHRA) and worked to take in individuals like Blade. This led the scientist-monster working for the Alternate Reality Monitoring And Operational Response Agency (A.R.M.O.R.). Unbeknownst to his coworkers, he'd been replaced by the zombified version of himself from Earth-2149! The zombie even fed off Morbius to keep up appearances. Not one to remain a snack for long, the real Morbius got free and killed his doppelgänger.\n\nWanting to wipe the zombie threat out regardless of dimension, Morbius put together a team consisting of Werewolf By Night, Jennifer Kale, Man-Thing, and Daimon Hellstrom/Hellstorm, AKA Hellstorm, dubbed the Midnight Sons. He even developed a zombie virus vaccine that would keep them safe and came to enjoy being able to unleash on worthy victims.\n\nAt some point, Morbius and other beasties joined forces to keep their fellow monsters safe from Hunter of Monster Special Force by setting up shop in Monster Metropolis under New York City. After Norman Osborn, AKA Green Goblin,—then head of H.A.M.M.E.R.—sent Daken to kill Frank Castle, AKA Punisher, some of the monsters gathered up the pieces left behind and Morbius put him back together, creating FrankenPunisher.\n\nThough he played dumb, The Living Vampire knew that these hunters were after them because he had a Bloodstone in his possession. For this secrecy, Morbius found himself captured by Hellsgaard. Castle lead an attack on the villain's compound to get the vampire back and sustained massive damage, so Morbius used the Bloodstone to bring him back to some semblance of life. After another run-in with Daken and some time on Monster Island, the gem turned Punisher human and he gave it back to Morbius and the others.\n\nMorbius kept pursuing his science outside of Monster Metropolis as well. Though he left A.R.M.O.R., he absconded with some equipment that he used to create a cure for the zombie problem. While trying to cure Jack Russell once again, Morbius found out about the illegal sale of Spider-Man's blood. This led him and the Wall-Crawler to find themselves in the presence of Martine, still a vampire. Michael killed her out of mercy and then got a sample of Spidey's blood to try and cure the Werewolf by Night.\n\nA New Horizon\n\nThough he briefly agreed to hunt down Menace's baby for Dr. Octopus, Michael began secretly working for his old college pal Max Modell at Horizon Labs, though he was only known as Number Six and protected his identity behind a hazmat suit. There, he helped cure the spider-based virus running rampant through New York City, and also worked on an artificial plasma that would not only cure him, but also help fill blood banks around the world! However, when a bad reaction to one of the tests drew Spider-Man's attention, Modell and Morbius' secret got out. The vampire then gathered some materials and went into the sewer to work on another test subject: Lizard!\n\nDuring this time, Morbius also continued to play a part in the Legion of Monsters who helped keep order in Monster Metropolis. He, Manphibian, N’Kantu, AKA Living Mummy, and Werewolf By Night worked with Elsa Bloodstone to uncover the source of a black ooze virus causing some monsters to rampage. Years prior, Michael experienced something similar while visiting the Rockhaven Vampire Community near Angel Grove, California and falling for a vampire, Susanna.\n\nDracula—who looked down on Morbius' science-based vampirism—later revealed that Susanna was an ancient vampire witch named Bruxal who created the virus! The current rebirth of the disease was traced back to Morbius himself who managed to come up with a cure to save the residents of Monster Metropolis. Morbius and the Legion also helped Taddeus Ross, AKA Red Hulk, rid himself of the malicious spirit of Leonard Samson, AKA Doc Samson, that had been haunting him.\n\nWhile he still worked at Horizon Labs, Spider-Man barged into Michael's lab after the body of Billy Connors had been dug up. Morbius needed the boy's D.N.A. to cure the elder Curt Connors. They worked together to administer it and Curt turned human again! However, unbeknownst to everyone else, his Lizard persona was still in control! While Spider-Man fought and eventually captured Morbius, the Lizard turned several Horizon scientists into lizard-people!\n\nNo Sleep ‘Til Brooklyn\n\nThat last fight with Spider-Man led to an arrest and a stay at The Raft. Morbius was there when Doctor Octopus died, but his consciousness had already entered Spider-Man's body! In the ensuing chaos, Morbius escaped the Super Villain prison and wound up in Brownsville, a rough neighborhood in Brooklyn. While there, he stopped a hood from robbing mother and son Wanda and Henry Evans, which drew the attention of gang leader Noah St. Germain and resulted in a massive gunshot wound to the chest for Morbius.\n\nWhen Noah kidnapped Henry, Michael and his new friend Becky went to save the boy and Morbius ripped Noah's throat out. He died, which made his girlfriend Rochelle furious. Phillip Hayes, AKA Rose—actually one of many backed by anonymous billionaires—had planned all along to get Morbius to that particular neighborhood to turn him into a hero before disgracing him. Michael did not take kindly to the revelation of this plan, but stuck around because Rose said he had his mother, but was in reality working with his father.\n\nWith the help of his new friend Becky Barnes, Morbius became a solid protector of Brownsville until Spider-Man (still under Otto Octavius' control) got the drop on him and brought the vampire to Modell at Horizon. Max offered to help finish the vampire cure if Morbius would help them figure out what a mysterious thief stole from his old lab.\n\nThe thief, Nikoleta Harrow, worked for Rose and pieced together stolen tech to create a far less powerful Ultimate Nullifer. Rose used it to attack Brownsville, but Michael evacuated the residents to Monster Metropolis. After Morbius dispatched Rose, he spoke to his father—though he didn't know it—and found out the whole ordeal was just a matter of clearing real estate! With that he decided to lie low, but did let Becky know he was still alive.\n\nMonster Mash\n\nEventually Morbius began using his genius in support of Shiklah, the monster queen. When she commanded the monsters to take over New York City, she had him working on a stolen Sandman Machine that could put the human population of the Big Apple to sleep. He succeeded and got it to his master, but also received several slugs in his chest for his efforts.\n\nAfter mixing it up with Miles Morales, AKA Spider-Man, a group of real vampires wanted to feed from them and then a human to spread his disease. He refused to lead them which got him chained and put into a box that Neena Thurman, AKA Domino, Rachel Leighton, AKA Diamondback, and Outlaw were hired to find in Norway. They got him out and began working together to stop the spread of the vampire virus.

      "biography": "Morgan le Fay is half-faerie, an ancient magical race originating from Otherworld who access Earth via Britain and Ireland. They are closely related to the Dark Elves of Svartalfheim, one of the Nine Worlds of Asgardian Cosmology. Morgan is said to be the daughter of Gorlois, Duke of Tintagil, and Igraine, but at least one of her parents must have been part faerie. Igraine was later seduced by Uther Pendragon, who impersonated Gorlois via Merlin's magic, and Igraine married Uther after Gorlois' death. Raised in a nunnery, Morgan was trained in sorcery by the legendary Merlin, promising to become his lover in exchange, though she reneged. Morgan in turn tutored Nimue (a.k.a. Vivienne). Morgan became a queen by marrying King Uriens of Gorre, though she secretly kept many lovers. Seeking to rule Britain herself, Morgan was opposed by King Arthur, whom she already hated for being the product of Uther's illicit affair with Igraine. Morgan also resented Arthur's promotion of Christianity over her own Celtic goddess-worship. She replaced Arthur's enchanted sword, Excalibur, and scabbard with hell-spawned replicas, giving the originals to her lover, Sir Accolon, whom she tricked into battling and nearly killing Arthur. The Lady of the Lake (Niamh/Nimue, not to be confused with Vivienne), who had first given Arthur Excalibur, magically disarmed Accolon, and Arthur reclaimed his sword and defeated him. Enraged by Arthur's survival, and by her own son Ewain thwarting her subsequent attempt to murder Uriens, Morgan again stole the scabbard and hurled it into a lake, robbing Arthur of its magical protection from injury.Morgan repeatedly plotted against Arthur and Camelot with her nephew Mordred; their relationship often seemed more than familial, and some texts portray Morgan as his mother or wife. Morgan's magic may have concealed Mordred's treachery from Arthur. Later, gathering occult students to assist her, Morgan assembled the magical scrolls created by the Elder God Chthon, binding them together as the Darkhold. One of her students, Magnus, became her lover until he saw the evil within her. Leading her Darkholders to Europe, Morgan summoned Chthon himself but the demon proved too powerful to control, and she imprisoned him within what would become Mt. Wundagore. Rebelling, Magnus stole the Darkhold and placed it within a tower on the Isle of Wight, protecting it with spells warding off beings of evil intent. Morgan slew Magnus for his betrayal, though his spirit survived. Having sensed Chthon's evil, Merlin had added his power to help imprison him, then led the Black Knight (Sir Percy of Scandia) to oppose Morgan's further schemes; during this time, an imposter (Merlin Demonspawn) acted as Merlin in Camelot.Morgan later tried to seduce Sir Lancelot, one of the great Knights of the Round Table, but he spurned her. Enraged further by Lancelot's affair with Arthur's wife Guinevere, Morgan helped expose their romance, plunging England into civil war. Morgan and Mordred then began to war against Arthur openly. In the final year of Arthur's reign, the Black Knight led the defeat of Mordred's armies, and Merlin magically trapped Morgan inside her own castle with a spell that would kill her if she exited. Merlin then had a trio of knights physically bind Morgan in iron, preventing her spirit or magic from escaping the castle, but these restraints were unwittingly undone by the Black Knight. Morgan's former pupil Nimue (Vivienne) later entombed Merlin within a crystal cave. A time-traveling Doctor Doom allied with Morgan, who agreed to help save his mother's lost soul if he would lead her army--victims of Excalibur reanimated by a fragment of the sword--against Camelot; but the time-traveling Iron Man forced Morgan to abandon her army, after which Doom and Iron Man returned to their own time. Morgan then sought the Darkhold to break Merlin's spell; realizing the book would someday be transported out of its tower, she plotted to claim it from the future. When modern era criminal \"Slapper\" Struthers stole Morgan's false Excalibur from a museum, she sent the spirit of her loyal Knight forward in time, transforming Struthers into the villain Excaliber. She sent him to force Magnus to reveal the Darkhold's location, but the heroine Spider-Woman defeated Excaliber. Recognizing Chthon's power in Drew (who had grown up on Mt. Wundagore), Morgan plotted repeatedly to claim the heroine, hoping to drain her energies and break the spell. Magnus ultimately led Spider-Woman's spirit back to the 6th century, where she knocked Morgan through a window, and Merlin's spell caused her body to crumble to dust. Morgan's spirit survived on the astral plane as well, and she cast a spell preventing Drew's spirit from reentering her body. When Arthur and Mordred slew each other, Morgan transported Mordred to the astral plane, too. At some point Morgan trapped a portion of the spirits of Arthur and his Knights beneath a castle in Gwillyn Dale, Wales, where they would be freed centuries later to help the Spaceknight Rom defeat an outpost of the alien Dire Wraiths. Morgan is said to have helped the Lady of the Lake and the Sisters of Glastonbury Tor transport the dying Arthur to Avalon (part of Otherworld), though her motives and the timing of such activity are unclear. Recovering her power over the centuries, Morgan transported her castle to the Netherworld, though its cornerstone remained and was eventually built into London Bridge. She tried to usurp Spider-Woman's body in the modern era, but she was foiled by the Avengers, Doctor Strange, Shroud, and Magnus, who sacrificed himself restoring Drew's spirit to her body. Morgan next possessed Lissa, sister of the werewolf Jack Russell, but Iron Man and the Werewolf drove her out. She subsequently used Mordred as her masculine familiar in a plot to restore her castle to Earth, which would resurrect them both and transform the planet into a dark reflection of Camelot. Despite the assistance of the Celtic Fomor, they were banished by the Black Knight (Dane Whitman), Dr. Strange, Captain Britain, and the Valkyrie. Next, believing that the undersea Atlantis was formerly the isle of Avalon, Morgan reincarnated within oceanographer Vivian Morgan and prepared to bring the island to the surface. Aided by a mysterious Priest of the Moon and by a new group of Darkholders, Morgan invoked the power of several goddesses and, using the near sacrifice of the Inhuman Triton with the ancient Atlantean Sword of Kamuu, she successfully raised Atlantis, killing 80% of the water-breathing Atlanteans in the process. Though further empowered by the Ebony Blade, Morgan lost her new home when the Inhuman city Attilan was transported atop it. Morgan later wielded the Asgardian Norn Stones, sending a number of Asgardian monsters rampaging across the Earth. She captured the Scarlet Witch, using her to tap into the power of the Twilight Sword and transform the entire planet into a facsimile of the 6th century, with Morgan as ruler and the Avengers as her Queen's Vengeance royal guard. Despite her virtual omnipotence, Morgan was foiled when the Scarlet Witch resurrected Wonder Man and channeled the Avengers' power into him; he tore the Twilight Sword from her grasp, restoring reality to its previous state. Morgan recently used her unnamed loyal Knight to manipulate the Wrecking Crew so that the Avengers would use Thor's magical arrows to stop them. Morgan overpowered Captain Britain, intending to slay him with those magic arrows, which would then, with his mystic connection reversed by her magic, destroy all of Britain; however, Braddock had foreseen Morgan's plot and had passed on the mantle of Captain Britain to a successor, Kelsey Leigh. Assisted by the Avengers, Leigh used her new Sword of Might to disperse Morgan's essence, though Morgan re-formed soon after. Note: Grace, of the Knights of Pendragon, is reputedly possessed by the spirit of the Pendragon once possessing Morgause (Morgan's sister), but the Pendragon of Morgan herself seems much more likely.",

      "biography": "Morlun is a vampiric being who has walked the earth for centuries. He feeds on the totems-- the core power sources of the universe. While he can feed on lesser sources such as humans and super humans, he requires a pure source to fully satiate his hunger.In his initial appearance, Morlun drew Spider-Man, who possessed the power of a pure totem, to him. Spider-Man and Morlun battled in the streets of New York, but it was quickly revealed that Spider-Man was no match for Morlun's overwhelming powers. Before he left, Spider-Man was warned that now that Morlun had touched him, he could find him anywhere. Hoping to throw Morlun off, Spider-Man changed into his civilian clothes, but Morlun's warning struck true, and Spider-Man was found.Having been offered earlier a place of refugee by Ezekiel, Spider-Man sought help from him. Ezekiel told Spider-Man that he was out of luck, as Morlun could now track him anywhere. There was nothing Ezekiel could do.Facing Morlun again, Spider-Man was surprised when Ezekiel leaped to Spider-Man's rescue, battling Morlun to his apparent death. Satisfied with the life force he absorbed from Ezekiel, Morlun left to return at a later notice. Unable to find Ezekiel's body, Spider-Man noticed that in his fight with Morlun, Ezekiel had managed to shed some blood from him. Studying the blood, Spider-Man came up with a plan to defeat his enemy.Morlun tracked Spider-Man to a nuclear power plant, where Spider-Man seemed as if he was dead, having absorbed great amounts of radiation. When Morlun went to touch Spider-Man, his hand was burned. His strength returned, Spider-Man revealed that whatever totemic powers might have been given to him by the spider, the radiation had played a role, and thus his powers were not pure. Spider-Man proceeded to deliver a sound beating to Morlun, but when Morlun was at death's door, he hesitated. Suddenly, Dex, Morlun's servant who had endured great suffering underneath his masters rule, drew a gun he had stolen and killed Morlun. Spider-Man let Dex go, and left, thinking that his nigh invincible foe was dead.Morlun mysteriously returned months later and plagued Spider-Man by sudden and mysterious appearances, warning him that he was coming. Spider-Man, for a reason not explainable by science, was dying, and Morlun hung back to watch the causes and effects of his ailment. Finally, Morlun struck, and in a climactic battle, Morlun delivered Spider-Man the worst beating any hero had ever endured. Morlun left when the police arrived, opting for a more appropriate time to absorb Spider-Man's life force, leaving the web slinger at death's door with only one eye.Returning soon thereafter, Morlun entered Spider-Man's room in the Emergency Ward and prepared to feast. Peter's wife, who was standing by his side, tried to stop Morlun. As it appeared he would kill Mary Jane, Spider-Man suddenly sprung to life in a ferocious display of mysterious new powers. Using stingers that sprouted from his arms, Spider-Man was seemed to eat his essence as Morlun had. Morlun apparently died, crumbling to dust. It remains to be seen whether this was a permanent death, or if the vampiric totem eater will rise again. Morlun has returned to life once again and he has set his sights on the proud African warrior nation of Wakanda. His objective was to claim the Panther totem that was protected by the Black Panther, T’Challa. In his quest to obtain the Panther totem, Morlun swept through the kingdom of the great Man-Ape, M'Baku. He tore through their defenses like a lion through a spider’s web and then the vicious devourer consumed the mighty Man Ape, by sucking the life straight out of his body.",

      "biography": "Morph has been successful since his mutant abilities manifested in his early teens. Immediately able to control his powers, he hid his abilities from others. It was not until Professor Charles Xavier asked him to enter his mutant academy that Morph realized his own potential. Xavier made him a part of his young team of New Mutants. Morph quickly became a best friend to all of his teammates and, although he was not the group's official leader, he was looked upon as a trusted confidant. He even completed a degree in computer engineering during his time on the team.Promoted to the X-Men, Morph's sense of humor initially grated upon the much more serious team but eventually his humor and humility won them over. He was instrumental in many of the team's victories and was chosen to be part of a pilot program with the Avengers, along with the Beast, as a public representative of mutantkind.Morph would return to the X-Men because, in his own words, \"he missed his freaky mutant brothers and sisters\". On a subsequent mission, Morph and the rest of the X-Men were facing off against a threat known only as Stonehenge when Morph became unhinged from time. The Timebroker informed Morph and the rest of the Exiles that the chains of reality had been corrupted and the lives they remembered would be changed if they didn't do as he asked. Morph discovered that in his reality he would be injured and put into a coma during a battle with the Morlocks. This coma would cause his physical composition to break down, leaving him in a liquid state.Morph adjusted to the stressful situation as he always did -- he joked about it. The team looked to him for comic relief from time to time, although he did grate on people's nerves in more stressful situations. Eventually, he would display his intellect on missions, including a battle with Galactus and saving a planet from a techno version of the Legacy Virus.The most important thing to happen to Morph occurred before their second mission. Mariko Yashida, her reality's Sunfire, replaced the dead Magnus, and Morph took it upon himself to help her adjust to the situation. The two became close and Morph began having strong feelings for her. During a brief rest from their hectic missions, the team asked Sunfire to go on a shopping spree with Morph so the rest of them could sunbathe without worrying about Morph's juvenile behavior. During their time together Morph revealed that his feelings for her were more than those just friendly. Sunfire told him that she was actually a lesbian. Morph took the news surprisingly well and hid his emotions in his usual manner - he joked about them. Morph still harbored deep feelings for Sunfire but kept it hidden.The Exiles battled on, fixing reality after reality and struggling to keep it together. Following one of these missions the team was kidnapped by Mojo, the insane evil dictator of the Mojoverse. Mojo considered Morph the best entertainer he had ever seen and brought him back to entertain the masses. If he didn't, Mojo would kill his fellow Exile, Nocturne. Eventually, Nocturne was able to escape and set Morph free. Mojo went crazy and threatened to kill Morph's friends. An enraged Morph was on the verge of killing Mojo when the Timebroker stopped them. The Timebroker revealed Mojo had disrupted time but he was a necessary evil and could not be killed.Morph continued to be the heart of the team until a mission in which Mimic was taken over by a Brood egg. During the battle, he killed Sunfire. Mimic was eventually cured but Morph was enraged. He was devastated by Sunfire's death and told Mimic he should have killed himself rather than let something like this happen. Morph stormed off and threatened to leave the team. Magik, an unlikely ally, followed and tried to calm him down. The two connected and despite her past attitude during missions, Morph realized Illyana was just a scared girl trying to get home. He remained angry with Mimic but helped his team fight against the rogue reality-hopping team, Weapon X. Before the battle began, Magik attempted to switch sides, believing her team was weaker. Hyperion, the self-appointed leader of Weapon X, snapped her neck and Morph was driven into a rage. He attacked Hyperion, who attempted to blast Morph with his eyebeams, but Mimic saved him. During the brawl with Weapon X, Morph fought against an evil Ms. Marvel. Their battle caused a building to fall in on them, killing Ms. Marvel but Morph was able to survive. Hyperion was crippled by Blink and then killed by Gambit who sacrificed himself so that Hyperion would die.The Exiles were triumphant and the Timebroker told Morph he could finally go home as his world was now repaired. Morph considered the offer but decided to stay with the team as he realized that they still needed him. Timebroker agreed and let Morph stay with the team. Morph also asked him not to tell the rest of the Exiles of his decision. Morph and Mimic reconciled shortly after Timebroker left as Morph had realized that Sunfire's death was not Mimic's fault and that it really was a accident.When they arrived to next destination they found themselves in Earth-616 with a new member Namora from a Earth-2189 where she was the ruler of Atlantis. There were many complications on this mission because her reluctance to work with the rest of the team and so he involved them in a conflict against the Fantastic Four and Namor inside the Baxter Building. Beak who had befriended the Exiles before the fight tried to stop the fight but couldn't really do nothing until Invisible Woman (who was in reality possessed by Nocturne) captured every exile in her force fields to stop the fight. Exiles then explained why they had come here, as they didn't understand the mission they have been given. Mister Fantastic realized that one of them had to stay in this reality specifying that it was Nocturne who had to stay. Shortly after this Timebroker appeared (even if the Baxter Building sensors didn't pick him up) and confirmed Reed's assumption to be correct. He also informed them that Beak was no unhinged from his reality and had to join the team on Nocturne's place.After this Exiles visited several different realities and fought several people including Impossible Man who had gone insane and changed almost every living thing in lifeless objects and world were they had to buy one bagel that started a chain event that stopped alien invasion. Assignment given to them from the Tallus started to change to be either more brutal or insane like transferring them to alternate earth were they forgot who they were because of the magical spell that changed hole surroundings and peoples appearance to medieval ones. They managed to survive this world but Sasquatch lost to her inner spirit Tanaraq that took control of her. They later managed to extract Heather out of the Tanaraq with a help of alternate universe Shaman and sent Tanaraq in to its magic realm where that worlds great beasts waited to get their hands on this \"imposter\". Then they were transferred to earth were Sabretooth had stayed long time ago and were ordered by the Tallus to kill Mimic. As they all declined to obey the order they all were moved to the next reality Earth-295 (Blink's and Sabretooth's home reality) missing Heather and Beak. Timebroker replaced them with this reality Holocaust. Holocaust immediately caused trouble but he soon realized that he needed the others to get his hands on the main man Timebroker. Using the M'Kraan Crystal and Tallus they managed to transport themselves in place best described as Crystal Palace some where out space and time. There they found wall full of people and soon realizing they are the old members of Exiles and Weapon X teams. They soon found the control room where they found several bug like creatures that were the Timebrakers that they were warned about but soon even bigger problem made itself known. Weapon X Hyperion revealed himself alive and that he was the one behind the recent suicide missions. Holocaust attacked Hyperion almost immediately and lost almost as fast when Hyperion sucked his energies out of his containment suit killing him. This sparked the fight that cost life of Namora and left Mimic and Morph severely injured. They managed to win when Beak temporally recruited two alternate Hyperion's (including the \"prime\" Hyperion from Earth-712) who managed to restrain him for so long until they send him back to his own earth that was dead radioactive planet. They also now knew that there was no Timebroker and that he was just a program that those bugs used to communicate with the team.As the most specialized in superhuman Doctor Strange were recruited to heal Mimic and Morph of their injuries as he did for Morph but former Weapon X member Deadpool killed him before he managed to found cure for Mimic. Deadpool still accidentally healed Mimic himself as Mimic copied his healing factor and healed himself. They then kept saving worlds until they noticed that something odd was happening in Earth-616. When they arrived to that universe Scarlet Witch had changed world so that mutants were the dominant species on earth (also known as House of M). Beak was really worried about his wife and they searched her out but he soon realized that she was not the same woman anymore. Shortly after this Proteus took control of her body. Proteus own mother Moira MacTaggert tried to stop him from killing people and shot him but she only managed to severely injure the host and Proteus left the body taking over Mimic's body shortly after his departure. As he now knows about the other realities from Mimic's mind he decided to have his fun in other worlds too and moved to another reality. Exiles all followed except Beak who stayed with his wife and was engulfed in white light as the world changed back. They tracked Proteus to several different worlds were he changed body when situation called for it. His victims included Justice, Hulk and last but not least Morph himself. They later managed to brainwash Proteus thinking that he was Morph and so he became part of the team but also great threat if his memories would ever come back. Recently, the true Morph returned and gave Proteus the chance to work together, and Proteus accept. However, Proteus was absorbed by the Crystal Palace, in Morph's place.",

      "biography": "Moses Magnum was fascinated with weapons as a youth. When Italy invaded Ethiopia, he joined the invaders against his own people. He eventually became the world’s foremost independent weapons manufacturer. When Magnum’s Deterrence Research Corporation (DRC) was hired to develop a toxic biochemical gas, he tested it on kidnapped innocents. The Punisher (Frank Castle) and Spider-Man (Peter Parker) shut down this operation, though Magnum narrowly escaped death. As Magnum Force, he established a mining operation on Katsyu Shima island to tap Earth’s core’s potential energy. His forces abducted geophysicist Amanda Sheridan for her knowledge of the region, but they were opposed by Power Man (Luke Cage), hired to protect her by Sheridan’s grandmother, whose grandson and his family had been killed by Magnum. Magnum’s drilling triggered a massive earthquake which Cage and Sheridan escaped, but Magnum fell into the drill shaft to his apparent death. He was saved by the mutant conqueror Apocalypse, who gave Magnum seismic powers in return for his servitude.Supplied with additional technology by They Who Wield Power, Magnum subsequently threatened to sink Japan if he was not proclaimed its ruler, destroying the port city of Agarashima to prove his intentions. Opposed by the visiting X-Men and national hero Sunfire, Magnum ultimately unleashed his power but was countered by Banshee, who burned out his own power to block Magnum’s seismic energy. The resultant explosion destroyed Magnum’s base, but Magnum survived. Re-establishing his company as Magnum Munitions, Magnum purchased the classified Deathlok cyborg technology from Cybertek. After the criminal High-Tech stole the technology, Magnum sent one of his agents in a massive “Terrordome” weapons platform to retrieve it, but was thwarted by Deathlok (Michael Collins). Magnum subsequently bid against rival weapons manufacturers A.I.M. (Advanced Idea Mechanics) for a defense contract, destroying their world headquarters after they refused to withdraw their bid. Magnum used the subsequent profits to outfit a new army, conquering the African nation Canaan and seeking to restructure it into a homeland for African-Americans. Magnum then sought to ensure Canaan’s economic independence by invading neighboring Wakanda, but Wakanda’s king, the Black Panther (T'Challa), foiled the invasion with Deathlok’s aid.For his failures, Apocalypse punished Magnum by stripping him of control over his power, resulting in Magnum triggering an earthquake whenever he touched solid ground. Desperate to redeem himself, Magnum made base on the massive floating resort Evangeline and had his forces steal an experimental seismic cannon to help stabilize his powers, bringing them into conflict with the Avengers. His control over his powers seemingly enhanced by the cannon, Magnum intended to destroy the U.S. Eastern seaboard, but was opposed by the Avengers and neophyte heroes Triathlon and Silverclaw. Knocked onto the nearby island of Martinique during the battle, Magnum triggered an earthquake that opened up a chasm beneath him, once again falling to his apparent death.",

But in his other identity, that of the ruthless underworld figure Mister Negative, he uses his extradimensional energy powers to corrupt anything he touches as the leader of a criminal empire.\n\nLand of Opportunity\n\nWhile his real name remains unknown, details about Mister Negative have emerged, as per his own account. Years ago, he was a “snakehead slaver,” or human smuggler, who oversaw the transport of Chinese citizens to the United States aboard a cargo ship called Golden Mountain. The immigrants included businessman Martin Li, of Fuzhou City. Li intended to go to the United States to join his wife, Yana, who had arrived there months earlier through a student visa. During the sea voyage, several of the passengers died of pneumonia—and Martin Li was one of them.\n\nAs the Golden Mountain approached Queens, New York, a storm endangered the ship and disrupted an arrangement between the snakeheads and a Chinatown gang the Dragon Lords, who were scheduled to pick up the passengers and ferry them into the city. Seizing control of the ship, the supervising snakehead caused the Golden Mountain to run aground. The crew fled in the only lifeboat, leaving the snakehead and the Chinese passengers to swim for shore. The snakehead, who had a criminal record in the U.S. and China, took Martin Li’s identity papers. He was the only one still healthy and strong enough to survive and arrived safely at New York Harbor.\n\nSeeking his colleagues in Flushing, New York, the snakehead found them dead—killed by Maggia gangsters led by Silvermane, who was expanding his influence over the area. Silvermane handed the snakehead over to his employee, the chemist Simon Marshall, who was testing a potentially profitable synthetic drug on unwilling subjects. The snakehead was experimented upon, along with teenage runaways Tyrone Johnson and Tandy Bowen, among others. Through the tests, Tyrone, Tandy, and the snakehead acquired super human powers derived from the extradimensional Darkforce, and then escaped. Tyrone and Tandy eventually became the vigilantes Cloak and Dagger, while the snakehead adopted the identity of Martin Li and found anonymous work at a garment factory in Chinatown. He became Mister Negative, determined to become a crime lord and take revenge on the Maggia.",

Sharon felt an extreme amount of guilt over his passing, but she was determined to show him that she could be the best at whatever she set out to do without all his rules and regulations. She spent the next several years of her life still looking for approval from her father by taking on incredible challenges, and dangerous physically active professions, hoping all the while that if her father were alive he would say he was proud of her. It was a moment she knew would never come. Stunt Rider After temporarily working at a circus, Sharon joined up with the professional motorcycle stunt team, the Thunderiders. When the Thing showed up looking for her, as Sharon was a physical twin to an \"ideal woman\" he fell in love with on a distant planet called Battleworld, he made a play to join the team. The Thunderiders had to decide between Thing and another rider called the Champ, and Sharon was the final vote. She thought a personality of his dimensions would be the perfect choice to replace her in the group.  Leaving the Thing and the Thunderiders behind, Sharon went on to chase other pursuits.  Rise to Power Sharon found out Thing left the Thunderiders soon after she did to join the Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation, and she secretly attended his matches. It wasn’t until he had a match against the Beyonder that she showed herself, stopping him from killing the being he blamed for all his recent problems; a choice he would have regretted for the rest of his life. She took the Thing on a vacation to watch her as a stunt woman on the set of Devil Dinosaur, the movie, and the two of them grew close, but Sharon only wanted a friendship where he wanted more. Still, she was by his side every chance she got including a time when the female brawlers of the U.C.W.F., the Grapplers, thought he was responsible for murdering one of their members. Sharon tried to help Thing against the super powered women, and her feisty attitude got her noticed by Auntie Freeze, caretaker to the U.C.W.F.'s women wrestlers. Auntie gave Sharon the name of a man called the Power Broker and told her that he could make her strong enough to join the Grapplers and the U.C.W.F. When Sharon told Thing about the Power Broker he told Sharon not to go, fearful for her safety. Sharon ignored his advice and again resisted his romantic advances. Pawns of the Power Broker Sharon decided to see the Power Broker and be made physically better, but she was attacked outside his offices by three thugs. Sharon was almost able to handle things on her own, but when Lieutenant Michael Lynch showed up, he finished what she started and chased the goons away. Continuing on her chosen path, Sharon agreed to the Power Broker’s terms and completed her phase one radiation treatments given by Dr. Karl Malus. When it was time for phase two's chemical injections (which would have addicted her to a drug the Power Broker supplied, thus placing her under his control, as he had previously done to most of the U.C.W.F. wrestlers), Sharon changed her mind and used her new found strength to break free from her restraints. She fled throughout the compound looking for an escape, and if not for the timely arrival of the Thing and Lt. Lynch, she might have been recaptured. Thing stayed behind to hold off the Power Broker’s men while Sharon and Lynch made their way back to Auntie Freeze’s hotel room. Auntie made a costume for Sharon resembling the costume of Ms. Marvel, so that is the name Sharon adopted for herself, but soon Auntie and the Grapplers turned on Sharon when the Power Broker put a price on her head. The Thing found out from Demolition Dunphy, another U.C.W.F. wrestler who got his powers from the Power Broker, that Sharon was in big trouble, and the Thing had to save her one more time. Cat Fight \nAfter she was rescued from the Power Broker, Sharon noticed Thing was beginning to mutate further during a wrestling match and took him to the hospital. The She-Hulk eventually found out about Thing's recent problems and went to help, but Sharon tried to stop her, knowing how bitter he felt towards the Fantastic Four at this time in his life. Even though she had super strength, Ms. Marvel was no match for the She-Hulk, but her athletic prowess and wrestling skills kept her from being beaten. The two women decided to call a truce, but it was too late to help Thing as he ran away from the hospital only wanting to be left alone. Sharon felt guilty thinking it was partly her fault he left like that. Emotional Scars Sharon and her new boyfriend, Lt. Lynch, had set out to destroy the Power Broker for getting so many people addicted to his drug-related experiments which she had been lucky to avoid all together, but Lynch sold her out. Again a prisoner of the Power Broker's mad scientist, Karl Malus, Sharon was not only a victim to his experiments in an attempt to take her powers away, but she became a victim to his henchmen who subjected her to unspeakable tortures while in captivity. However, Captain America soon rescued her, and together they brought the Power Broker to justice. Even though she accomplished what she set out to do, the nightmares of her abuse would stay with her forever.  Man-Hater Traveling to New York, Ms. Marvel happened to be in the right place at the right time to save the Fantastic Four from being killed at the hands of Diablo and his Elementals. With her new hatred of men, she almost killed the villain, but Thing stopped her and offered her a place on his team. Diablo used a potion to heal himself, and turned the hospital he was brought to into a castle full of deathtraps to slay the Fantastic Four. With Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman on sabbatical, it was up to the Thing’s new team including Ms. Marvel, Crystal, and the Human Torch to take care of business. The Fantastic Four held their own, but it was Ms. Marvel who defeated the villain once again.  Too Much Television is Bad for You The team's next threat was a living television image named Fasaud, and this new villain would be indirectly responsible for a new change in Sharon Ventura's life. Traveling into space to destroy a satellite necessary for Fasaud's teleportation abilities, the Thing and Ms. Marvel used a shuttle that was damaged by an attack from their new foe. Rocketing uncontrollably toward Earth, the shuttle was bombarded with the same cosmic rays that gave the Fantastic Four their powers and upon crash landing in Wakanda, both Ms. Marvel and the Thing mutated. She now resembled the Thing when he first mutated so many years ago, and she was horrified by her transformation. The couple was attacked by a Trans-Human Robot, and Ms. Marvel tried to get it to kill her, but the Thing wouldn't allow that to happen. The Black Panther showed up and shut the android down, stopping the fight and preventing further injury to any of the combatants. Facing Doom Doctor Doom was also in Wakanda after being expelled from his country of Latveria by the imposter Kristoff Vernard, and he offered Ms. Marvel a chance to join him in destroying Reed Richards and the Fantastic Four in exchange for curing her, but she violently refused. Returning home, the Fantastic Four soon found themselves at odds with Doom, but with the combined help of the Black Panther and X-Factor, Doom was defeated and Ms. Marvel accepted her new form. Fierce Competition  Standing side by side with the Four, she found herself battling such menaces as the Frightful Four, Master Pandemonium, Graviton, and Kang. She’s been to distant planets, subterranean lands, and even to the Negative Zone. Sharon rethought her position about starting a relationship with the Thing now that they had similar forms, and they finally found love. Eventually, Ms. Marvel became the only “Thing” on the team, when the original was transformed back to his human self, Ben Grimm. Sharon went to Dr. Doom for a cure but Ben followed, and ironically she was cured while Ben was again transformed into a Thing.  Sharon remained with Ben as a normal woman for some time until his old girlfriend, Alicia Masters, returned and attempted to rekindle that relationship. Uncomfortable, Sharon left.  Everything Comes With a Price Doom contacted Sharon, demanding she serve him in exchange for the cure she'd been given, and she agreed, hoping to convince Doom to cure Ben as well. She was sent to spy on the Fantastic Four, and the trusting heroes welcomed her once more into their lives. Doom and the Four inevitably fought, and during a key moment in battle with the Fantastic Four, he commanded Sharon to turn on the team who treated her as family. Sharon refused and attacked Doom instead, and he swore revenge before meeting defeat. With her secret out in the open Ben had a hard time forgiving her, but when Sharon went missing, his feelings for her compelled him to find her. He discovered her in an alley; her will to live left her again, because Doom mutated her into a grotesque form more monstrous than that of the She-Thing. Sharon decided to end her hopeless existence by throwing herself onto the third rail of the subway tracks, electrocuting herself, but her new hide was tough enough for the jolt to only render her unconscious. Mister Fantastic placed Sharon in suspended animation until he could find a way to cure her. When Reed was presumed killed not long after, the Wizard freed Sharon and recruited the confused she-brute into his new Frightful Four.  In her second fight against the Fantastic Four, Wyatt Wingfoot talked her back to her senses and she quit both groups, staying with Wyatt on his Keewazi reservation while she came to grips with who and what she was inside and out. Tumultuous Life Under undetermined circumstances, Sharon eventually evolved back into her rocky She-Thing form and even attended a \"girl's night out\" with the Invisible Woman and She-Hulk.  In this form, she amicably attended Ben Grimm's bar mitzvah on the thirteenth anniversary of his becoming a Thing. Years later, a human-looking Sharon Ventura, was seen with a group of individuals who refused to register with the Civil War|Superhuman Registration Act right before Iron Man and S.H.I.E.L.D. raided their underground base. At a later date, this individual was exposed as a Skrull impostor and killed. After the war with the Skrulls ended, Sharon was returned to Earth.",

      "biography": "Jamie Madrox's mutant ability was apparent at birth when a duplicate was created upon his being slapped by the doctor. Two weeks later, Jamie's father resigned from the Los Alamos Nuclear Research Center and moved his family to an intentionally isolated farm in Kansas at the suggestion of Professor Charles Xavier. From a young age, Madrox was given a special suit to wear that would neutralize his mutant power, but before this could be explained to him a freak tornado killed his parents when he was 15.Madrox spent the next six years alone caring for his parents' farm. When he was 21, malfunctioning control elements in the suit caused a power surge that released his inhibited power and caused the suit to begin absorbing ambient electrical energy. Confused, frightened, and driven mad by isolation, Madrox felt himself drawn to New York City. There, he clashed with the Fantastic Four until Xavier arrived to defuse the situation. With the help of Xavier and the Fantastic Four's Reed Richards, Madrox's suit was repaired and he accompanied Xavier back to his mansion in Westchester. There, Madrox's temporary madness was cured and, after learning to cope with his powers, he was invited to join the X-Men. He declined, and instead accompanied Xavier to Muir Island where he became a laboratory assistant to mutant researcher Doctor Moira MacTaggert. Madrox's ability proved invaluable to MacTaggert, and he quickly became a regular fixture on Muir. Unfortunately, Madrox also found himself battling against threats such as the alien Eric the Red and the reality-altering mutant Proteus, who possessed one of Madrox's duplicates in order to escape confinement on Muir. Proteus's possession instantly killed the duplicate, and for the first time Madrox felt the severe psychic backlash this caused. After Proteus was defeated, Madrox again declined to join the X-Men, preferring to remain on Muir with Moira and her lover, the X-Man Banshee. Soon after, Banshee's daughter Siryn came to live on Muir, and she and Madrox ultimately grew close.Eventually, one of Madrox's duplicates sought to remain apart from the original and live his own life. To this end, he drugged the original Madrox and joined Moira and Siryn on a trip to the U.S. to search for Sunspot and Warlock, two missing members of the New Mutants. Eventually finding the runaway mutants as members of the Vanisher's teenage gang, the Fallen Angels, the duplicate Madrox and Siryn were persuaded to join by the alien Ariel. During their time with the group, the duplicate Madrox and Siryn engaged in a brief romance. Eventually, the true nature of the Fallen Angels was revealed to be a ruse by aliens from the Coconut Grove dimension who sought to cure their race's stalled evolution by experimenting on mutants. Defeating the aliens, the team returned to Earth, but apparently disbanded soon after. The duplicate and Siryn rejoined Moira at the Xavier Institute to return to Muir; however, the duplicate had no desire to be reabsorbed and so created another duplicate to take his place on the return trip while he secretly remained in the U.S.Later, the original Madrox was possessed by the psionic entity the Shadow King during the villain's takeover of Muir; after his defeat Madrox joined the government-sponsored X-Factor team. Unknown to Madrox, the duplicate that had joined the Fallen Angels years before had since found a place in the Nasty Boys, a team of super-powered mercenaries employed by geneticist Mister Sinister. With the help of Senator Stephen Shaffran, a.k.a. Ricochet, a mutant with the ability to turn other mutants' powers and fears against them, the duplicate convinced the Nasty Boys, and Madrox himself, that he was the original. Madrox merged with the duplicate, but it was a ruse; he \"disassembled\" the duplicate from the inside and remained the dominant personality in order to expose Shaffran and stop Sinister. Later, when most of the team were busy with another assignment, Madrox and his teammate Quicksilver were sent to investigate a murder case in Maine in which the prime suspect was a young mutant named Rachel Argosy, a.k.a. Rhapsody, who had been fired from her music teaching job after turning blue and first manifesting her ability to entrance others with music. The man responsible for terminating her employment was found dead two days later, with Rhapsody apprehended at the scene of the crime. Exposed to the effects of Rhapsody's power, Madrox became convinced of her innocence and was set to break her out of prison when the truth was revealed. Rhapsody had used her power on the victim in an effort to make him see the error of his decision to fire her, only to accidentally cause his death.Following an attempted assassination of Xavier supposedly by the mutant soldier from the future, Cable, X-Factor and the X-Men teamed up to capture Cable's team of young mutants, X-Force. Among X-Force's number was Siryn, who confronted Madrox over their past relationship. Madrox revealed to Siryn that although he retained all the memories of her relationship with his renegade duplicate, he possessed none of the related emotional attachment.Among his X-Factor teammates, Madrox formed a close bond with Guido Carosella, a.k.a. Strong Guy. The pair shared an odd sense of humor and often joked around much to team leader Havok's chagrin. A psychiatric analysis by Doctor Leonard Samson ultimately revealed the reason for Madrox's humorous attitude. His living alone for many years as a child created an almost pathological need for attention to ensure he would never be alone again, and he was willing to do virtually anything - whether it be telling jokes, playing gags, or creative use of dupes - to get people to notice him.During a subsequent mission with X-Factor to the island nation of Genosha, one of Madrox's duplicates contracted the deadly Legacy Virus; when reabsorbed, it was believed Madrox himself was infected. The mutant prophetess Haven offered to cure Madrox of the Virus, but the attempt failed and he seemingly died. However, Madrox unconsciously stayed split into separate bodies, ensuring that the Virus would be contained in one body and not duplicate into the others. When the infected body died, the shock of its death caused Madrox to lose his memory. Later, X-Factor was sent on a mission to apprehend a mysterious figure that was revealed to be Madrox, alive and well with his memory restored. Madrox had been recruited by elements of the U.S. government that wanted to turn him into the ultimate secret agent, training him to become a one-man army. Madrox ultimately rejoined X-Factor until the team's disbanding after the apparent death of its leader, Havok. He then returned to Muir Island where he was reunited with both Moira and his X-Factor teammate Wolfsbane. Madrox subsequently worked in Genosha at the behest of Professor X to monitor the situation there after the rise to power of mutant activist Magneto.Madrox was then recruited by Banshee into the paramilitary X-Corps organization for which Madrox created duplicates to function as support staff performing duties ranging from communications monitoring to gunship pilots. Following the restructuring of the X-Corps into the X-Corporation global mutant search and rescue organization, Madrox worked with the group's European branch for a time until a pitched battle against the living bacterial consciousness known as Weapon XII apparently cost the life of his teammate Darkstar. Madrox subsequently quit and struck out on his own, sending \"long-term explorer dupes\" around the world to learn new skills before returning to be reabsorbed. Madrox then established XXX Investigators (later the name was changed to X-Factor Investigations), in Mutant Town with Guido and Wolfsbane, both Madrox's friends of the previous X-Factor. His first case was to investigate the murder of one of his duplicates by an assassin named Clay, who also possessed the ability to create duplicates of himself, which led Madrox to Chicago and Sheila DeSoto, fiancée of multi-millionaire industrialist Edward Vance. Unbeknownst to Madrox, who had become romantically involved with Sheila, she was the one who had hired Clay to prevent Madrox from interfering in her plans to take control of the Chicago crime syndicate. Sheila was ultimately killed after she was revealed to be a self-styled highly evolved mutant.",

      "biography": "Little is known about Mystique's past due to the fact that she can eliminate the outward signs of aging with her shape-changing power, and it's not known exactly how old she is. She apparently learned to use her shape-changing power at a very early age, for there is no evidence known to the public or the government that Raven Darkholme ever looked like anything but a normal human being. Years ago Mystique had an affair with Victor Creed and they had a son, Graydon Creed, the recently-assassinated presidential candidate and hater of mutants. Mystique has also claimed to be the mother of Nightcrawler. At some point in recent years Mystique became the protector of the young mutant named Rogue, and looked upon Rogue as if she where her own daughter. While Rogue was under her care, she maintained the false identity of Mallory Brickman, the wife of U.S. Senator Ralph Brickman and her adopted daughter, Gloria, was a result.\n\nMystique had concealed her superhuman powers and criminal intentions so well over the years that, as Raven Darkholme, she was able to rise rapidly through the United States Civil Service to the trusted position of Deputy Director of the Defense Advanced Research Planning Agency (DARPA) in the United States Department of Defense, giving her access to military secrets and advanced weaponry, both of which she used for her own criminal and subversive purposes.\n\nMystique organized the third incarnation of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, which originally consisted of herself, Avalanche, the Blob, Destiny, and Pyro. Mystique named her group after the original Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, an organization founded by Magneto.\n\nThis Brotherhood first became known when it attempted to intimidate the public by assassinating Senator Robert Kelly, who was investigating what he perceived was the possible danger posed by the existence of any superhuman beings. The X-Men thwarted the assassination attempt, and the Brotherhood later clashed with the X-Men on other occasions, as well as the Avengers and other heroes. Rogue was a member of the Brotherhood for a time but finally left to join the X-Men in order to find help in learning how to deal with her superhuman powers.\n\nAnti-mutant sentiment among normal human beings had greatly increased, and the federal government launched its own covert anti-mutant program, Project: Wideawake. Believing that the times had become too dangerous for the Brotherhood to continue its criminal activities, Mystique went to Dr. Valerie Cooper, special assistant to the head of the National Security Council, and offered the Brotherhood's services to the government. Cooper agreed to convey the offer to the President, on the condition that the Brotherhood pass a test she imposed: the capture of Magneto. The Brotherhood, now renamed Freedom Force, succeeded in bringing Magneto to the authorities (only because he voluntarily surrendered to them) and soon afterward officially entered the government's employ. In return, and as Freedom Force's leader, Mystique received a Presidential pardon for all criminal charges against her, but the pardon would be revoked if any member of Freedom Force was found committing a crime. During her time with Freedom Force, Mystique faced many new opponents such as the Grip, Avengers West Coast, and several other foes. During this stint, her team was sent to Muir Island and were confronted by the Reavers, who killed her teammate Stonewall. During the battle, Mystique charged Forge with the duty of protecting Destiny, which he did until Destiny convinced him that Mystique needed more help. After Forge left to help Mystique, Destiny was slain by a mind-controlled Legion. Afterward, Mystique swore vengeance on Forge for her friend's death, but a visit by a future version of herself convinced her to take some time off to mourn the death of Destiny. During her time off, she went on a cruise and scattered Destiny's ashes into the ocean.\n\nRaven recently made a deal with Professor Charles Xavier. Hunted by many countries for her acts of terrorism, Xavier offered her protection from being detected by them. In exchange, she was to act as Xavier's secret operative. If she was caught, Xavier would deny ever working with her. Former lover Forge aided her by providing technology while Shortpack acted as her handler. After completing quite a few missions, Mystique ended her working relationship with Xavier and infiltrated the Xavier Institute under the guise of Foxx, a student put in Gambit's squad. Her true identity revealed by Emma Frost, Raven claimed to want to join the X-Men and have a better relationship with her foster daughter. She has since gone working with a new associate, Pulse, who she thinks is a better fit for Rogue. Mystique's true motives, and who she was communicating with while inside the Institute, remain a mystery.\n\nRecently, Raven joined Norman Osborn's X-Men team, posing as Professor X and later as Jean Grey.",

      "biography": "Namorita was born in 1958 to Namora, half-human cousin of Atlantis's Prince Namor; unknown to her husband Talan, Namora became pregnant via genetic manipulation by Atlantean scientist Vyrra, who implanted her with her own clone, infused with genes from Atlantis's greatest warriors. Talan died when Namorita was three, and she and Namora relocated to Lemuria. Eventually, Namora grew attracted to Lemuria's ruler, Merro; however, Namora's rival, Llyra, poisoned Namora when Namorita was still a pre-adolescent. Llyra assumed the throne of Lemuria soon after, and Namorita remained in her care, suspecting her of Namora's death but unable to prove it.In recent years, Llyra plotted against Namor and forced Namorita to lure Namor into a trap. Namor foiled their plans and, reunited with the cousin he had not seen since her infancy, he entrusted her welfare to his longtime surface friend, Betty Prentiss. Under Prentiss's guidance, Namorita attended high school and college, and she took Prentiss's last name following her guardian's death. Namorita herself acted as mentor to the alien Wundarr, and when he attained adult intelligence as the Aquarian, she briefly joined his spiritual movement, the Water Children.When the alien menace Terrax surfaced, Namorita and other superhumans defeated him and joined forces as the New Warriors. After some time with the Warriors, Namorita was shocked to learn of her cloned nature. Reassured by Namor, she fell in love with teammate Nova, only to undergo a physical transformation into a more primitive and powerful form of Atlantean. Eventually regaining her original appearance, she and Nova grew apart, and she later dated the Human Torch of the Fantastic Four, although that relationship also ended. At present, she co-rules Atlantis with Namor and the warrior Andromeda.Recently, during a televised raid by the New Warriors of a building in which Cobalt Man, Speedfreak, Coldheart, and Nitro, who had recently escaped from the Raft, resided, Namorita followed after Nitro. Slamming him into a bus, Namorita taunted him, but Nitro screamed he wasn't the kind of loser that she was used to facing and that she was in fact \"playing with the big boys now\", before letting off a massive explosion that killed Namorita, Night Thrasher, Microbe, Cobalt Man, Speedfreak, Coldheart, all of the children at the nearby elementary school, and all residents in the surrounding neighborhood where the fight took place.",

      "biography": "Nathaniel Richards is a scientist and inventor who created the very first time platform years before his son, Reed Richards, flew into space and returned as the powerful leader of the Fantastic Four. Nathaniel fostered an insatiable love for exploration, science, and discovery in his young son; he also fostered a respect for the consequences of such science. But three years before the accident that gave Reed his powers, Nathaniel disappeared to part unknown, leaving his son two billion dollars and retaining the family’s butler and maid, Mr. and Mrs. Peacock, in the family estate. He did this to ensure that no one would declare him dead before his return.Richards actually sent himself into Earth’s future, but as the time platform didn’t work that way, it instead shunted him aside to a parallel universe. He found himself on a planet that had been devastated by a war that occurred centuries before, between the people of the Earth and the human colonists of the Moon, ending in the destruction of the Moon itself. Nathaniel traveled around the war-torn planet, helping people with his scientific knowledge, until one day he met the Queen of the dominant race of humans. He gave her the information to better her people and create for them amazing machines, including flying, metal dragons that they rode on. In gratitude, the Queen gave Nathaniel her eldest daughter to marry. Nathaniel later discovered a citadel that held powerful, yet ancient, machines, and rebuilt it to live in. The Queen and her people left him with a workforce made up of ape-like mutates from the Southern parts of the planet, but returned three years later to find the citadel transformed into a fortress, and Nathaniel seemingly calling himself the Warlord. The Queen discovered that-soon after the construction of the fortress was finished-the Warlord had attacked the nearest township and declared himself the ruler of the world.In fact, the Warlord was not Nathaniel, but his wife, Cassandra. She kept him lulled in his citadel, pretending to love him and eventually bearing him a son. But she secretly lusted after power and disguised herself as Nathaniel, in his armor. It was to this newly ravaged world that the Fantastic Four traveled, searching for Reed’s father so that Reed could fill in certain holes in his memory. They found people dressed as cowboys from the Old West, but carrying laser guns and riding on flying, metal steeds. The four soon met with the Queen, who told them the history of the Warlord, and Reed himself approached the fortress, alone, to reason with his father. Yet the Warlord attacked him, sending her troops against his team, until Wyatt Wingfoot snuck around and threw a rock into a powerful, anti-matter weapon that the Warlord prepared to end the fight with. The resulting explosion knocked Wyatt out, but killed the Warlord, Nathaniel’s wife.When Wyatt recovered, Nathaniel had joined them and spoke with his son. He was ashamed that he had been fooled for so many years by his wife and vowed to rebuild the world that his technology had devastated. The Fantastic Four left shortly afterwards, returning to their own time. Years later, Nathaniel appeared in Four Freedoms Plaza and explained to his grandson, Franklin Richards, that he had come to help him. The Fantastic Four soon arrived, and Nathaniel greeted his son and his daughter-in-law, the Invisible Woman. He explained that while traveling through the timestream he found a possible future of his home-Earth, where Sentinels took over the planet and eventually killed most of the mutant populace, including Franklin. Though Agatha Harkness announced that she detected truth in his words, she also revealed that he was hiding something that involved Reed. Nathaniel told them that the Sentinels were efficient because they used technology invented by Reed, himself. When Reed interrupted the conversation to speak with Matt Murdock, their attorney, concerning the Human Torch's brush with the law, Nathaniel was left with Agatha. She told him that she knew his mission, but would stay silent because she felt it necessary and asked if they would hate them for it. Nathaniel replied that they would, as they should.Once Reed was distracted with the problem of the Sentinel’s circuitry, Nathaniel made his move and fired at his own son, knocking him out. He revealed that his true goal was to remove Franklin-who he described as a danger to the entire universe-completely from their timeline. But Susan refused to allow him and prepared to fight him, though Agatha tried to stop her with her sorceress powers. Franklin himself turned on Nathaniel, angered that he had turned Agatha against Franklin’s mother, and used his psychic powers to fire blasts of mental energy that Nathaniel’s suit could barely protect him from. Susan quickly subdued Agatha and Nathaniel fended off Ms. Marvel who jumped in to help, whom he quickly subdued as well. Then Reed appeared and he and his wife fought Nathaniel together, though Nathaniel fired a neuro-scrambler at Susan to distract them. She blasted it out of air, and pointed at Nathaniel too late, as he grabbed Franklin and disappeared into the timestream. While Reed, Susan, and Agatha argued with each other about whose fault it was, a figure reappeared moments later in Nathaniel’s armor. They assumed it was Nathaniel himself, but the figure revealed himself to be a teenage version of Franklin, sent back from the future by his grandfather.Nathaniel later transported to Doctor Doom's castle and reprogrammed Doom’s robots to believe that Nathaniel was Doom, himself. He then disguised himself as Doom and revealed himself to the people of Latveria as their monarch. Nathaniel used Doom’s machines to contact his grandson, Franklin, telling him to turn to Nathaniel’s son to save the world, though he pointedly did not specify which son. While searching for Reed, Nathaniel’s daughter-in-law appeared at Castle Doomstadt, investigating rumors that Doom had returned. But she found Nathaniel in his place who announced that he was searching for his son, and asked for her help, but explained that Reed was not the son he sought. Nathaniel told Susan that he searched for his son, which he had fathered during his travels through the timestream, who became the absolute ruler of Latveria, implying to her that Doom was also his son. But his responses to her questions gave her little reason to trust any explanation or facts he gave her. Then, together they traveled to Tibet and the Monastery of Doom. While she fought the armed guards, Nathaniel found his own way inside and fired at Susan’s back when she discovered two sealed, person-sized containment tubes.While Susan looked on in horror, Nathaniel opened the pods to reveal Kristoff Vernard and Doom’s servant, Boris (who was actually Zarrko the Tomorrow Man in disguise). Then Nathaniel, Kristoff, Susan, and Boris joined up with the rest of the Fantastic Four to fight against Aron the Rogue Watcher, who had disguised himself as Uatu. But when they transported to Uatu’s base on the Moon, and Aron revealed himself and attacked them, Nathaniel retreated rather than face his powers. Nathaniel’s grandson, Franklin, and his Fantastic Force team later followed one of the flaming apparitions of Susan that warned them to help the Fantastic Four, back to its source using Huntara’s scythe. What they found was Nathaniel, posing as Doctor Doom, and using the fake apparitions to control his grandson and daughter-in-law. Huntara attacked Nathaniel, intending to kill him for his traitorous crimes, but Franklin stopped her before she could finish him. Then, Nathaniel took them to the Watcher’s base to join the Fantastic Four. After Huntara rescued Susan from the Negative Zone where Aron had thrown her, the entire group jumped into the cosmic rift that swallowed Uatu and found themselves in the middle of a trial. The defendant was the One, the repository of all Watcher knowledge, judged by Arishem, the Celestial Judge. After finding the last piece of a super weapon they needed to defeat Aron, Susan sent the Thing and the Fantastic Force to face Aron, while Nathaniel and the rest turned on the Celestials to save the Watchers very existence. They faced off against Exitar the Executioner, who had been powering up for centuries to obliterate the One, and Nathaniel explained to Susan that her powers came from hyperspace where the Celestials existed, and so they were enough to damage them. Susan used her force powers to tear a hole in the side of Exitar’s body and they entered him to destroy him.They eventually reached the core of the Celestial, where a mirage of Susan appeared to reason with them and explain the purpose of the Celestials. Though it recounted the history of the Celestials, and informed Susan that they needed to survive-over the Watchers-she lashed out and blew apart its nerve center when it attacked the One. The group inside the Celestial fell to the ground when it disappeared, and Uatu gathered them together in his shield, explaining that they had only stalled the confrontation between the Watchers and Celestials by a few millennia-as each group would eventually rebuild its strongest member. Then, when pressed, Uatu joined them and the other group against Aron, and used his own power to erase Aron from existence. He Who Summons appeared moments later and cast Uatu out of the Watchers for his crimes and excessive involvement, but Uatu was left with enough power to send the whole group back to Earth.After Nathaniel accidentally robbed the Blue Area of the Moon of its artificial atmosphere, creating a panic in the Inhumans that was only fixed when the Fantastic Four shrunk Attilan to save them, Nathaniel offered his services to Morgan Le Fay to restore the city to its original size. He interrupted his attempts to save the city when Hyperstorm began to plot against the Fantastic Four. Nathaniel tried to stop them from traveling to Latveria, but failed, and while transporting out his beam was intercepted by Hyperstorm. His future descendent trapped Nathaniel and taunted him with his failure to stop his own plans to destroy the Fantastic Four. Imprisoned, Nathaniel mocked Zarrko, making him insecure, which inadvertently sent him into the room with an equally imprisoned Doctor Doom, who had recently freed his mind enough to lock Zarrko’s gaze with his, and transfer his mind into Zarrko’s body. Zarrko then freed Nathaniel and they plotted to surprise Hyperstorm. Together the two fought their way through Hyperstorm’s robots, but Nathaniel separated from Doctor Doom-Zarrko when he saw his son, Reed, returned and being attacked by Hyperstorm’s robots along with his family.Nathaniel arrived to the fight in time to direct Susan to use her powers, as she had against the Celestials, and she tore apart Hyperstorm’s destructoids. But Hyperstorm appeared directly afterwards and they turned to battle him. Hyperstorm turned out to be too powerful, and Nathaniel and Susan convinced Reed that his abilities were better suited to finding a solution in Doom’s labs; so then Nathaniel and Reed left Susan to fight Hyperstorm alone. Reed tried to convince Doom, who used some of his own mechanisms to attack Hyperstorm, to work with him to defeat his future descendant, but Doom’s ego would not allow him to. Soon enough, Hyperstorm appeared and shuttled Doom off to his own Latveria, in his own time line, in order to embarrass him with his inability to defeat Hyperstorm. Then, instead of crushing the surrounding heroes, Hyperstorm healed the Thing’s face-which Wolverine had scarred-and sent them home, as well, commanding them to leave him to his plans, and not interfere again.When Susan later collapsed in a fight with an out of control Black Bolt, Reed blamed his father for teaching her to use her powers to an extent that turned out to be too dangerous. Nathaniel countered that he was merely teaching her, her true potential. He watched as his son worked feverishly to come up with a solution to the threat of Hyperstorm, though Nathaniel warned him continuously that he was wasting his time and endangering himself. Reed even went as far as trying to contact the Silver Surfer or Galactus to assist them, though the Surfer revealed that Galactus had seemingly died at the hands of his former herald, Morg. When Reed returned from his visit to the Surfer, Nathaniel and his son’s family watched as a time platform descended on Franklin, from Hyperstorm, returning Franklin to his true age. Forced by the situation, Nathaniel explained that he had previously stolen and aged Franklin because Franklin was destined to, one day, father Hyperstorm along with Rachel Summers, the child of Cyclops and Jean Grey. Nathaniel continued to explain that-in all the time lines he had researched-the Fantastic Four were fated to die at the hands of Hyperstorm.Despite Nathaniel’s warnings, Reed was insistent that he would find a way to defeat Hyperstorm. To that end, he traveled to the last known location of Galactus-with his family and friends stubbornly following him-and set up a machine to recall the world devourer. Hyperstorm soon appeared and attacked the collected heroes, and even Nathaniel turned on him and poured fire upon him, until Hyperstorm swatted him away. Then, as it seemed that Hyperstorm would win, Reed managed to hit a button on his device and open a portal to where Galactus lay exiled by his own hand, and the devourer grew angry at being summoned. Then he immediately sensed a source of unlimited power and energy in Hyperstorm and attacked him, feeding off of the hyperspace energies that Hyperstorm controlled. Reed’s device then shut back off, sealing both Galactus and Hyperstorm in the dimensional void, ending the threat.Before they could celebrate, the entity known as Onslaught attacked Four Freedoms Plaza-looking for Franklin Richards. Nathaniel jumped on his back, planning to use his armor to siphon off psionic energies from Onslaught; but Onslaught’s power was too strong, and he shattered Nathaniel’s armor, leaving him defenseless. After Onslaught kidnapped Franklin, Nathaniel gave his son one last, final warning, revealing to him that he had seen in the time lines that the Fantastic Four and many of Earth’s heroes were destined to be obliterated while fighting Onslaught. Reed ignored him, and Nathaniel left them to their fight against Onslaught. Seemingly true to Nathaniel’s portents, Reed and many of Earth’s heroes disappeared from existence while fighting and defeating Onslaught, but in fact they were actually drawn into a Counter-Earth created by Nathaniel’s young grandson, Franklin; then later brought back out to their home reality.",

      "biography": "Gemma Sinclair was a cleaning woman at the Los Alamos Atomic Proving Grounds in New Mexico who was exposed to a large amount of radiation when an explosion breached the facility's small atomic pile.  Though both of Nekra's parents were African-American, she was born with chalk-white skin.  Despised by her family, she ran away from home at the age of ten and met Jerome Beechman, the son of another person exposed to radiation in the accident.  Shunning other people, the two lived together in the desert for the next six years, surviving by their wits and educating themselves with stolen books.  When an angry mob attacked them one evening, the two manifested their mutant abilities for the first time, killing some of their attackers and driving off the rest.During this time, Nekra grew fangs while Jerome came to resemble a mandrill, leading him to adopt the name as his own.  Together they plotted to overthrow three small African governments and consolidate them under their rule.  The Nekra became the chief priestess of a personality cult based around the Mandrill, though their plot was frustrated by Shanna the She-Devil.  After their failure, Mandrill and Nekra formed Black Spectre, an organization of African-American women committed to overthrowing the U.S. government.  Though the group succeeded in taking over the White House briefly, they were ultimately  defeated by Daredevil, with the aid of Shanna and the Black Widow. Though Mandrill escaped, Nekra was taken into custody by S.H.I.E.L.D..Held in a S.H.I.E.L.D. holding facility, Nekra was drugged to prevent her from utilizing her powers.  Exposure to a broadcast of a rally by the second Hate-Monger, though, exposed her to frequencies designed to stimulate rage, which helped her to overcome the drugs and escape.  Coming upon a den of worshippers of the death-god Kali in the tunnels of New York City, she became high priestess of their cult.  She later established a base at a clinic for emotional research in an effort to understand her powers better, but she was discovered by Spider-Woman and, vulnerable to Spider-Woman's pheromone emissions, was defeated and returned to S.H.I.E.L.D. custody.Nekra recovered from her injuries more rapidly than her doctors thought possible, and soon escaped.  Through her contact with the Black Talon she met the Grim Reaper and, having found someone with passion and hatred equal to her own, became his lover.  Joining his Lethal Legion, she assisted in capturing the Vision and in creating a zombie of the Grim Reaper's brother, Simon Williams, in an effort to recreate him as he was before he became Wonder Man.  The plan failed, though, and the Grim Reaper died while escaping.  Nekra took his corpse in hopes of reanimating it someday.After battling Spider-Man, Alpha Flight, and the Avengers,  Nekra succeeded in reanimating the Grim Reaper's corpse, though in order to remain animated the Grim Reaper needed to kill someone every 24 hours.  The Reaper promptly made Nekra his first victim.  She was later resurrected by Hellstorm and sent to stop Doctor Druid, which she succeeded in doing by shooting him in the head.Nekra was recently seen as a willing donor for a Mutant Growth Hormone Ring in Los Angeles; in which was discovered by Darkhawk and the third Spider-Woman.  And although she overpowered the both of them; Nekra was defeated, due to Ricochet joining in to help his teammates.",

      "biography": "Details of Nick Fury's early life and career are sketchy and contradictory. He has claimed both that he was orphaned as a child, and that his mother is still alive; that he graduated college in India less than a decade ago and that he personally contributed to the end of the Cold War. Regardless, his status as a \"war hero\" is generally considered unquestionable. He has also said he has been prepared to die since the age of eighteen, but what happened then and how it affected his life remains a mystery. Years ago, Fury worked closely with spy Clint Barton (a.k.a. Hawkeye) to develop S.H.I.E.L.D., a worldwide high-tech security organization; however, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s directorship itself went to Fury's commanding officer, General Ross. Fury participated in the Gulf War, during which he lost an eye and the mutant adventurer Wolverine saved his life. When the most recent revival of the U.S. super-soldier program failed to yield results for six years, Fury recommended private enterprises offer competitive bids to develop the required technology and procedures. Companies such as Norman Osborn's Oscorp and Hammer Industries vied for this government contract, experimenting upon and empowering both willing and unwilling subjects. Meanwhile, S.H.I.E.L.D. developed the technology that would empower some of the government operatives known as the Ultimates. Fury is both directly and indirectly responsible for the recent, sudden upsurge of non-mutant super humans. Fury personally cut ties between S.H.I.E.L.D. and Oscorp, earning him the hatred of Osborn, who soon mutated himself into the Green Goblin. Around the same time, Fury went to significant trouble to free Wolverine from the mutant-enslaving Weapon X, a barely controlled subdivision of S.H.I.E.L.D. Interestingly, this was the same timeframe as Magneto's break with his fellow mutant scholar, Charles Xavier Whether or not Fury anticipated Wolverine's subsequent intervention in their conflict is unclear.  Fury also participated in various activities of questionable legality in his quest for advanced technology, such as cooperating with a Latverian effort to steal Tony Stark's Iron Man technology. Not long ago, Fury (now a colonel) was sent to Delhi, India, to investigate alleged violations of international superhuman test-ban treaties. He discovered a major project involving mass replication of mutant DNA, but was captured by enemy operatives. En route to Nepal, where the international secrets he held were to be auctioned off, Fury was rescued by the X-Men, at this time unwilling operatives of Weapon X. Shortly afterward, acting on a recorded message left by Wolverine, Fury led a S.H.I.E.L.D. invasion of the Weapon X facility, shutting down its inhumane operations and personally executing unit leader John Wraith. In the operation's aftermath, Fury established peaceful relations with the X-Men and recruited Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, leaders of the Brotherhood of Mutants, as covert government operatives.When General Ross stepped down from S.H.I.E.L.D. directorship, Fury, promoted to general, took his place. One of his first initiatives was the establishment of a black ops unit of mutant trainees, among them the mind-controlling Karma. Also serving in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s black ops division under Fury were his old friend Hawkeye and ex-K.G.B. espionage legend the Black Widow, whom Fury had personally recruited. Fury also gave the super-soldier program its first serious jumpstart in years, playing upon concern over mutant terrorists to win unprecedented funding used to form the Ultimates, a combination of mutants, mutated humans and wielders of advanced technology.  This team included the recently recovered Captain America, and operated out of the high-tech base called the Triskelion. The Ultimates faced an array of personal conflicts and controversies, notably project deputy Bruce Banner's transformation into the monstrous Hulk.  Hulk's destructive rampage was halted by the Ultimates, though S.H.I.E.L.D. concealed the Hulk's true identity from the public. Despite this, Fury forged the Ultimates in to a unique fighting team just in time to save the world from extraterrestrial Chitauri invaders (thanks in part to last-minute manipulation of the Hulk) guaranteeing the team a place in the world's heart. Meanwhile, an insane Norman Osborn planned to extort young Peter Parker (alias Spider-Man) in to helping him assassinate Fury. Anticipating this move, Fury introduced himself to Parker, taking him into his confidence and promising whatever assistance S.H.I.E.L.D. could legally provide against Osborn. After Spider-Man defeated the Goblin, Fury took Osborn into custody, where he was soon joined by more of Spider-Man's superhuman adversaries. Recognizing his own role in the experiments that mutated these men, Fury planned to give them his personal attention, but was distracted by the return of Magneto, believed dead after a fight with the X-Men months before. When Magneto and his Brotherhood attacked the Brooklyn Bridge, killing hundreds, the X-Men were implicated and Fury directed the Ultimates against both groups while overseeing presidential safety and developing new defenses. The X-Men ultimately defeated Magneto and Fury, remembering the debt he owed them, arranged for them to come under federal jurisdiction as a specialized peacekeeping unit. However, Fury soon learned that the X-Men would hardly be his most cooperative charges. Recruited by an anti-mutant government faction intent on overthrowing the President., they interfered with S.H.I.E.L.D.'s investigation of decommissioned Weapon X operatives, Fury undermined his own credibility when he asked Wolverine to murder a teenage mutant who had inadvertently killed an entire town and whose actions, if revealed, seemed certain to stoke uncontrollable anti-mutant hysteria. His trust in Fury and the X-Men eroded by this operation, the President agreed to form public ties with Emma Frost's mutant student body. However, this move finally drove the anti-mutant rebel faction into open treason, and they attacked the President's press conference with Sentinel robots. The X-Men destroyed the Sentinels, and Fury's agent Karma exposed the conspirators, restoring the administration's faith in Fury and the X-Men.Meanwhile, Osborn languished in the Triskelion's detention block alongside fellow super-criminals Doctor Octopus, Sandman, Electro, and Kraven the Hunter. Fury intended to hold the five indefinitely, discarding their right to trial, in order to learn their secrets and keep them from harming the public. Under Osborn's leadership, the prisoners escaped and attempted to extort money from the President lest they implicate him in Fury's activities, of which the President had been unaware. Fury rallied the Ultimates and Spider-Man to defeat Osborn's forces, but victory did not blind a shaken Fury to his own role in the fiasco. When Earth was plagued by a powerful psionic distress call which sparked mass suicides, Fury and a select team of Ultimates traced the call to an abandoned Russian base in Tunguska.  The team discovered an alien android called Vision, sent to Earth nearly a century before to warn humanity of a looming destructive force called Gah Lak Tus. Fury entrusted Vision to one of his contracted specialists, Sam Wilson.  The fact that Vision's distress warning had been pre-empted by Russian attempts to cannibalize him for parts in their own super-soldier project was not lost on Fury, who began to feel overwhelmed by the events he had helped set into motion. Fury has since suffered one setback after another, as his ties with the X-Men grew more tenuous and his friend Spider-Man began to seem more of a potential threat than an ally. His job was further complicated by the alien Kree, who stationed observers (including the defector Captain Marvel) to record Earth's death throes at the mercy of \"Galactus\". With the exposure of the Hulk's connection to the Ultimates and Thor's apparent breakdown, the Ultimates have suffered additional scandal. Their growing international activity has led some to regard Fury as a loose cannon ready to ignite a superhuman world war. To remove a potential wild card, Fury arranged for his own assassination by Mister Nix, perhaps the deadliest political assassin on Earth.  Fury killed Nix during the attempt. With the ranks of superhuman criminals growing and threats from outer space rising, Fury's responsibilities to the U.S. and the world seem to get heavier every day, and it remains to be seen how far he will go in fulfilling them.An optimistic Reed Richards, in pursuit of a cure for his best friend, Ben Grimm, requested S.H.I.E.L.D. permission and funds to send inter-dimensional data retrieval probes to various universes.  Nick Fury, fearing inter-dimensional wars, refuses to allow this and forbids Reed to this on his own.  Despite Fury's orders, Reed sends various probes.  A few days later,the Squadron Supreme, a group of superheros, of the Supremeverse arrest Reed and take him to their respective Earth for his heinous crime, destroying their Earth.  Nick Fury immediately begins assembling a rescue team from elements of the X-Men, Ultimates and Fantastic Four as well as Spider-man.  Once there it was revealed that Nick Fury was actually working with the greatest criminal mind of the Supremeverse, Emil Burbank,and Doctor Doom in an attempt to rule and destroy their Earth.  Once he has been outed, the Ultimates, X-Men, Fantastic Four along with Reed Richards, and Spider-man hand over Nick Fury to the Squadron Supreme as prisoner until they can find Doctor Doom.\nBecause he's prisoner to a foreign Earth, Carol Danvers is now the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. and is looking into all of Nick Fury's confidential information.",

Already a trained combat veteran with a host of covert experiences under his belt, Nick Fury Jr. claimed his birthright and started a new life in espionage, following in his old man’s footsteps as an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.A New WorldMarcus Johnson’s life used to make sense. He grew up a bright, gifted young man in Atlanta, Georgia who could have gotten a full ride to any university he wanted, but instead, he chose to enlist in the army first. After a tour in the Middle East, he got his Bachelor’s Degree in Philosophy from the University of Georgia, before enlisting again. He served in Afghanistan as a Ranger, alongside his best friend Phil “Cheese” Coulson—a man who saved his life more times than he could count. Like any soldier, he missed home, but didn’t think his mother would have to die for him to see it again…To Johnson, his mother Nia had always been a compassionate woman; a social studies teacher with a heart as warm as her mind was sharp. But after her funeral and the subsequent attempt on his life by Orion (Victor Uvarov) and his underlings from the terrorist organization known as Leviathan, Johnson discovered that his mother had lived a different life before his birth. After having his own life saved by the one and only Captain America, Johnson uncovered Nia’s secret history as a CIA agent. With that piece of crucial information came another bombshell revelation: his father was none other than Colonel Nick Fury, the former head of S.H.I.E.L.D.",

      "biography": "Son of World War I pilot Jack Fury, Nick Fury became a legendary hero in the early years of World War II, taking missions into Europe alongside his friend Red Hargrove, under the command of Lt. Samuel Sawyer. During a mission in Holland, Fury, Hargrove and Sawyer befriended circus strongman Timothy \"Dum-Dum\" Dugan who became a close friend. Hargrove was killed in the attack on Pearl Harbor that led the US to officially enter the war on December 7, 1941, Fury fought the Nazis in Northern Africa, then was reunited with Captain Sawyer, who made Sgt. Fury the leader of the US Rangers’ First Attack Squad, soon nicknamed the “Howling Commandos” for their boisterous battle cry. Dugan served as Fury’s second-in-command and became his closest friend. The Howlers occasionally worked alongside Captain America (Steve Rogers) and Bucky (James Barnes), who became significant allies. During one mission, Fury’s left eye was damaged by a grenade and his lack of medical care eventually aggravated the wound. At one point, Professor Berthold Sternberg gave Fury the “Infinity Formula,” which retarded Fury’s aging process, although it required him to take regular injections to stay alive. Late in the war, Fury joined the OSS and with the war’s end joined their post-war CIA agency.In recent years, Fury was selected as director of SHIELD, an international intelligence agency equipped with state-of-the-art technology by Tony Stark. Fury recruited many of the Howlers to the organization, notably Dum Dum. As leader of SHIELD, Fury faced the likes of Hydra, AIM, Scorpio (his own brother Jacob) and the Hate-Monger (Adolf Hitler’s clone). Fury was reunited with Captain America, who survived years in suspended animation, and the two rekindled their friendship. When SHIELD was beset by a conspiracy at its highest level by the Deltite, Fury allowed the organization to disband and later rebuilt it as a smaller unit he could more closely monitor. Fury also discovered he had a son, Mikel, who took the identity of Scorpio at first, but later joined SHIELD. When Fury learned of a conspiracy by Latverian Prime Minister Lucia von Bardas to equip super villains with specialized weaponry, he led a team of super heroes into Latveria for a first strike. Von Bardas survived the attack and in retaliation assaulted Manhattan with an army of super villains whose combined technology created an anti-matter bomb, which Fury’s superhuman protégé Quake (Daisy Johnson) stopped. Disgraced for his actions, Fury went into hiding and soon learned of a Skrull invasion which had infiltrated even the ranks of Earth’s heroes. Needing people he could trust, Fury recruited Quake and various other young superhumans into his Secret Warriors and helped defeat the Skrulls. In the battle’s aftermath, Norman Osborn gained mastery of SHIELD and replaced it with his own agency, HAMMER. Fury kept his Secret Warriors together to combat HAMMER and uncovered data alleging SHIELD had been a pawn of Hydra since its inception. Dum Dum gathered many of the ex-SHIELD agents loyal to Fury into the Howling Commandos Private Military Company and Fury helped set them up as his personal army.",

      "biography": "The son of soldier-turned-businessman Daryl Taylor and a one-night stand, Donyell grew up knowing little about his father. As an adult, he hated Daryl's legitimate son Dwayne, now the costumed adventurer and leader of the New Warriors called Night Thrasher. Donyell, calling himself Bandit, seductively approached Silhouette, Thrasher's estranged girlfriend, before confronting Thrasher himself. Although evenly matched for a time, Bandit played on his brother's insecurities and beat him severely. Becoming unstable, Bandit abducted Silhouette to lure Thrasher into a final showdown, but Thrasher won the rematch; although Thrasher was willing to reconcile with his newly discovered brother, Bandit departed, their relationship unresolved.Bandit soon became romantically involved with Silhouette.  She vanished when the New Warriors were scattered through time in a conflict between the immortal Sphinx and his reincarnated lover, Meryet Karim. Confronting the Warriors' support staff, Bandit agreed to lead other Warrior associates in search of the team, assembling a substitute Warriors roster. Teleported to Egypt by the alien power of Powerpax, they fought both the Sphinx and Karim. Then, upon the original team's return, they joined them in an all-out assault before the Sphinx and Karim merged into a composite being and vanished into the past.Angered by their relationship, Thrasher parted ways with Silhouette and Bandit, on worse terms than before. Bandit's own grudge was hardly resolved, and he sold information stolen from Thrasher's company, the Taylor Foundation, to competitors. When Silhouette discovered a former enemy, ex-drug dealer Scorch, was now doing business with Thrasher, she and Bandit disrupted a meeting and attacked both men.  Bandit had no real interest in the affair but gladly participated in anything to drive Thrasher and Silhouette further apart.Years later, Bandit turned up in New Orleans where he romanced Bella Donna Boudreaux, leader of the Unified Guilds. Although he furthered the Guilds' criminal endeavours, he perceived Belladonna's ex-husband Gambit, noted thief and X-Man, as an obstacle, and urged the Guilds to kill him. However, to Belladonna's outrage, Gambit revealed Bandit was manipulating her and had never broken off his relationship with Silhouette. The quarrel was interrupted when the Guild members turned on all three, but Gambit and Belladonna cooperated with Bandit to defeat their attackers. Bandit left New Orleans, and recently, reformed the New Warriors, using the codename of his deceased brother.",

      "biography": "Dwayne Taylor grew up believing his rich parents were gunned down by criminals. Taylor's guardians, the ex-military sergeant Chord (a friend of his father's) and the elderly housekeeper Tai, supported Taylor's vow to make all criminals pay for their actions, helping him create the identity of Night Thrasher.Taylor trained hard to be a skilled fighter. On his first outing, he met Midnight's Fire and Silhouette. These two superhumans were taking out criminals by gaining their confidence and then busting them. Giving his name as Night Thrasher, Taylor joined them on their crusade. One night, while Silhouette was infiltrating a gunrunning operation, the police accidentally came upon them. Scared that the police were fixing to shoot his sister, Midnight's Fire started to throw a blade at them. Taylor stopped him before he had a chance to throw it, and a gun battle erupted. Silhouette was hit and badly injured in the spine. Taylor, who had fallen in love with Silhouette, was heartbroken, as was Midnight's Fire. Midnight's Fire swore to get revenge on Taylor someday. Taylor left them, believing that Silhouette was dead.Realizing that he needed more of an edge, Taylor trained even harder. Using his parent's Taylor Foundation, Taylor had Chord provide him with a state-of-the-art headquarters, training facilities, and computer support systems. He also had developed specialized armor and weaponry. Taylor then decided to create a special team so he would have some backup. He recruited several young heroes and formed the New Warriors.\nShortly after they formed the team, Midnight's Fire made an appearance and tried to frame Taylor with the murder of two policemen. In a final battle with Midnight's Fire, Taylor overcame his fear of his nemesis and beat him in a battle. Taylor then discovered that Silhouette was still alive but crippled. She renounced her brother's actions, turning him in to the police and joining Taylor in the New Warriors.After the Warriors thwarted a plot by the criminal scientists of A.I.M., Taylor discovered a link between A.I.M.'s benefactors and the Taylor Foundation. With some investigation, he discovered dozens of illegal operations and shady business practices performed by the Foundation, linking them with criminal industrialist Gideon and the Japanese Yakuza syndicate, among others. Taylor used the Warriors to seek out the truth in confronting the Yakuza, but the team balked at making a deal with criminals. Taylor refused to budge, and the argument led him to quit the New Warriors.Taylor was then approached by the criminal team Folding Circle, of which Midnight's Fire was a part, since they promised to lead him to the truth of his past. In doing so, it was revealed that Taylor's father, while in Vietnam, was captured by Tai, who was a powerful sorcerer guarding an ancient temple. Tai had coerced Taylor's father and others in his military unit, including Chord, to have children with the women of the temple, in order that their children would later be sacrificed in the temple's mystic well of dimensional energies and thereby give Tai even greater power. Chord and Taylor's father tried to thwart this plot, and Chord was thus mystically ensorcelled to kill Taylor's parents. The Folding Circle was comprised of the children of Tai's prophecy, but it was assembling its members too early for Tai's wishes. The New Warriors, investigating Night Thrasher's activities, tracked the Circle to the Vietnamese temple, where they joined Folding Circle in a climatic battle with Tai. Ultimately, Tai was seemingly slain by the very energies she tried to master.Taylor rejoined the New Warriors and served with them for a long tenure. He left the team eventually, rededicating himself to his role as chairman of the Taylor Foundation, although he would team up with them when the need arose. Later, Taylor decided to give up adventuring altogether, becoming a full-time director of the Taylor Foundation. He believed that true battles for justice would be fought in the boardrooms. He moved to the Seattle branch of the Foundation, seemingly disbanding the New Warriors. Over time, however, the New Warriors reassembled without Taylor's help. Even so, as the Warriors continued to use equipment and facilities associated with the Taylor Foundation, he was able to monitor the new version of the team. He even rejoined them briefly against the assassin Junzo Muto and agents of the Hand. More recently, the Taylor Foundation suffered a massive downfall when its funding of cancer research banked on the efforts of Zachary Smith. Smith’s cure was revealed to be nothing more than his mutant son’s subconscious help. The Foundation’s stock tanked and Smith abandoned his son, but Dwayne Taylor stepped in to adopt the young mutant, now Microbe.  However, it would require more creative solutions to save the Foundation. Night Thrasher made a deal with shady television executive Ashley Brothers to avoid bankruptcy, but this also forced the New Warriors into a unique re-branding as a reality-TV show. Hoping to make the best of the situation, the team hit the road to become heroes for the common man throughout small-town America. The Warriors enjoyed mixed success and popularity, but the show was officially canceled and bankruptcy proceedings were initiated. Even so, the Warriors were able to return and continue their reality-TV efforts. However, when they hoped to boost their ratings by apprehending a quartet of villains holed up in Stamford, Connecticut, tragedy struck. During the battle, Nitro used his power to cause a massive explosion. It killed Night Thrasher, the New Warriors, and killed almost everyone in the vicinity.",

      "biography": "Born in Bavaria to the blue-skinned shapeshifting mutant later known as Mystique, Kurt Wagner was shunned at birth due to his having blue skin, pointed ears, fangs, and a long pointed tail. At the time disguised as the Baroness Wagner, Mystique's true identity was revealed after she gave birth to Kurt, and the pair were chased by an angry mob. Fleeing to the nearby falls, Mystique threw the infant Kurt over the edge and fled. Kurt was saved by his natural father, the enigmatic being known as Azazel, and given into the care of Margali Szardos, a sorceress and gypsy queen.\n\nMargali took baby Kurt to the small Bavarian circus where she worked as a fortune teller as a cover for her activities as a sorceress. Kurt was never legally adopted by anyone, but was raised by all the members of the circus, who had no prejudices against \"freaks\". Kurt grew up happily in the circus with his two closest friends, Margali's natural children Stefan and Jimaine. Stefan feared that his magical heritage may one day corrupt him, and so he had Kurt promise that if he ever killed without reason for Kurt to stop him. During his formative years Kurt exhibited tremendous natural agility, and quickly became the circus's star acrobat and trapeze artist with audiences assuming that he was simply a normal human dressed in a demon costume. Kurt worked closely with Jimaine, and the pair soon became involved in a romantic relationship.\n\nYears later, the Texas millionaire Amos Jardine, who ran a large circus based in Florida, heard of the circus Kurt worked for and bought it. Jardine intended to move its best acts into his American circus. However, he demanded that Kurt be placed in the circus's freak show, where he was imprisoned against his will and drugged in order to remain complacent. Eventually, a young boy would free Nightcrawler, who would threaten Jardine in order to make him remain a better owner to his circus friends. Nightcrawler then ran away and made his way back to Germany where he discovered that Stefan had gone mad and had brutally slain several members of a lost race of half-human creatures. Kurt found Stefan and fought him, hoping to stop his rampage, but in the course of the struggle Kurt unintentionally broke Stefan's neck. The villagers of the nearby town of Winzeldorf discovered Kurt and assumed him to be a demon who was responsible for the killings. They cornered Kurt in the town and were about to kill him when they were all psionically paralyzed by Professor Charles Xavier, who had come to recruit Kurt into his team of mutant super-heroes known as the X-Men.\n\nKurt agreed to join the group, but before they left for America, he and Xavier went to the Bavarian circus so that Kurt could explain to Margali about Stefan's death. However, Margali was not there, and for years she held Kurt responsible for murdering Stefan. Later, she learned the truth and she and Kurt were reconciled. Kurt was also happily reunited with Jimaine, who had been living in the United States under the assumed name of Amanda Sefton.\n\nAfter many adventures with the X-Men, including a clash with the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants during which Kurt first met his mother Mystique (although he didn't know it at the time), discovering his ability to be invisible in shadow, traveling through dimensions with Kitty Pryde's dragon Lockheed, and more, Kurt was finally severely wounded during the attack on the underground colony of mutants known as the Morlocks by Riptide, a member of a team of mutant assassins named the Marauders. Kurt was taken to the mutant research facility on Muir Island off the coast of Scotland where he recuperated, but discovered that he could no longer teleport as he originally could, and that teleporting others caused a great strain. After hearing of the apparent \"death\" of the X-Men in Dallas when the team fought the Adversary, Kurt, Pryde, Rachel Summers, Captain Britain, and Meggan became the founding members of the British super-team Excalibur.\n\nAfter an encounter with the monarch of Latveria, the armored despot Dr. Doom, Kurt's powers were fully restored after Doom used an electromagnetic scrambler in an attempt to disrupt Kurt's teleportating abilities which instead accidentally realigned them.\n\nFollowing a misunderstanding with Captain Britain over his relationship with Meggan that resulted in a broken leg, Kurt reformed the team of alien bounty hunters known as the Technet into a team of costumed superhuman adventurers dubbed the N-Men. Following the Technet's departure, Kurt became Excalibur's leader after the team gained several new members, including the alien Shi'ar named Cerise. Kurt helped Cerise become accustomed to her new life on Earth, which led to the pair forming a romantic relationship. This was to be short-lived, however, after Cerise was found guilty of war crimes and returned to the Shi'ar Empire.\n\nAfter Captain Britain and Meggan were married, Kurt along with Shadowcat and Colossus decided it was time to return to the X-Men. Kurt once more served as a dedicated member of the team until after the battle with the mutant despot Apocalypse that resulted in the seemed death of the first X-Man, Cyclops. Soon after, the ever-devout catholic Kurt left the team to pursue aspirations of becoming a priest. During his studies, Kurt was attacked and wounded by Rax, the hunter of the group of evolved mutants known as the Neo. Fleeing, Kurt encountered mutant doctor Cecilia Reyes, and together the two faced the Neo until the X-Men arrived to swing the tide of battle.\n\nKurt subsequently rejoined the X-Men while continuing his priesthood studies, but soon after took a leave of absence to mourn the death of his friend and team mate, Colossus. When he returned to the X-Men, it was as a fully ordained priest after apparently undertaking a ceremony at St. Michael's Church in Brooklyn which was overseen by Kurt's mentor, Father Whitney. Kurt even took to wearing a priest's collar as part of his X-Men uniform.\n\nFeeling uncomfortable after his longstanding Catholic training as a result of Kurt's feelings of unrest due to molestations by Catholic leaders, which were only exacerbated after the mutant ex-prostitute Stacy X joined the team and made advances towards him which he could not reciprocate due to his vocation. Ultimately it came to light that Kurt had never been fully ordained, rather he had been telepathically coerced into believing so as part of a plan by the Church of Humanity's Supreme Pontiff to bring down the Catholic Church by installing Kurt as the next Pope then revealing to the world that he was \"satan\". The X-Men subsequently defeated the Church of Humanity and prevented their plan for world domination.\n\nSoon after, Kurt found himself unable to resist the compulsion to travel to the Isla des Demonas off the coast of Florida. There, Kurt was manipulated into a ceremony with other teleporters like himself that opened a dimensional portal through which came an army of mutant demons. The X-Men arrived to recover their teammate and clashed with the army. During the battle, Kurt was forcibly removed from the ceremony which collapsed the portal, trapping all present into the other dimension. There, Kurt learned that the leader of the army, Azazel, was his natural father and the father of the other teleporters present. A mutant from biblical times, Azazel sought to use his children's combined powers to return to Earth and enslave humanity. However, Kurt rejected him and, with the aid of his newly-found half-brothers Abyss and Kiwi Black, Azazel was defeated.\n\nNightcrawler has since gone on several missions of an occult nature, culminating in a battle against the demonic Hive who was revealed to be responsible for Stefan's rampage. Nightcrawler would be visited by Mephisto on his birthday shortly after that event, who told Nightcrawler that a war was brewing, and if Nightcrawler would take Mephisto's side, he could have any reward he wanted. Kurt rejected the offer, however. Recently, Nightcrawler has also met the dimensionally-stranded Nocturne, daughter of a Nightcrawler from an alternate timeline, who has taken to calling him \"dad.\"\n\nRecently, Nightcrawler died while trying to save Hope (Hope Summers), the Messiah child, from the anti-mutant villain Bastion.",

      "biography": "Growing up in the Bavarian Alps, German mutant Kurt Wagner was kidnapped in his early teens by the black ops Weapon X organization. They brutally trained him for months to become their agent. Speaking no English, he was isolated from his fellow captives until the X-Men were likewise kidnapped and the telepathic Marvel Girl communicated with him. When the captives escaped with the assistance of the Brotherhood of Mutants, Weapon X head Colonel Wraith tried to flee in a helicopter. The X-Man Storm blasted it out of the sky in retaliation for his crimes, but Nightcrawler teleported Wraith out, insisting Weapon X had ruined enough lives without turning Storm in to killer as well. The ungrateful Wraith was about to shoot Nightcrawler, but the newly arrived Nick Fury killed Wraith first.Nightcrawler returned to Germany and learned English, ostensibly from watching television. After mutant terrorist Magneto, long believed slain by the X-Men, resurfaced, the X-Men became fugitives. Their enemies sought out their past associates, including Nightcrawler, who found himself pursued by the German authorities. Evading them thanks to his Weapon X training, he headed for Glasgow and Moira MacTaggert, whose contact information had been given to him by X-Men founder Charles Xavier. He nearly made it to her hideout before being captured and taken to Camp X-Factor in Guantanamo Bay. He was freed by a Brotherhood raid. When Magneto overloaded a Miami nuclear reactor, Nightcrawler was one of many mutants who helped evacuate the area. After the crisis was over, he joined the X-Men. During his time with them, he has hunted the serial killer Sinister, attempted to rescue his kidnapped teammate Rogue from Gambit and the Struckers, bonded with teammate Angel in secret pirate games in the Danger Room as the Dread Pirate Bluetail, and joined an unauthorized expedition to Krakoa to free convicted mutant murderer Longshot.Nightcrawler and other X-Men Colossus, Dazzler, and Angel went to Kraoka to free Longshot. The X-Men had freed Longshot and escaped not knowing that Mojo had captured Angel. Nightcrawler had teleported them in accidentally dropping Colossus on the way the X-Men fought Mojo and managed to escape with Angel upon learning that Longshot was indeed a murderer it was too late to capture him because he had managed to escape. The team was going to be punished for there action though they new that Dazzler was the reason, Angel stepped up and took the blame knowing that Xavier would not expel him. Much to Nightcrawlers dismay after the incident Dazzler admitted feelings toward Angel.His close friend Angel admitted his feelings toward fellow X-Man Dazzler as well and the two became a couple, though Nightcrawler himself had feelings for her to. He felt alone because everyone in the mansion had at least some type of romantic connection except him and Colossus. When his then friend Colossus revealed to him that he was a homosexual and dating Northstar, Nightcrawler pretended to be okay with it. But when Dazzler was comatose by Lady Deathstrike, he teleported to her bedside daily and spoke to her saying that he was never okay with it and now avoids Colossus because he is now dead to him. Recently While visiting Dazzler she had awoken much to Nightcrawlers dismay her first words to him were about the whereabouts of her boyfriend Angel, Kurt teleported from the room back to the mansion never telling anyone not even Angel that Dazzler had awoken.Afterwards, he kidnapped Dazzler and took her to a cave, seemingly lost his mind. After the X-Men finally find and save Dazzler, she quits the team. Professor X puts Nightcrawler into a deep mental trance to help rehabilitate him. When Rouge breifly touches Nightcrawler, she calls him a monster and runs away screaming.",

      "biography": "Kyle Richmond lived a privileged life of luxury, making him spoiled, irresponsible, and insubordinate. His irresponsibility led to tragedy, however, when he drove drunk and caused an accident that killed his girlfriend. He sought refuge in being drafted for the army, but he was rejected when a physical revealed he had a heart murmur. He threw himself into his life of luxury, all the while secretly searching for a cure. Finding a mysterious formula in an ancient book, Kyle re-created and drank it, discovering his body gained superhuman powers, but only at night. The Grandmaster immediately appeared, revealing that it was he who arranged for Kyle to find the formula. The Grandmaster then had him take the identity of Nighthawk in order to form the Squadron Sinister and fight the Avengers, who themselves were pawns of the Grandmaster’s opponent, Kang the Conqueror. Although the Squadron was defeated, the Grandmaster kept his word and returned Kyle and the others to Earth with their powers. Kyle continued to use his Nighthawk identity for idle amusement, running into conflict with Daredevil. A few months later, he and the other members of the Squadron Sinister were hired by the alien geographer, Nebulon. Nebulon and the Squadron Sinister tried to melt the polar ice caps, but Nighthawk grew uncomfortable with the situation and, acting responsibly for the first time in his life, he contacted the Defenders to help defeat the Squadron. In the conflict, Nighthawk threw himself in front of Nebulon’s laser cannon, stopping the plot at the risk of his life. Doctor Strange cast a spell to revive Nighthawk, and Kyle became an associate of the team. Nighthawk found a new sense of purpose as a member of the Defenders. He updated his costume with a jet-powered glider and turned his private riding academy into a team headquarters. He even became a de facto leader of the group, serving faithfully except for a brief period when he retired his identity to deal with an IRS investigation. Later, after stopping the demonic Six-Fingered Hand, the spell Doctor Strange had used to revive Nighthawk was disrupted. Kyle found himself completely paralyzed during the day, having his superpowers and full mobility only at night. Kyle tried to return to college, where he found his former girlfriend, Mindy Williams, had not died during their earlier accident but was severely crippled. Mindy was, in fact, a telepath, and she tried to gain revenge on Nighthawk, who was saved with the help of Spider-Man. Soon after, Nighthawk learned Mindy was an unwilling tool of August Masters, a super-patriot who hoped to use the collective psychic might of Mindy and other telepaths to attack the Soviet Union. He contacted the Defenders to help defeat masters, although it was the six telepaths, funneling their collective power into Nighthawk, that were able to destroy the complex. Although the Defenders escaped, Kyle, the telepaths, and Masters were all inside when it exploded.  Kyle was hospitalized and believed dead, but it was soon discovered he was in fact in a coma, when he recuperated faster when blocked from the sun’s rays during the day. During his time in a coma, Kyle was approached by an angelic being that told Nighhawk his role on Earth was far from over. When Kyle awoke, he possessed a special psychic vision that allowed him to perceive evil deeds before they would occur, and Nighthawk resumed his crime-fighting career by taking a proactive approach to defeat crime before it happened. This crusade, however, had all the seeming of a costumed man beating up innocent people, and Daredevil, rightfully concerned, confronted Nighthawk.  Although Nighthawk tried to recruit Daredevil, both were killed in a subsequent conflict. In fact, this was all according to Mephisto’s plan, who had posed as the angel giving Nighthawk his new vision and purpose, knowing that Kyle was on his way to a better afterlife and was determined to stop him. Nighthawk, by force of will, dragged Daredevil with him physically out of hell and back into the land of the living, thwarting Mephisto’s plans.Kyle sought help from Papa Hagg to remove Mephisto’s influence, and he kept his Nighthawk costume at the ready. Finally, after a long hiatus, the Defenders were reunited after his former teammate Hellcat brought the original founders together to defeat Yandroth the Magician. As a result of the battle, several of the Defenders were cursed to continually band together, and Nighthawk and the remaining Defenders elected to stay together as a team to support them. Nighthawk, in particular, was thrilled to once again be a part of the team. He had Papa Hagg magically transport the support Defenders whenever the core team would be cursed to appear at a trouble spot. However, as part of the curse, the core Defenders found themselves distancing themselves from humanity. They finally struck upon the idea that in order to have peace, they would enforce it by ruling the world. Nighthawk and the support Defenders organized a team to defeat the so-called Order, after which the Defenders were freed from their curse but disbanded once again.Recently, Nighthawk began to notice that his superhuman powers were steadily increasing. About the same time, a division of Richmond Enterprises was robbed by former Squadron member Speed Demon, prompting Nighthawk to seek him out. Speed Demon was actually performing robberies in order to fund his new team, the Thunderbolts. Nighthawk confronted Speed Demon, but they were in turn confronted by a revived Squadron Sinister, who took Nighthawk and Speed Demon away with them. The Squadron hoped to take over the world in order to better solve the world’s problems, but they were stopped by the Thunderbolts. Speed Demon hoped to trick the Squadron into thinking he would help them, but he turned on them, helping the Thunderbolts force them to escape. Nevertheless, Songbird ultimately kicked Speed Demon out of the Thunderbolts because of his previous robberies, claiming that what the Thunderbolts needed more were members whose hearts were behind their efforts to reform. She then invited Nighthawk to join them, and he agreed. However, it wasn’t long before the Thunderbolts were rejoined by Baron Zemo, and Nighthawk decided to quit rather than work with the former criminal. (It was also revealed that Songbird only wanted Nighthawk as a member to help fund the team.) \n \nNighthawk returned to the Squadron Sinister, who preferred to be called Supreme Power, finding them again recruited by the Grandmaster. This time, the Grandmaster claimed that the stakes of the game would affect the entire universe, and he hoped to use the Squadron to find the Wellspring of Power, from which he drew upon to grant the Squadron their abilities.",

      "biography": "Ruler of his own Nightmare World within the Dream Dimension (linked to and shaped by humanity's collective unconscious), Nightmare is a Class Three demon who influences the dreams of living beings as they sleep, feeding on humanity's psychic energies in particular. Nightmare occasionally singles out souls for special tortures, sometimes trapping their dream-selves in his realm. He has even sought to absorb the entire waking world into his own realm, though never with lasting success. Humanity's chief defender against Nightmare is the sorcerer Doctor Strange, who has fought the demon so often that Strange routinely casts a protective spell on himself before sleeping. Nightmare has also faced many other foes such as Clea, Spider-Man, the Micronauts, Dazzler, Ghost Rider (John Blaze and Dan Ketch), the Hulk, Cloak &amp; Dagger, Excalibur, Daredevil, Straw Man, Doctor Doom, Wolverine, Sleepwalker, the Enchantress, Heimdall, Morbius, Emma Frost, Captain America, Black Panther and Moon Knight. Nightmare has worked to corrupt unstable super-beings such as the Hulk and Cloak, each of whom have gone on mad Nightmare-inspired rampages, but his influence usually proves temporary. For a time, Nightmare was allied with rival fear-sowing entities such as the Fear Lords, but the group was thwarted by Dr. Strange and his allies. Eight hundred years ago, Nightmare impregnated the demon succubus Zhilla Char; she died giving birth to their daughter, the Dreamqueen, who now rules her own nightmarish pocket dimension. For a time, Nightmare courted horror movie actress Roxanne in the mortal guise of Edvard Haberdash, helping her longtime director Lucre establish Club Fear where patrons paid to be terrified. \"Edvard\" eventually caused Lucre's demise, and Roxanne forced herself to keep dating the abusive, possessive, inhuman \"Edvard\" since she feared for her own safety and that of the world in the face of a wrathful Nightmare's power. During a recent terror attack, Nightmare exploited humanity's desire that it was just a dream, gaining a foothold on an earthly island where he can manipulate reality at whim.

      "biography": "Robert Hunter was an retired electrical engineer who operated a ham radio as a hobby before the Lunatic Legion, a group of rebel Kree who had been monitoring his broadcasts, chose him to become their agent. The Legion took him to a hidden genetics laboratory and genetically altered his body, endowing him with the ability to explode his body's molecules and reassemble them at will. Dubbing him Nitro, they sent him to acquire Compound Thirteen, a dangerous nerve gas being developed by the U. S. Army. This led him into a direct confrontation with Captain Mar-Vell, in which he was defeated and left in a gaseous state.After months of effort, Nitro reintegrated himself and searched for Mar-Vell in order to gain retribution. While searching for Mar-Vell, Nitro mistook the alien Omega for his enemy, and attacked him, but was defeated by Omega when a titanium steel cylinder was placed around Nitro as he exploded, causing him to be rocketed into the stratosphere.Later, Nitro again reintegrated, and lured Mar-Vell into battle. Mar-Vell subdued him once again by capturing half of Nitro (while in his gaseous state) in a container, preventing him from physically reintegrating. This container, and a second filled with the other half of Nitro's gaseous substance, was taken to the government energy facility Project: Pegasus for study. He was later released when his daughter Virginia acquired a court order in order to permit him to stand trial. Once both of the substances were recombined, he escaped and wreaked havoc in Manhattan until Spider-Man trapped him in a container partly filled with a nausea gas. Nitro later escaped once again to resume his criminal career.Shortly after escaping, Nitro accepted a contract from the Mandarin to battle Iron Man, but was again defeated. During the battle Iron Man detected the emission of a certain frequency before each explosion, and quickly deduced that it was what caused Nitro to explode at will. He duplicated the signal, weakened Nitro by repeated explosions which in turn knocked him out. Iron Man gave him over to S.H.I.E.L.D.. who again placed Nitro into custody, eventually ending up at the super villain facility at Ryker's Island prison. He was among the many criminals to escape during a massive super villain breakout on  Ryker's Island.Recently, he was located in Stamford, Connecticut during a televised raid of a house containing him, the Cobalt Man, Speedfreek, and Coldheart. During the battle Nitro was attacked by Namorita. After being slammed into a bus, and continuously taunted by Namorita, he let off a massive explosion that killed the majority of The New Warriors, the children at a nearby elementary school, and the residents of the surrounding neighborhood. He escaped before the aftermath was picked up by various superhero teams, and is currently being hunted by Wolverine. In the wake of the tragedy, Capitol Hill proposed the Super Hero Act, requiring all costumed heroes to unmask themselves before the government and subject themselves to federally mandated standards.",

      "biography": "Jack Monroe was born on December 7, 1941, Pearl Harbor Day. His father was an American stateside Nazi sympathizer who filled his basement with a collection of Nazi paraphernalia. When Monroe brought some of this collection to school, he came to the attention of FBI agents who used Monroe to gather information about his father. When the FBI later arrested Monroe's father, it was discovered the entire town was somehow involved. Jack and his little sister were taken from his hometown and raised in various foster homes across the country, with Jack settling into Naugatuck, Connecticut.Monroe had long been an admirer of Captain America and his partner Bucky, an admiration that was fostered by the American government who hoped to groom Monroe into becoming a new Bucky for his generation. His foster parents were killed by Communist spies during the height of the Korean War, and after a brief time in the care of his alcoholic aunt, Monroe was placed in McMurtry's Foster Home and enrolled in Lee School for Boys in Connecticut. Monroe's history instructor shared his hero worship, and Monroe, who had since earned the nickname Bucky, became friends with his teacher through their mutual obsession. The government hoped that William Burnside (who changed his appearance and legal name to \"Steve Rogers\" to match that of the original Captain America), would become the next Captain America. After the Korean War, however, the government lost interest in this project, canceling its plans. So when a new villain calling himself the Red Skull appeared, Steve Rogers took it upon himself to inject himself and Jack with a variation of the Super-Soldier formula, becoming the new Captain America and Bucky. Together, the heroes battled the Communist Red Skull and, later, other foes of America such as the U.N.-bombing teen idol Chuck Blayne and the mechanical beasts of the Cult of the Green Dragon. Unfortunately, the Super-Soldier serum was only part of the Super-Soldier program, and without treatment from \"vita-rays,\" Rogers' variation of the serum began to effect the heroes' sanity. They began preying upon those they suspected of being Communists. When the government learned of their indiscretions, FBI agents captured them, placing them in suspended animation in the hopes that someday they could be restored. They were released when a disgruntled government employee sympathized with the two's hard-line stance on suspected Communists. The second Captain America and Bucky believed that the original Captain America was a fake, and they fought him and his partner the Falcon. When they were defeated, they were sent back into suspended animation.Doctor Faustus, a psychologist, managed to gain custody of the two, transferring them to his mental institution which was actually a front for the criminal organization known as the Corporation. Dr. Faustus wanted to use them as test subjects for his mind-controlling gas. Faustus transformed William Burnside into the Grand Director of the fascist National Force and, as a test of loyalty, ordered him to shoot his former partner. The Grand Director did so, and although the gun was not loaded, was led to believe he killed Jack. The Grand Director and Faustus were defeated by Captain America and Daredevil as they brought down the National Force, and Jack Monroe was placed in the custody of S.H.I.E.L.D., where he was given special treatments to restore his sanity.Rehabilitated, S.H.I.E.L.D. made Jack into Nomad, an identity once used by the original Captain America when he was briefly divorced from the American government and wanted an identity which did not have patriotic symbolism. They gave him a mission to infiltrate the headquarters of the Viper, hoping that the Nomad suit would unnerve the Viper since the original Nomad had defeated her once before. Nomad helped Captain America thwart the Viper's scheme, and Monroe decided to keep the identity of Nomad. He joined Captain America as a partner and apprentice, not knowing where else to go, but grateful for the friendship and tutelage in this new society.  During a period of time as a solo adventurer, he brought down the drug empire of the criminal Slug, but he soon returned to join Captain America, at the time calling himself simply the Captain, and his allies, Falcon and Demolition Man, to oppose the Commission on Super-Human Activities. Following in Captain America's footsteps left something to be desired for Monroe. He was on a trail of a drug dealer that the law couldn't touch, and he realized the complexities of good and evil. He rescued an infant from a woman who was a prostitute and a drug addict. Determined to find his own style of crimefighting, Jack re-invented his costume and repertoire. He took it upon himself to raise the little girl, whom he named \"Bucky.\" When bringing down the drug dealer, Monroe was confronted by the dealer, Captain America and agents of the Commission, and both the American and Russian militaries. Monroe escaped, forced to kill many of his opponents. He then started wandering across the United States and Canada, fulfilling the name Nomad.During his travels, Monroe joined with a network of con-artists, petty thieves and prostitutes known as the Undergrounders. Monroe settled down for a short time in Los Angeles, confronting a number of adversaries such as U.S.Agent, Deadpool, the Punisher and an evil doppelganger of the thief Gambit, during that period. He and Bucky began wandering once more after surviving an intense city-wide riot. As he traveled, Monroe was forced to confront the realities of the homeless, AIDS, gay rights and hate spawned by ignorance.One of Monroe's enemies, the criminal Giscard Epurer, had located Bucky's mother, molding her into a killing machine in hopes that she would defeat Monroe for the possession of her daughter. When the two finally battled, Monroe reluctantly conceded that she was capable of taking care of both herself and Bucky and left them to start their life together.After an attempt on his life, Monroe tracked down whom he believed the culprit, Epurer. In fact, it was a childhood bully of Monroe, Bart Ingrid, who had secretly revived the Nazi movement in their hometown and created a an underground militia camp. Epurer sent Monroe to neutralize the camp and rescue his covert operative, Bucky's mother. In the process, Monroe learned the truth about his parents and found his mother still alive. He finally confronted Ingrid's agent, the evil 88, who had killed Bucky's mother. By taking and reprogramming 88's gun, Monroe destroyed the camp and confronted Ingrid in Washington DC, where Ingrid hoped to topple America's government from the inside. Monroe killed Ingrid but set off the bomb Ingrid wanted to use to destroy the U.S. Senate. Monroe was believed to have died, and Bucky was taken in by Epurer, who felt responsible for the death of her mother and her erstwhile adopted father.In fact, Monroe did not die, but was once more placed in suspended animation by the U.S. government. Years later, Monroe was awakened by Henry Peter Gyrich, head of the Commission on Super-Human Activities. Gyrich outfitted Monroe with the costume and identity of Scourge in reminiscence of the agents of the organization Scourge of the Underworld, who would kill superhuman criminals. Monroe, as Scourge, was charged with the task to hunt down and eliminate the members of the team Thunderbolts, former supervillains who once posed as heroes to take over the world but later aimed to become champions. In the course of his task, Monroe killed the Thunderbolts' Jolt, Baron Zemo, and Techno. Before he died, Techno resurrected Jolt so that she would confront Monroe, who immediately began to battle the Thunderbolts' Atlas. Atlas' body was unstable, and he threatened to destroy the surrounding area. Monroe helped contain Atlas' destruction but in so doing appeared to have killed him as well.The Thunderbolts tracked down and defeated Scourge, revealing him to be Monroe. They discovered that Monroe was actually being controlled by nanotech, microscopic probes that controlled his actions but allowed him to be aware of his actions. With the limited amount of free will afforded to him, Monroe tried to hunt down those Thunderbolts that seemed either unredeemable or easily resurrected. Monroe revealed the truth about Gyrich, that he hoped to use the destructive power of the nanoprobes to wipe out all superhumans on Earth. Freed of the nanoprobes with help of the Thunderbolts, Monroe allied with the team to confront Gyrich and his own team of superhumans, the Redeemers. The Thunderbolts ultimately discovered that Gyrich himself was being controlled by the nanoprobes, and they freed everyone from the thrall of the nanotech. Monroe, using the holographic disguise in his Scourge arsenal, disappeared during the denouement to once again wander the roads.More recently, although he tried to continue being a crimefighter, the action left him weaker and weaker. Jack discovered that the Super-Soldier serum was finally and irrevocably breaking down and would eventually kill him. In the last stages of this process, as he grew physically weak, so did he mentally, often experiencing hallucinations and revisiting old memories. He checked up on the young infant he briefly raised, he found her living well and adopted into a family in Philadelphia as Julia Winter. Even so, Jack stumbled across a drug dealer around her school, and he took it upon himself to take down the drug ring, even if it meant it would be his last adventure. He fought what he thought were gangs and drug runners, but in fact, his insanity twisted his perception. His enemies were innocent bystanders, the initial drug pusher really an ice cream vendor. When exiting a bar one night, Jack was shot point-blank in the chest, a victim of the Winter Soldier who was hunting all those ever imbued with the Super-Soldier serum. It was later revealed that Winter Soldier was infact James Barnes the original Bucky who was brainwashed by the Soviet Union and used as an assassin after the World War II.",

      "biography": "Jean-Paul Beaubier’s parents were killed in a car crash shortly after his birth. He and his twin sister Jeanne-Marie were taken in by the Martins, cousins of their mother, but they could not afford to raise both children and so sent Jeanne-Marie to a catholic girl’s school. When Jean-Paul was six, he was placed in a foster home after his foster parents died, and the twins grew up unaware of each other. As a teenager, Jean-Paul was caught stealing by Raymonde Belmonde, who became his mentor and guardian, helping Jean-Paul cope with both his emerging mutant nature and his sexuality. Belmonde introduced Jean-Paul to skiing, which he used as a means to help control his super-speed. Jean-Paul later joined a circus and became a talented trapeze artist. He came to regard his fellow performers as the family he had never known. However, there was still much anger and frustration within him which he ultimately expressed by joining the separatist Front de Libération du Québec movement. Becoming part of the Front’s radical Cell Combattre, Jean-Paul acted as a courier. He came to disagree with the Cell’s terrorist methods after he saw himself forced to save innocent lives from a bomb. He subsequently severed all ties with the Front.\nJean-Paul returned to his passion for skiing, and by secretly using his powers he quickly became a world champion, winning a gold medal at the Olympics and becoming famous and wealthy. At that time, the Canadian government’s Department H had begun forming a team of superhuman operatives, Alpha Flight. The team’s founder, James Hudson, had already recruited Jean-Paul’s sister as Aurora, and after seeing a photo of Jean-Paul he noticed their resemblance and discovered they were siblings. Hudson invited Jean-Paul to join the team as well, and he was overjoyed to learn that he had a sister, joining the team as Northstar to be with her. The twin’s reunion came as a surprise to all, for when they touched they created a flash of intense light. The team’s first mission was to reclaim former government operative Wolverine, who had defected and joined the American X-Men team. Ambushing the X-Men in Calgary, Alpha Flight held their own, but the battle caused much damage and the government opted to let Wolverine go rather than face massive rebuilding costs. Shortly thereafter, Department H was closed and Alpha Flight disbanded. Later visiting his sister, Northstar was shocked to discover that she had a dual personality, alternating between the free-spirited Aurora and the shy, reserved Jeanne-Marie. When Hudson reformed Alpha Flight without government funding, Northstar managed to convince his sister to return with him. After his sister began to switch personalities with increasing frequency, Northstar sought psychiatric help for her.Later, Northstar took his sister to visit Belmonde, but the reunion turned to tragedy after Belmonde was killed by Deadly Ernest who then kidnapped Aurora. With the help of the enigmatic Nemesis, Northstar rescued his sister. The siblings later argued over Northstar’s mistaken assumption that Aurora had romanced Ernest to prevent him from harming her. Shocked at her brother’s arrogance, Aurora angrily told him she never wanted to see him again. Despite Northstar’s pleas for forgiveness, Aurora stayed true to her word, and he eventually ceased operating as a member of Alpha Flight on a regular basis. Aurora ultimately sought to break her ties with him completely by having her teammate and then-lover Sasquatch alter her powers so they were not the same as his. Ultimately reconciling their differences following the apparent death of Sasquatch, the twins joined Alpha Flight in opposing the gamma-spawned Hulk, who was rampaging through Vancouver. During the battle, the twins discovered that, as a result of Aurora’s altered powers, they could now no longer touch each other without temporarily canceling out their powers. The Hulk was eventually driven back to the U.S., and the Canadian government realized that Alpha Flight was necessary and reinstated the team’s funding. Northstar returned to active status with the team, but his terrorist past would soon come back to haunt him after former members of Cell Combattre began turning up dead. After the killer was exposed, Northstar was pardoned for his past indiscretions by Canada’s Prime Minister.Shortly thereafter, Northstar grew ill until he became almost completely incapacitated. While Alpha Flight sought a cure, the Norse trickster god Loki appeared to the twins, convincing them that they were not mutants but the children of an Asgardian elf, and that Northstar was dying because he could not exist without his light. Aurora willingly expended her power to bathe Northstar in her light, curing him. She was then captured by demons and became trapped in the Asgardian netherworld, while Northstar was welcomed into the realm of Asgard by his supposed brethren. Loki was summoned before the higher gods, They Who Sit Above in Shadow, and berated for his actions. In attempted atonement, he transported Aurora to a monastery on Earth, but was sent to the netherworld himself as punishment. Northstar remained in Asgard until his former teammates rescued him from being slain by Dark Elves worshipping Llan the Sorceror, and during the ensuing battle against Llan he was able to restore Aurora’s powers. As a side effect, both siblings proved able to generate light individually. After discovering an abandoned baby girl who had been born with the AIDS virus, Northstar adopted her, naming her Joanne, but she died weeks later. Northstar then publicly announced his homosexuality, hoping that his celebrity status would increase interest in HIV prevention. Following another disbanding of Alpha Flight, Northstar was implicated in the murder of a tabloid reporter, and the Canadian government dispatched Department K’s Weapon P.R.I.M.E. unit to bring him in. At the same time, Northstar was targeted by the manic assassin Arcade, who had been employed by Carl Kerridge, a businessman who sought to cleanse the human race of supposed impurities. Northstar was able to gather enough evidence to prove his innocence and convict Kerridge.Northstar later reunited with his former teammates to uncover the truth about the new Department H, and they assisted a new Alpha Flight team against the latest Weapon X. Northstar then left to write his autobiography, “Born Normal.” At a book signing in Philadelphia, Northstar was recruited by the mutant telepath Jean Grey to join an ad-hoc X-Men team to oppose Magneto and his planned all-out attack against mankind. Returning to Canada, Northstar established himself as a successful businessman before he was invited to join the Xavier Institute as a teacher of business and economics. Northstar also taught a flight class for new students, and became advisor to a squad of students he dubbed Alpha Squadron in honor of his former team. After his teammate Wolverine was captured and brainwashed by the terrorist organization Hydra, Northstar was killed in an ambush by Wolverine. He was subsequently resurrected and brainwashed into leading Hydra’s super-powered army in an attack on the Helicarrier headquarters of their nemesis S.H.I.E.L.D. Meanwhile, Wolverine had been deprogrammed by S.H.I.E.L.D. and aided in the defense of the Helicarrier, but was unable to prevent Northstar from seriously injuring S.H.I.E.L.D.’s leader Nick Fury. Northstar then led the army on a killing spree, murdering anti-mutant and anti-gay supporters until he was confronted by Wolverine. Capturing him, Northstar tortured him until a group of giant mutant-hunting robot Sentinels under S.H.I.E.L.D. control intervened. As the Sentinels killed the other super-beings, Wolverine was able to defeat Northstar, and he was taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody to be deprogrammed.",

      "biography": "Randomly chosen to become a member of the Nova Corps until the Annihilation Wave destroyed them all, leaving him imbued with their combined power and guided by the super-intelligent Worldmind computer, Richard Rider wages a one-man battle for justice as Nova.  Enlisted Into the Corps Chosen at random by the dying Xandarian Rhomann Dey to receive his Nova Corps powers, teenager Richard Rider found himself thrust into the role of superhero, a role he grasped with relish. He battled foes such as Dey's nemesis Zorr, the avian criminal Condor, the amnesiac Powerhouse (actually a Xandarian sent to locate the missing Dey), his uncle's murderer and member of the Maggia, Photon, and the mysterious Sphinx. The latter eventually kidnapped Nova and several others, using Dey's spaceship to transport them all to Xandar. Learning that Xandar was threatened by the Skrull Empire, Nova and his fellows (bar the Sphinx, who had returned to Earth, and Doctor Sun, who teleported to an unknown location) pledged their aid; the Skrulls were eventually driven off with the help of the Galadorian Spaceknight, Rom. Homesick for Earth, Richard agreed to give up his powers, which were needed to help rebuild war-ravaged Xandar's defenses, and returned home a normal human once more, or so it seemed. New Warrior to Reality Star \nMonths later Richard was tracked down by Night Thrasher, who believed Richard's powers were merely dormant and wished to recruit Nova for his prospective hero team. To test the theory, Night Thrasher dropped Richard off a roof; luckily for both of them, Night Thrasher was correct, and the adrenaline rush reawoke Richard's abilities. Alongside several other teenage heroes he founded the New Warriors, and also resumed his solo career. He fought alongside the New Warriors for years, including encounters with Nova's old foe the Sphinx and a brief stint during which the Warriors worked with Cable and X-Force. He was eventually hunted down by Super-Nova, the Xandarian who held the rest of the Nova-Force inside his body and had been driven mad by it.  The two of them, aided by the New Warriors and Galactus' Xandarian heralds Firelord and Air-Walker, ended up setting off protocols that led to Xandar's resurrection.  The StarCorps was reinstated, and Rider was appointed Centurion Prime and assigned to guard earth's sector of space.Returning to Earth, Rider was confronted with dual lives as Centurion Prime and a member of the New Warriors. He also encountered another Nova from an alternate timeline named Nova 0:0. Nova 0:0 attacked Rider to prepare him for defending his Earth from the force that had destroyed Nova 0:0's Earth, the Deathstorm. After stopping the Deathstorm and saving Earth, Rider was replaced as Centurion Prime for Earth's sector of space by Garthan Saal, the former Super-Nova, after failing to follow orders at a crucial time. When Saal sacrificed himself to save earth from the Dire Wraith queen Volx, he passed his powers back to Rider.  He continued to fight alongside the New Warriors until the team broke up, reformed, and broke up again.  He agreed to come back as part of the New Warriors reality TV show, and travelled the U.S. with the team, fighting menaces that'd taken up residence in communities that didn't have resident heroes.   Annihilated The team fought several criminals who'd escaped the Raft during the massive prison break that led to the reestablishing of the Avengers, before being recalled to Xandar alongside the rest of the Nova Corps to deal with the threat of the Annihilation Wave.  Rider was the only StarCorps member to survive the Wave's surprise attack, and has become the bearer of the entire Nova-Force, as well as the Xandarian Worldmind, the living computers that contain the entire record of Xandarian civilization as well as the minds of all its deceased members.Nova then came into contact with Drax who taught him how to better control the Nova Force and how to kill. Realizing his new leadership abilities, Nova created the United Front, an army opposed to Annihilus. Several beings joined the United Front alongside Nova including Silver Surfer, Ronan, Gamora, Phyla-Vell, Moondragon, the Spaceknights, Blastaar, Stardust, Firelord, Red Shift, Super-Skrull, Star-Lord, and others. Alongside these beings Nova was able to squash Annihilus's forces and kill Annihilus. Force of One After the war, Richard started to scan the galaxy, searching for beings who needed help. Continuing this for an undetermined amount of time he became fatigued and homesick. The Worldmind advised Richard to return to Earth to rest. Taking Worldmind's advice Richard returned to Earth to find the state of the world after the Civil War. While back home Richard was approached by Iron Man, who strongly urged Richard to register. Stark then sent Justice to try and convince him to register. Failing to see the point to any of the madness Richard left Earth and returned to his Nova duties. Infected by the Phalanx When the Phalanx took control of Kree Space and infected many worlds, Nova found himself trapped inside Kree Space and crashed into an energy barrier, landing on a Kree outpost severely damaged. There Commander Ko-Rel opposed a horde of Phalanx while protecting Nova from an infected Gamora. Nova was too weak to fight back, so the Worldmind uploaded some of the Nova Force into Ko-Rel turning her into a Nova Corps member. Gamora then slipped past the Kree defenses and infected Richard with the techno-organic virus, turning him into a Phalanx Select. Gamora and Nova left the outpost and returned to Hala.Ko-Rel pursued Nova but was unable to defeat him and was killed. After her death the power she possessed returned to Nova, enabling him to resist the transmode virus. Now on the run from other Phalanx Select, he soon found himself at the edge of the universe in a place called Knowhere where he was attacked by zombies under the control of an unknown evil called Abyss. However, after making an ally in a talking dog named Cosmo, Nova defeated the villain and restored peace to Knowhere. Cosmo then used the resources at his disposal to chart Nova a course for the birthplace of the Phalanx, Kvch, in hopes that Nova could find a way to cure himself of the virus that was slowly killing him. Nova's journey was temporarily interrupted when a creature called a Vore tried to feed him to its unborn young.Nova made it to Kvch, as did Gamora and Drax, where he met Warlock, of the New Mutants. Warlock was trying to put an end to his race's murderous ways, starting with his new charge, Tyro. While on Kvch, a technarchy monster was coming to challenge Tyro for his right to live, and Warlock knew that even the combined powers of the three individuals would not be able to stop it. The only solution was for Tyro to flee, and in order to give Tyro the necessary time to escape, Warlock sacrificed himself and used his life energies to cure Nova, who in turn fought the monster despite the fact he would probably not survive. Tyro returned and defeated his would-be killer by taking over his body and asserting his consciousness over the creature. With the danger passed, Tyro gave some of the enormous life energies he now possessed to revive his adoptive parent, Warlock, as well as Gamora and Drax. Now free of the transmode virus, the group returned to Hala and helped put an end to the Phalanx invasion. Encounter with Galactus Nova assisted the citizens of the world Orbucen in a planet-wide evacuation when Galactus decided Orbucen would be his next meal. Nova ran into two problems during the mass departure: the first was the herald of Galactus, the Silver Surfer, and the other was a homicidal entity called Harrow. Harrow proved to be the bigger menace because he preyed on the inhabitants of Orbucen as they struggled to survive the threat of the world devourer. Nova was almost killed trying to apprehend the telepathic intruder, but he escaped onto Galactus' ship. There, Nova found Harrow's primary body, hiding from Galactus' attention, and engaged the parasite in battle. Eventually, the Silver Surfer intervened, determined Harrow was nothing but vermin, and alerted his master to the alien being's presence. Harrow attempted to escape, but Galactus incinerated him on sight. Nova thought he would share Harrow's fate, but Galactus teleported him to safety. The Silver Surfer warned Nova to stay away from his master because Galactus never spares anything twice. Reestablish the Nova Corps Nova learned of the Skrull Invasion on Earth and traveled there along with the Super-Skrull who pretended to betray Nova in order to keep him alive. Nova responded to a distress call from the scientists in Project PEGASUS, and helped Darkhawk and a newly revived Quasar fight off a squad of super Skrulls. The Worldmind, thought to be lost after Nova's run-in with Harrow, was reactivated and tapped into the Project's mainframe to activate the Death's Head Guards as back-up troops. However, all seemed lost when a Skrull battle cruiser was about to fire on the installation, but an unexpected emergence of a new Nova Corps destroyed the battleship and saved the day. Worldmind went behind Nova's back to form a new Corps and continued to endow individuals with power, including his brother Robbie, against Nova's wishes. Nova was almost ready to submit to Worldmind's plans, but once he was informed Ego, the Living Planet was chosen to be Nu-Xandar, Nova would not voluntarily download the majority of the Nova Force into Ego. The Worldmind concluded Nova had become mentally unstable from holding that much power for such a long period of time, so it forcibly took Nova's powers from him. Nova was then transported back to Earth.   Protector of the Universe Once a normal human again, Nova discovered he was dying because of the absence of the Nova Force. In addition, he discovered Worldmind was using subliminal control over those he was recruiting into the Corps. Nova couldn't even turn to those at Project PEGASUS for help since Norman Osborn's H.A.M.M.E.R. took over. However, there was a scientist on the inside, secretly working for A.I.M., that wanted to help him. She took Nova to a hidden lab, and using a stolen canister filled with Quantum energy, attempted to cure him. He appreciated the gesture, but he destroyed the canister, allowing the energy to be free. Quasar appeared with the Quantum Bands and offered them to Nova to save his life. Nova accepted, and for a brief time, became the new Protector of the Universe. Nova and Quasar journeyed to Nu-Xandar where they confronted Worldmind and Ego even as the Nova Corps were locked in battle against Shi'ar forces. Ego was gaining control over Worldmind and manipulated many of the individuals in the Corps to attack Nova, but Nova channeled a huge blast of energy to lobotomize Ego. With Ego unable to access his higher brain functions, Worldmind came back online, but switched to a new persona to interact with Nova, knowing its programming was corrupted. Nova regained his powers and returned the Quantum Bands back to their rightful owner.  Back With A Vengeance Inexperienced Nova Corps dealing with hardened Shi'ar soldiers posed a serious problem but a newly restored Nova immediately flew into battle to rescue as many recruits as he could. Upon finding out his brother, Robbie, was missing, he took a small force to Robbie’s last known coordinates only to be attacked by Triton of the Inhumans and his forces. Trying to avoid a fight at all costs, Nova was spared from retaliating when a former comrade, Ra-Venn, recognized him. Nova was then taken to the site where the soldiers of the cruel emperor Vulcan exterminated a countless amount of Nova Corps recruits - execution style. All that remained were their helmets. A disheartened Nova did not falter from his mission to save his brother even after seeing what was left of the fallen Centurions. Battling his way through the forces of Ravenous, Nova heard his brother's agonizing scream and feared the worst. Charging headfirst into what could have been his last battle, Nova confronted the immensely powerful Xenith and decisively defeated her, saving both the lives of Ravenous and his brother.  What Lurks Inside the Fault? After the war ended, it left the universe in more danger than ever with the creation of The Fault – a tear in space caused by a devastating weapon made by the Inhumans with the intention of obliterating the Shi'ar race. A Nova Corps starship, the Resolute Duty, which had been missing for thirty-five years, had suddenly resurfaced bringing with it a slew of new problems for the Corps. Nova Centurian, Zan Philo, still captained the ship and had a dangerous prisoner on board. A deadly bounty hunter known as Monark Starstalker stowed away only to attempt to wrestle the prisoner away from Centurion Philo, so he could collect the price on his head. A catastrophic attack to Worldmind by Starstalker gave Ego the opening it needed to assert itself over the Xandarian supercomputer, and the criminal held in captivity was about to be liberated by beings who followed him, the merciless Mindless Ones. The Mindless Ones cut the main power to Philo's ship and freed their master, but Philo worked to get power restored as Worldmind downloaded itself into the Resolute Duty. With Worldmind and Starstalker's help, Nova transported the Mindless Ones along with their leader into Ego's brain, giving the Living Planet a more immediate threat to contend with than the Nova Corps. The danger having passed, Starstalker left to roam the universe, and Philo agreed to become a Drill Sergeant to train the rookies. A Tale of Two Sphinxes  Escaping the perils of the Fault once did not mean Nova was free from its evil influence. While on a mission to find Darkhawk for allegedly killing Lilandra Neramani, Nova found him on a dying planet. Darkhawk refused to be imprisoned for a crime he did not commit and fled, but Nova gave chase. In the midst of his pursuit, the planet exploded and both heroes were believed dead. In actuality, Nova and Darkhawk were ripped from their world and brought to a magically constructed creation of one of Nova's deadliest foes - the Sphinx. Other familiar faces such as Reed Richards and Namorita were also brought to this makeshift world for the purpose of helping the Sphinx defeat his younger self. The Sphinx of the past wanted to possess two Ka Stones, which was previously thought impossible to do, but within the Fault anything was possible. Both brought his own avatars achieve his goal, pitting them against each other, during which it was discovered the older version was dying. Darkhawk was the deciding factor for the older Sphinx's victory, but he was also the one hero that could be manipulated into giving the Sphinx what he wanted too. Either getting the idea from his younger self, or intending on the same thing all along, Sphinx forced Darkhawk to procure the second Ka Stone and surrender it to him. Now with the immense power of both stones, the Sphinx was restored and became a god. He literally devoured his younger self and cast the heroes aside as they were no more to him than dust motes. While learning to deal with the power of both Ka Stones, the Sphinx was finding a way to have the real world accept the impossibility of two stones existing at the same time. He would have succeeded if not for the power of Nova coupled with the calculating mind of Richards. Together, they figured out a way to expel the Sphinx from his imaginary world into actual reality before he adapted, and in doing so, the Sphinx ceased to exist. With the Sphinx gone, his creation fell apart, and all who were brought there would be returned to the past. Nova couldn't bear the thought of losing Namorita again, so he embraced her one last time, not realizing he would pull her from the Fault into her future. Darkhawk told Nova this decision would end badly but Nova didn't care just then. Secret Avenger Nova temporarily returned to Earth when Steve Rogers asked him to become a part of his Secret Avengers. Nova accepted and was dispatched to Mars to after a second Serpent Crown was discovered on Earth, but he went missing soon after arriving. Nova found the actual Serpent Crown and became entranced after swapping it for his Nova helmet. The Secret Avengers pursued Nova but were not able to subdue him until Rogers put on the Nova helmet, receiving Nova's abilities. Once the Serpent Crown was removed from his head, Nova returned to normal. After heading home, Nova responded to a bank robbery and stopped a gang of intergalactic thieves along with Spider-Man.  Thanos and the Cancerverse \n Once again in Project PEGASUS, Nova was faced with a doppelganger Quasar from a twisted reality dubbed the Cancerverse within the Fault who attempted to assist his brethren in invading the \"prime reality\"  through a gateway found in the institution. Nova shut down the gateway and pursued the fake Quasar into space where a massive war was already in progress between the forces of the \"prime reality\" and that of the Cancerverse. The mad titan Thanos had been previously resurrected and was thought to be the only hope to defeat the Cancerverse, so he and the Guardians of the Galaxy went into the Fault to find a way to defeat the invading reality. Nova soon followed after rescuing a kidnapped Namorita from the Revengers – a distorted version of the Avengers. He assisted Star-Lord in detaining an enraged Thanos from escaping back into the \"prime reality\" with the intention of destroying everything after Mistress Death again rejected him, even after Thanos eradicated an entire reality for her. Nova remained with Star-Lord until the Cancerverse imploded and the Fault was sealed in the process, seemingly killing them all.",

      "biography": "When the space pirate Nebula destroyed the planet Xandar, its World-Mind transferred the deceased Nova Corps’ collective Nova-Force into their sole survivor, Garthan Saal, to safeguard the energies and distribute them to worthy successors of Xandar’s noble tradition. Saal was transformed into the immensely powerful Super-Nova, but the energies drove him mad. Seeking vengeance on Nebula, Saal beat the similarly searching Starfox and Firelord (a fellow Xandarian) when they could not deliver her. Saal learned that Nebula was involved with Earth’s Avengers – though neither Saal nor the Avengers realized this was Ravonna, the future Terminatrix, impersonating Nebula – and he prepared to destroy Earth unless he received Nebula. Saal withstood the combined assaults of Quasar, the Fantastic Four, and the Avengers, but Reed Richards convinced him to enter the timestream to pursue the timelost Nebula.His search fruitless, Saal watched with rage as the human Richard Rider regained his Nova-Power. Saal returned to Earth, and the coming together of all portions of the Nova-Force in the universe activated a failsafe in the World-Mind, cloning Xandar’s Queen Adora. Saal defeated Nova (Rider) and forced him to surrender his power, then learned that Rider was also imbued with Xandar’s spirit. He combined his power with Rider to restore Xandar, but Rider absorbed Saal’s power instead. Saal fell comatose while Rider restored Xandar’s World-Mind and was instated as Nova Centurion Prime. Recovering, Saal was made Centurion Sector Coordinator, but after Rider refused an order to assist the reformed Nova Corps (a.k.a. StarCorp), Adora – apparently pressured by Shi’ar representatives – sent Saal, as Nova Omega, to strip Rider of rank and power. Rider fled to Adora to learn the truth, and she confirmed Saal’s replacing him as Centurion Prime. Saal accompanied Rider to Earth, but their pilot revealed himself to be Volx the Dire Wraith Queen. The ship crashed on Earth, and Volx escaped when Rider spitefully shot Saal with a blaster. Volx captured the pursuing Saal and drained his energy to power a doomsday weapon, but Rider and the New Warriors freed Saal, who joined Rider in exploding Volx’s base.Stationed in Earth’s orbit, Saal enjoyed his new mission, becoming a local hero in San Francisco and remotely communicating with old friend Mexxa Rien. After assisting the Warriors against the Sphinx and preventing a disastrous radiation release, Saal learned his superiors were spying on Earth. Cutting their connection, Saal helped the Warriors locate Volx, who was arranging to remove Earth’s superhumans’ powers. Volx seemed unbeatable until Saal tried to drain her power. The vast energies mortally wounded Saal, but this left Volx weakened. Dying, Saal returned Rider’s power and informed him of Xandar’s treachery. The Warriors slew Volx, and Saal’s brain patterns were presumably transferred to the World-Mind, living on in Richard Rider to this day.",

Give him a blue.\n\nA Highly Trained and Merciless Killer &lt;?h4&gt;\n\nFrank Charles Simpson is a savage fighter from Dayton, Ohio. He is the child of an abusive, alcoholic mother who came from a wealthy family, and a father, Charles Simpson, who was a decent man, but broken by his hateful wife.\n\nFrank’s problematic behavior in school caught the interest of a secret organization led by the ancient and manipulative Romulus. Sending an agent named Betsy to work for the Simpsons as Frank’s babysitter, the organization hoped to mold him in their image. Through Betsy’s kindness, she became a mother figure for Frank.

Also known as the All-Father, King Odin raised a son named Thor with whom he defends their godly realm against threats planetary, cosmic, and sometimes even familial.\n\nMonarch of Asgard\n\nOdin’s grandfather Buri is thought to be the first Asgardian god. His son Bor with his wife giantess Bestia thus had three children—Odin and his brothers Vili and Ve.

Odin allegedly helped create humanity, a controversial move which Bor disapproved. Odin, Vili, and Ve assumed rule over their lands and bested Ymir the Frost Giant, allegedly constructing the cosmos from Ymir’s corpse. Together, the three brothers established the city and realm of Asgard, which became the home of the gods.\n\nAs the trio set out to explore their surroundings, they came upon Muspelheim, land of Surtur the fire demon. Surtur was forging his sword Twilight, which could bring about the destruction of Asgard and Earth. The three brothers combined their power to transform into a single immense warrior and destroyed Twilight in combat. Escaping, Odin stole the Eternal Flame of Destruction which was needed to reforge Twilight, but Vili and Ve remained behind to hold back Surtur and seemingly perished at Surtur’s hands. With his brothers’ deaths, Odin received their godly energies; his enhanced might was called the “Odinpower.”",

      "biography": "The complete history and origin of the man known as the Ogre remains to be revealed. His first known activity occurred early in the history of the X-Men, when Ogre was hired by the secret cabal known as Factor Three. Ogre (alongside a coerced hero, Banshee) was sent to capture the X-Men leader, Cyclops. When Ogre failed but escaped capture, he was instructed by Factor Three to return to one of their many hideaways-- at Mt. Charteris, Colorado.The young mutant Sonny Baredo was then kidnapped by the villain team Factor Three and brought him to their headquarters in order to experiment on the extent and nature of his powers. Ogre spent the next few years studying Baredo as his powers developed to greater levels. When Baredo's full powers emerged at age eighteen, Ogre determined he was too dangerous to try to control. He placed him in cryogenic state and vowed to protect the boy in the hopes of redeeming his role in exacerbating his powers.Much later, Factor Three reorganized and returned to their hideaway to find the Ogre still waiting for them. Ogre helped them with the details of daily life, and when Factor Three left to implement their latest plan, ordered Ogre to stay behind. However, Factor Three was defeated and never returned.Ogre was forgotten. Ogre and Humus Sapien, as Baredo was referred to, remained in Factor Three's hideaway and remained hidden as other villainous teams took over the base for their own purposes, among them the racist Sons of the Serpent, the terrorists Hydra, a private army of madman August Masters, and the Masters of Evil. Ogre tried to make contact at various times, only to be fired upon, so he returned to hiding. Often, Ogre would take advantage of the machinery and complex systems around him to increase his knowledge of technology.When the heroic Thunderbolts infiltrated the base to confront the Masters of Evil, the Ogre surreptitiously aided the heroes. The Ogre remained a hidden benefactor for the Thunderbolts when they appropriated the base after the Masters' defeat. The Thunderbolts finally confronted Ogre, and offered him a place by their side. Elated by his new-found role, Orge was accosted by the ex-Thunderbolt and villainous Techno. Techno assumed Ogre's identity and placed him in cryogenic storage.Techno remained disguised as Ogre for many weeks, unbeknownst to the other Thunderbolts, until he was killed by the Thunderbolt's assassin, Scourge (secretly a government-controlled Nomad. Ogre was thus reawakened, and, finally deeming the headquarters too dangerous to risk Baredo's discovery, he fled into a hidden pocket dimension with Baredo's comatose body.However, Techno's human counterpart, the Fixer (now a part of the team known as Redeemers), was researching Techno's activities, and stumbled across Ogre's tesseract dimension. In so doing, Fixer brought them both to Earth once more, freeing Baredo from his cryogenic storage in the process. Baredo's powers flared up, and his sympathy for the Earth led him to seek revenge on humankind. Ultimately, however, Baredo realized what his powers were doing to other people, and he returned to the Ogre and the Redeemers. The two teams hoped to open a stargate that would transport Baredo off-planet where his link to Earth would cease to cause harm. Baredo used his own power to fuel the stargate, and before he could disappear, Ogre jumped into the stargate with him, hoping to somehow make up for his past wrongs by staying alongside Humus Sapien.",

      "biography": "The Collective is the unified energy signatures of all the mutants depowered after House of M|\"M-Day\". It is unknown whether or not the Collective was sentient after it united, or whether certain energies were sentient and they ruled over the others, but what is known is that the power hurled towards the Earth as one and landed in a city in Alaska, obliterating the town of North Pole.The Collective bonded to a mailman named Michael Pointer and set off through Canada towards the United States, seemingly killing the Canadian super-team Alpha Flight when they opposed him. He was confronted by the Avengers, who managed to calm him down. Ms. Marvel, unaware of the developments, interrupted the situation and attacked the Collective. After battling Ms. Marvel, the Collective was driven into space by the Sentry, during which time Spider-Man discovered the Collective's true nature. When Iron Man and the Sentry let the Collective be, he made his way to Genosha.Once The Collective reached Genosha, he went after Magneto in an attempt to give him back the powers he had lost after House of M. The Collective took control of Magneto's body and a battle ensued between Magneto and the Avengers. At this point it was revealed that The Collective itself had been controlled by Xorn the whole time and Michael Pointer was released froms Xorn's control when The Collective was passed on to Magneto. Pointer was then sent to a maximum security facility.Recently the United States government had recreated a new Omega Flight team to help with the recent migration of criminals and unlicensed heroes to Canada due to the Civil War|Superhuman Registration Act. Seeing Michael as an excellent recruit Agent Jeff Brown of C.S.I.S inducted him into the new Omega Flight program as the new Guardian. After Norman Osborn rose to power following the Skrull invasion and decided to tackle the \"mutant problem\" head on, he assembled a group of mutants to act as his version of the X-Men. Pointer was tricked onto the team, but once there, Dark Beast created a device to feed Pointer mutant powers to keep his siphoning abilities in check. Pointer started to become like an addict, craving more and more power. Some of the X-Men (Osborn's team) were there under false pretenses, and when the time was right they revolted against Osborn, leaving the group. Pointer was not one of these individuals and stayed.",

      "biography": "During the late 1950's or early 1960's, Arkady Gregorivich Rossovich served in the USSR's Spetsnaz (border patrol commandos), secretly raping &amp; murdering young girls whenever the opportunity presented itself.  While assigned to a remote Siberian town, Rossovich's crimes were discovered, &amp; his fellow soldiers attempted to execute him via a gunshot to the head.  His mutant nature allowed him to survive the wound, &amp;, after a formal court-martial, he was drafted into the USSR's super-soldier project, undergoing various torturous enhancements, which, among other effects, turned his skin chalk-white.  By 1968, Rossovich, now dubbed Omega Red, was stationed in Berlin, East Germany, where the USSR transformed him into a cyborg via implanted retractable tentacles of radioactive Carbonadium (a less durable but more malleable imitation of Adamantium), created by a Carbonadium Synthesizer, or \"C-Synth.\"  However, before his transformation was complete, the C-Synth, needed to stabilize the interface between his mutant powers &amp; his bionic implants, was stolen by Team X members Wolverine (Logan/James Howlett), Sabertooth, &amp; Maverick (Christoph Nord).  Eventually Wolverine hid the C-Synth in the grave of Janice Hollenbeck, a double agent slain by Omega Red.Despite the C-Synth's theft, the USSR continued employing Omega Red as a super-operative in the KGB (Komitjet Gosudarstvjennoj Bjezopasnosti/Committee for State Security), using him against, among others, friends &amp; family of the mutant Katu Kath, whose powers disrupted Soviet satellite transmissions.  Without additional Carbonadium poisoning or death by his own spores; he was thus required to drain life force from any available victims to survive.  Although a murderer many times over, Red hated being unable to select his victim &amp; kill them at leisure as he had while a serial killer.  At some point he was, at least in his estimation, betrayed by fellow KGB agent Olinka Barankova.  Eventually, he escaped custody &amp; partially reverted to his pre-mutated appearance.  He committed several murders throughout Europe before Interpol agent Sean Cassidy (later Banshee), assisted by \"Eric Lehnsherr\" (Max Eisenhardt, later Magneto), tracked him to Ireland.  Aware that the Russian government would experiment on him further if captured, Red invited Cassidy to kill him; when Cassidy refused, red unleashed death spores upon Cassidy's associate, Inspector Magrite Deveraux, who fell to her death despite Cassidy's efforts.  Enraged, Cassidy shot Red several times, disabling , but not killing him.  Red was returned to Russian custody, his crimes concealed by government deceptions, but his continued inability to fully contain his death spores ultimately led his andlers to place him in suspended animation.In recent years, Japanese criminal Matsuo Tsurayaba, hired by the Fenris twins (Andrea &amp; Andreas Strucker), used 20 Hand ninjas to sacrifice themselves &amp; mystically revive Omega Red.  Fenris sent Red after the X-Men, &amp; he captured several, including Wolverine, a victory the twins hoped would cement their place in the power-seeking Upstarts cabal.  Eager for revenge on the former Team X member, Red battled Wolverine for hours, ultimately weakening him enough to be contained &amp; mind-probed.  Matsuo, per his bargain with Red, searched Wolverine's memories for information on the C-Synth, which Red still sought to remove his vampiric need for life force.  Maverick, having learned of these developments, penetrated Fenris' base, &amp; when Wolverine escaped, joined forces with him.  Following a battle with the freed X-Men, Red retreated, Wolverine &amp; Maverick subsequently prevented Matsuo from recovering the C-Synth, &amp; Wolverine entrusted its safety to Maverick.Weeks later, Omega Red resurfaced in Russia, where fellow mutant Soul Skinner, seeking revenge against the government, mentally enslaved him along with several inhabitants of the town Neftelensk.  Coincidentally, the X-Men also arrived in Russia seeking their associate Magik (Illyana Rasputin), imprisoned by a government faction.  Under Soul Skinner's control, Red fought the X-Men, but when Skinner was apparently slain by Colonel Alexi Vazhin, Red departed, seeing no benefit in continued conflict.  Evidently having acquired secret data while in Russia, Red searched for Olinka Barankova, whom he believed had been transformed into telepathic mutate MODAM.  His search led him to AIM, where he interrupted a battle between Iron Man (Tony Stark) &amp; MODAM, who had no memories of their supposed shared past.  Iron Man defeated both combatants.Relocating to England, Omega Red resumed his serial killer habits until Magneto's Acolytes, including Red's former victim, Katu, offered a cure his life-force addiction in exchange for joining their cause.  After acquiring the necessary information, Red betrayed the Acolytes &amp; gathered the cure's components on his own, battling Cable (Nathan Christopher Charles Summers aka Nathan Dayspring Askani'son) in the process.  At the Acolytes' Arctic base, Red prepared for his transformation, not caring that the procedure would unleash his body's death spores across Earth, but Katu teleported Red &amp; himself away, ending the treatment.  Resurfacing in Ireland, Red targeted Sean Cassidy, now headmaster to Generation X as Banshee, but was defeated by Cassidy's student Chamber (Jonothan Starsmore).  Escaping again, Red targeted yet another longtime adversary, Maverick, still possessing the C-Synth.  Although stricken with the Legacy virus, Maverick, aided by fellow Team X alumnus John Wraith, trapped Red in an abandoned Weapon X facility, &amp; Wraith manipulated military airplanes into bombing the base.  Surviving, even this onslaught, Red temporarily set aside his grudges &amp; became a mercenary.  Employed with other Russian super-agents in General Tskarov's capitalist schemes, he fought Daredevil (Matt Murdock) &amp; Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff) but was defeated.When Sabertooth went on a killing spree, news reports of his actions drew Omega Red's attention &amp;, vengeful once more, he battled his old foe for the first time in decades.  Red planned to us his death spores to weaken Sabertooth's healing factor &amp; enslave him as a bargaining tool in regaining the C-Synth, believed to be held by Elana Ivanova, a mutant seeking vengeance on Sabertooth.  Ultimately, however, Sabertooth was too ferocious even for Red, who was forced to flee for his life.  Subsequently hired by crimelord Ivan Pushkin, Red joined Pushkin's efforts to provoke war between the terrorist groups Hydra &amp; AIM while stealing their resources for himself.  When Maverick intervened, however, Red abandoned the endeavor to again pursue both vengeance  &amp; a chance at the C-Synth.  Pushed from a mountaintop in battle with Maverick, he again survived.In a rare bout compassion, Omega Red renewed his alliance with both Acolytes &amp; the Fenris twins, along with Pyro (St. John Allerdyce), Avalanche (Dominic Petros), &amp; Feral (Maria Callasantos), to seek a cure for the Legacy virus, which had infected a number of Russian mutants.  Believing the High Evolutionary's Isotope E to be such a cure, red &amp; his associates battled their quarry's defenders, Quicksilver &amp; the Knights of Wundagore, but the encounter ended with Red &amp; the others bound in his coils, the Acolytes abandoning them to their fate.  Unable to cure his countrymen, red returned to Russia &amp; to government service.  When the government lost control of Province 13's experimental mutant children, red hunted the most dangerous escapees, again battling the X-Men in the process.Later, Omega Red entered organized crime as an enforcer for the General, formerly a high-ranking KGB official.  Sabertooth recruited Red &amp; cyborg Lady Deathstrike to attack Wolverine's friends &amp; family, &amp; Red, hating Wolverine even more than he hated Sabertooth, agreed to join forces against their common enemy.  After luring Wolverine into a trap, however, Sabertooth teleported away with him, denying Red &amp; Deathstrike their vengeance.  Rather than dwell on the incident, Red used resources acquired in the General's service to become New York's Red Mafia kingpin, reveling in political &amp; corporate power.  When Maverick, as Agent Zero, hunted Sabertooth for his betrayal of &amp; theft from the latest Weapon X Project, Red, not recognizing his longtime enemy, provided information on Sabertooth's whereabouts, exacting revenge on his betrayer, but otherwise seemed willing to abandon his vendettas for his new ventures.Although less troubled by his death-spore condition than before, Omega Red apparently realized he might eventually worsen until even the C-Synth could not help him.  Believing a Korean bioweapons firm could provide a cure, he searched for the firm's ironic price, the C-Synth itself, as did Wolverine for his own reasons.  Wolverine located Maverick, but Red attacked both men.  Learning Maverick had left the device with the Black Widow in Germany, Wolverine was forestalled by SHIELD agents, who captured Red in a gel-like substance.  Briefly held by SHIELD, Red was extradited &amp; subjected to inhumane experimentation in the famous Red Room, much as he had been by the KGB so many years before.  His healing factor enhanced, Red fought Wolverine &amp; his fellow X-Men Colossus (Piotr Rasputin) &amp; Nightcrawler (Kurt Wagner) when they too were captured by the Red Room.  Defeated once more, he was re-imprisoned by SHIELD. Most recently, Omega Red was transferred to Vutluga Prison in Russia, where Wolverine eventually arrived during his search for Romulus.  Red attacked him, having been placed there through Romulus' machinations, &amp; he used the other prisoners as a resource to drain while he fought Wolverine.  Wolverine used the C-Synth to position Red beneath some prison gates, that he released, trapping Red when they slammed down.  Red escaped shortly after, &amp; tracked the C-Synth &amp; Wolverine to the Hughesovka Ironworks #5, still in Russia, where he was held captive by the mutant, Wildchild.  He went after the C-Synth, piercing Wildchild through the throat with one of his coils &amp; cast him into a cauldron of molten iron.  Wolverine had already escaped by crawling through the hot liquid metal &amp; reached St. Petersburg, Russia 2 days later to receive the Muramasa Blade, a sword forged with all Wolverine's rage, sent by request from another old foe &amp; secret agent Black Widow.  Wolverine used the sword to presumably kill Omega Red.",

      "biography": "When Charles Xavier telepathically rendered Magneto catatonic, he unknowingly absorbed Magneto’s dark ego. Magneto’s negative emotions merged with Xavier’s suppressed urges, forming a powerful, dormant psionic entity - the self-dubbed Onslaught. Rising anti-mutant hysteria, Legacy Virus casualties and Xavier’s failure to rehabilitate Sabretooth all increased Xavier’s frustration. When anti-mutant humans killed young mutant Dennis Hogan near the Xavier Institute, Onslaught finally awakened within Xavier, and it decided to achieve Xavier’s dream of peaceful mutant/human coexistence by utilizing the interdimensional firm Landau, Luckman &amp; Lake’s warp portals to bond humanity into a collective intelligence. To this end, Onslaught attempted to generate fear to heighten psionic activity. In Vancouver, B.C., Onslaught sought to recruit Xavier’s step-brother Cain Marko, the criminal Juggernaut. When Marko declined, Onslaught mentally blocked Juggernaut from remembering its true identity, and magnetically threw him to New Jersey.Learning the mutant-hunting Sentinels could store psionic energy, Onslaught abducted scientists to create a Sentinel army. Soon after, Xavier encountered X-Man (Nate Grey) on the astral plane, who pulled Xavier’s astral form into the physical world. Onslaught thus escaped Xavier’s mind, but was still “tethered” to Xavier. To assist disseminating his hyper-psionic energy, Onslaught had the mutant teleporter Gateway abduct the psionic mutant Chamber, sent the armored mutant Post to “test” the X-Men and Cable, and recruited and empowered other mutants such as Blob, Mimic and Holocaust. Now fully possessing Xavier, Onslaught revealed Xavier’s suppressed darker memories to Jean Grey, hoping to recruit her Phoenix Force experience to gain more power. Rejecting Onslaught, Jean removed the Juggernaut’s mental block, discovering that Onslaught was Xavier. Onslaught then trapped Juggernaut’s consciousness inside Marko’s own empowering Ruby of Cyttorak, and created the child-like psionic projection Charlie to befriend and capture vastly powerful mutant child Franklin Richards.As Xavier, Onslaught attempted to lead the X-Men to war against humans. When the X-Men resisted, Onslaught revealed itself and attempted to destroy them. Onslaught then mentally enslaved the Hulk and sent him after Cable, but Cable and Storm freed the Hulk. Onslaught captured X-Man, adding both his and Franklin’s psionic powers to its own. It sent the Sentinels to Manhattan to sow panic, created a Central Park citadel, and unleashed an electromagnetic pulse. The X-Men, Fantastic Four, Avengers and even Doctor Doom opposed Onslaught, and after Thor freed Xavier, Onslaught became even more powerful.Concluding that no one was worthy to live, Onslaught decided to obliterate humanity and created a second sun. While Thor and Storm sought to minimize the resultant climactic damage, the Hulk had Jean Grey turn off his human mind, resulting in a rage-fuelled Hulk who shredded Onslaught’s psi-armor. Onslaught exploded, separating the Hulk from his human side, and became a being of pure mental energy. Thor began disrupting Onslaught’s form from within, and the other Avengers, the Fantastic Four, and several non-mutant allies weakened it further. As Onslaught dissipated, both Franklin and X-Man were rescued. Though believed dead, the heroes were actually transported to a pocket universe subconsciously created by Franklin where they briefly encountered a manifestation of Onslaught, heralding his future return.",

      "biography": "In 1602, Count Otto von Doom was the hereditary ruler of Latveria and monarch of Castle Doomstadt. Known as Otto the Handsome, Doom ruled as a vicious monarch over his Latverian subjects. When the four members of the Fantastick came under his notice, Doom knew he had something valuable, and he captured the four and imprisoned them within the depth of his castle. Over the years, Doom consulted the leader of the four, Sir Richard Reed, forcing him to teach his knowledge of science to him and often bringing Reed oddities to study and unravel their secrets.Queen Elizabeth I ruled England at the time, and she had recently sent her spymaster Nicholas Fury to retrieve a secret, Templar treasure from an old man and his cart. Doom lusted after the treasure, as he did with anything that promised power, and he sent his own people after the treasure. He also sent an assassin after the queen, as well as the young English woman, born in the American colonies, named Virginia Dare. Though the assassin which sent after Virginia Dare failed, the mechanized toy, which he sent to the queen’s court used a vial of aqua regia to poison the queen and anyone around her. But it was his paramour, Natasha, called the most dangerous woman in England by her blind friend, who was most effective and captured the old man’s treasure, the old man, and the blind man who was often called a devil.Doom imprisoned the blind man and the old man, but foolishly confused the treasure for a shiny bauble that the old man used to distract him from the true treasure: the old, wooden staff of the Thunder God, Thor. Doom turned to Reed to uncover the secrets of the sphere, but only learned that electricity might activate it. Soon, however, Carlos Javier and his band of witchbreed attacked Doom’s castle, seeking to steal back the staff. Doom’s men halted their attack until Captain Benjamin of the Fantastick rocked against his stone, prison walls, freeing the old man who used the staff to turn himself into Thor. Once the Thunder God had brought a massive storm, Javier’s student, Robert, used the moisture in the air to stop Doom’s cannons. The battle ended shortly afterwards, with the four from the Fantastick having broken free due to their Captain’s efforts, and faced off against Doom. Without knowing more about the sphere, Doom used a bolt of Thor’s lightning to try and power it, but it exploded instead, scarring him severely and seemingly killing him. The band of heroes soon left him smoking on top of his own castle, and flew off to fix the rift in the universe.Natasha found Doom moment later, barely alive, and begging to have her cover his mutilated, once handsome, face.",

      "biography": "Paibok was a captain in the Skrull army who sent Lyja, his ex-lover to Earth to impersonate Alicia Masters in order to infiltrate the Fantastic Four. Months after Lyja arrived she began to have feelings for Johnny Storm, the Human Torch and started to change her mind about betraying the team. However Paibok demanded she bring the Fantastic Four to his base on Warworld. Lyja agreed and lead the four heroes to Warworld where Paibok faced them. As the battle started it seemed as if Paibok was about to win, but due to some fast thinking the Fantastic Four managed to blow up Warworld and end Paiboks' scheme. Paibok later formed an alliance with Devos the Devastator in order to defeat the Fantastic Four. Lyja was still with the Fantastic Four at the time and met with Paibok in secret, who granted her superhuman powers. He then ordered her to kill the Human Torch. She agreed for the moment and along with Devos and Paibok attacked the Torch at Empire State University. The resulting battle caused massive damage to the surroundings and half of the University was burned to the ground. Paibok, Devos, and Lyja then witnessed the Fantastic Four fighting an alternate version of themselves. As the battle continued Lyja saw Johnny get hurt and realized her love for Johnny was true. She then turned on Paibok and Devos as the real Fantastic Four triumphed. Realizing Devos and himself were no match for Lyja and the Fantastic Four the two retreated. Later Devos and Paibok attacked the Human Torch at his trial and during the battle the two were forced to retreat.Time passed and Paibok grew bitter towards the Torch for stealing his lover. Devising a plan he formed the Fearsome Foursome, whose members included Klaw, Devos, and Huntara. The Foursome then attacked the Fantastic Four and Lyja at the Baxter Building. During the fight Paibok managed to teleport the two teams to the new Skrull home world were the Fantastic Four and Lyja became slaves. However his victory was short lived when Devos turned on him and revealed his plot to destroy all Skrulls. In order to save the Skrull race Paibok managed to send Devos and himself into sub-space, apparently killing them.However Paibok survived and fought against the Human Torch and the cloned Spider-Man alongside a multi-colored Venom spawn. He then returned and forced Skrull scientists to enhance his already fearsome powers. With these new powers he led a small band of renegade Skrulls to Earth in order to capture the infant Watcher, Talmadge. As he was about to capture the young Watcher, Kree forces, including Staak The Evolver and the Thing managed to halt his plans. During the battle that followed Paibok was defeated and taken prisoner by the Kree. On his way to the prison, Kyln the transport ship crashed on Earth. Freed by the crash Paibok allied himself with the Blood Brothers and Lunatik in order to rebuild the ship. However he turned himself over to the intergalactic police when he was confronted by Drax.Not long after being incarcerated within Kyln the Annihilation Wave hit the Kyln freeing Paibok. Somehow Annihilus gained control of Paibok and throughout the Annihilation ordeal Paibok worked for Annihilus. However as soon as Annihilus was defeated by Nova, his forces were free from his control, including Terrax and Paibok. The two teamed together and escaped from their former masters, landing on a planet inhabited by Centaurians. There Paibok and Terrax helped liberate the locals from a cosmic monster. After the battle with the monster Paibok and Terrax went their separate ways.Paibok's current whereabouts are unknown.",

      "image": "https://terrigen-cdn-dev.marvel.com/content/prod/1x/pala.jpg",
      "biography": "Virtually nothing is known about the background of the mercenary who calls himself Paladin. It is not known why he decided to become an adventurer (beyond his obvious swashbuckling bravado) or where he got the special weaponry he uses. In his first recorded exploit, he crossed paths withDaredevil while both were on the trail of the villainous Purple Man. The Purple Man had manipulated the industrialist Maxwell Glenn into committing criminal acts for which he was being prosecuted, and Daredevil became personally involved, as he was dating Glenn’s daughter, Heather. In contrast, for Paladin, it was just business. He had been hired to take down the Purple Man by one former victims. Paladin and Daredevil crossed paths twice as they worked separately on the case, until on their third encounter they joined forces. The Purple Man eluded them both, however, when he fell into the water around Ryker's Island Prison and presumably drowned.Paladin was then hired by a woman named Marsha Roberts who wanted protection from her former boyfriend who had been transformed into a radioactive madman calling himself Phantasm. Similarly, Paladin was hired by Christine Michaels to track down her husband who had been transformed into Thermo the Thermatronic Man. Thermo was believed to be the so-called Street Stalker who was plaguing Manhattan, and Spider-Man bumped into Paladin when tracking him down. The two fought Thermo outside a nightclub, which alerted Dazzler, and it took the combined efforts of all three heroes to take Thermo down. He next appeared at the Caribbean island resort of Utopia Cay on behalf of a consortium of casino owners who hired him to apprehend the criminal Baron Brimstone who had been robbing their casinos. Ever the womanizer, he bumped into the vacationing Janet van Dyne, whose identity as the Wasp is publicly known, and they began seeing each other romantically. Together, they defeated Brimstone and parted amicably. He looked her up again when he was in New York, and wound up helping the Wasp apprehend several of the Avengers’ foes who were forming Zemo’s Masters of Evil at the time. The Wasp chided the mercenary that he helped despite the fact he was not being paid for it.Spider-Man came into conflict with Paladin when the mercenary was hired by Silver Sable to investigate a conspiracy against her native country of Symkaria. Spider-Man apologized for his intervention and helped Silver Sable and Paladin uncover an assassination plot. Paladin breezed off to another contract, leaving Spider-Man and Sable to deal with the assassination. Being a true gun-for-hire, Paladin has often found himself working on either side of the law. For instance, he was once hired by Vincent Mangano, godfather of a Maggia crime family, to kill the Punisher (although he claimed to be in it just for the money so that he could retire). Paladin’s first attempt failed, however, and Mangano set up his favored hitman to aid him. The two were still unsuccessful, as the Punisher found an ally in the U.S.Agent, who himself was hired to apprehend the Punisher but switched allegiances when he learned his orders were influenced by Mangano as well.  Paladin continued to work for Silver Sable, joining her elite version of the Wild Pack, the Outlaws, alongside Sandman, the Prowler, and others. One of the Paladin’s first excursions with the Outlaws brought him into conflict with Excalibur, as Silver Sable traced stolen technology from her nation to England. Captain Britain and Excalibur were touring the nuclear facility and briefly fought the Outlaws until they uncovered the true culprit, Arnim Zola and teamed up against the genetic monstrosity behind his experiments.He has even been hired by other costumed individuals, in particular the time when Diamondback sought help in rescuing her allies Asp and Black Mamba from the Serpent Society, who had imprisoned the two on charges of treason against the team. Paladin, Diamondback, and Captain America succeeded in rescuing the them, but almost immediately afterward, the three women were taken by M.O.D.A.M. to be a part of Superia’s army of female supervillains. Paladin and Captain America had to infiltrate a cruise liner full of women to rescue them, an aspect of the assignment that the lady killer, Paladin particularly enjoyed. Although Silver Sable quickly abandoned the Outlaws as a team, Paladin was often hired to work with her as a recurring member of her Wild Pack. At least once, Paladin was hired by the Hellfire Club to lead a group of mercenaries. At the time, Cable was on the trail of the mysterious Tomorrow Agenda, a program that Donald Pierce begun to seek out the power of the mutant Apocalypse for his own use. Cable easily dispatched the mercenary team in his search for Pierce, taking out Paladin with ease.More recently, Paladin was hired by Adrienne Frost to recover a mystic samurai sword from the island nation of Madripoor. Unfortunately, the job went sour, as the sword was protected by the Rising Sons. Paladin retreated to Frost, who was then co-headmistresses of the Massachusetts Academy, where he encountered the young mutants of Generation X. Frost sent both Paladin and Generation X after the sword, and Jubilee became smitten by the flashy Paladin. After a desperate battle, and a near-death experience for Paladin, they managed to retrieve the sword, and Paladin parted company.  About the same time, Frost set herself up as the new White Queen of the New York branch of the world conquering Hellfire Club, and later, with her influence on Paladin, used him to steal billions of dollars from the London chapter. Frost later claimed that, when going into hiding to escape the London Club's retribution, she killed Paladin.",

      "biography": "Eli Bradley is a young man with a family legacy spanning three generations of heroes. The grandson of the black Captain America, Isaiah Bradley, Eli is a passionate and loyal young man, and the hero and Young Avenger known as Patriot.Eli Bradley comes from a family of heroes. Eli's grandfather, Isaiah, one of the first Super-Soldiers produced by the U.S. military, fought against the Axis in World War II (see: \"Truth: Red, White &amp; Black\"), and his uncle, Josiah X, continued the family tradition, enlisting in Vietnam and recently taking up Isaiah's old Captain America uniform and joining the Crew. But Eli, unlike his grandfather and his uncle, was not a part of a sinister government plot to replicate Captain America's Super-Soldier Serum. Eli was never administered any type of Super-Soldier Serum, and was born with no superhuman abilities.At a time when the Avengers had disbanded, a young Kang The Conqueror traveled to the present era; sickened to have learned of the tyrant he would become from his future self, the teenage incarnation of Kang attempted to contact the Avengers in hopes to rewrite his personal history. Unsuccessful in his attempts to contact the Avengers, he downloaded the Vision's programming and operating system from the recently destroyed Avenger's remains, and accessed the Avengers' Failsafe program. Calling himself Iron Lad, the young Kang sought to recruit three New York-area based young men on the Vision's list of potential Avengers candidates to aid his cause; Eli's uncle, Josiah X, among them. However Josiah had been out of contact with his family for some time, and when Iron Lad encountered Eli, the youth told Iron Lad that he too was a super-soldier, wanting to live up to his family's heroic tradition. Eli used illegal Mutant Growth Hormone (MGH) pills to gain superhuman abilities, but informed Iron Lad he had received a blood transfusion from Isaiah following a violent altercation which caused heavy blood loss, resulting in the transference of the Serum and its desired effects. Wearing a costume very similar to that of Captain America's original sidekick, Bucky, Eli donned a full cowl and a set of five-pointed throwing stars as Patriot, and alongside his new teammates Teddy (Hulkling), Billy (Wiccan) and the Iron Lad, formed the Young Avengers.On one of their earliest outings the Young Avengers' super hero careers began to take off. After nearly bungling the rescue of a wedding party held hostage, the Young Avengers gained a persistent ally in Kate Bishop. Kate, a young woman in the wedding party, helped rescue herself, and Patriot, using one of Eli's discarded throwing stars. Immediately Eli and Kate demonstrated a contentious, and adversarial relationship. Eli found Kate annoying and arrogant, but their relationship was made more complex after Kate gave him one of Captain America's original triangular shields, and as Eli returned the favor and saved Kate's life as well.Following their initial encounter with Kang, the Young Avengers had been greatly changed. Eli's team had gained both Kate Bishop, and the teenage daughter of Scott Lang (Ant-Man), Cassie Lang (Stature), and had lost it's founder and leader, Iron Lad, for the sake of time itself. Though Eli was able to impress Captain America during this first encounter where the Young Avengers defeated Kang the Conqueror, both Iron Man and Captain America forbade the team from going out in costume again, using the threat of contacting and informing each teenager's parent. But the kids wouldn't take \"no\" for an answer, and after Kate unveiled their new headquarters at the abandoned Bishop Publishing building and new uniforms for the team, they went out into the world officially as \"Young Avengers.\"  Eli's new costume was only slightly different from his previous uniform, with a smaller, 'Zorro-style' mask and a scale-mail costume, like those of his grandfather, his uncle and Captain America.Soon after Eli's teammate Wiccan caught him in the act of using MGH to boost his powers. After taking MGH, Patriot fought Hyde one-on-one before injecting him with an overdose of MGH and knocking him unconscious. After being forcibly calmed by Wiccan's magics, Eli woke up in recovery at Avengers Tower, with the new Vision (now sporting the personality and memories of his friend Iron Lad) taking care of him. Eli revealed the true origins of his powers, then proceeded to quit the team. However he subsequently rejoined the Young Avengers after Hulkling was attacked by the Super-Skrull.During a battle between the Kree and the Skrulls, in which the Young Avengers fought alongside the New Avengers, Eli used himself to shield Captain America from gunfire, Eli was severly injured and rushed to a hospital. After the battle Captain America rushed to the hospital to give Eli a blood transfusion only to discover \"another Captain America\", Eli's Granfather, had already given Eli his blood. Since then Eli has gained the power he had previously pretended to have thanks to the transfusion.Eli joined Captain America's Secret Avengers during the Civil War.  Patriot led his team to assist the Runaways after they were attacked by the government.  The Young Avengers and the Runaways worked together when two of their members were captured, and the Runaways decided to stay out of the mix in the war.  Patriot managed to keep most of his team together, but Stature decided to join Iron Man's side.",

      "biography": "Robbie Baldwin is the son of Justin Baldwin, District Attorney of Springdale, Connecticut, and Maddy Naylor-Baldwin, a popular actress. His parents held very opposite views and often argued in front of Robbie, a fact made more poignant as their arguments often had to do with what Robbie should be doing with his life and future career.As a high school student, Robbie was interning at the Hammond Research Laboratory in Connecticut. There, Doctor Benson and two colleagues began the final stages of their attempts to tap an extra-dimensional energy source, but the researchers did not construct adequate safeguards and the energies began to overload Hammond Labs' equipment. Part of the energies fed back into the generator, shorting out the entire system. Unfortunately, Robbie had sneaked into the lab where the experiment was taking place, curious as to what all the hush-hush preparations had been for. Robbie was bombarded by energy from the dimension but survived, finding himself surrounded by weird energy bubbles, clad in an odd costume, and having a hollow and resonant voice. Panicking, Robbie sought to escape to the roof of the lab building where he encountered four masked gunmen. During the ensuing battle, Robbie discovered that his body now generated a kinetic energy field that protected him from any impact and made him a bouncing dynamo of kinetic energy.Shortly afterward, Robbie's parents were accosted by Johnny Roarke, a criminal Justin Baldwin had put away, and Robbie used his powers to defeat him. The media leaped to the story, reporting the appearance of a new hero, whom they dubbed \"the Masked Marvel.\" Robbie continued to use his powers to fight crime, and the Masked Marvel enjoyed a great deal of popularity from the townspeople, although his parents held very diametrical and vocal views about the costumed vigilante. Baldwin was forced to keep his power under control, avoiding any potential contact that might trigger his powers. He also spent much of his time trying capture Dr. Benson's cat, Niels, who was similarly caught in the energy experiment and gained Speedball-like powers, and using him to help understand his powers.During a trip to New York City, Robbie ended up helping Spider-Man and Daredevil stop the Purifiers of the High Evolutionary, but mostly Robbie fought criminals in Springdale, such as the Sticker, Leaper Logan, the Bug-Eyed Voice, and the Feathered Felon. Robbie hoped to become a big-time superhero, and even joined a tryout for the premier hero team Avengers, only to be rejected.  During a shopping trip to New York City with his mother he saw a battle breaking out involving Terrax, former herald of Galactus. Joining the fray along with the other heroes that would subsequently become the founding members of the New Warriors, Robbie agreed to join the team as well after Terrax was defeated.Despite the long distance he often had to travel, Robbie stayed with the New Warriors for a long tenure, quickly becoming an annoying but loveable kid brother to the older Warriors and continuing to grow in the development of his powers. Shortly after joining the team, he asked his teammates to join him in investigating the long absence of his mother, who had joined a fanatical ecological watchdog group, Project: Earth. The Warriors discovered the group wanted to kill Baldwin's mother, as her celebrity would serve to make her a martyr to their cause. Robbie helped save his mother and defeat Project: Earth, and in so doing he revealed his secret identity to her. Although shaken, she supported her son's lifestyle as a superhero.Speedball had battled numerous villains with the New Warriors, including Terrax, the Sphinx, the Puppet Master, Gideon, Force of Nature, Psionex, and the Folding Circle. At one point, the cosmic villain Magus created evil doppelgangers of Earth's heroes, and Robbie's duplicate used its powers to virtually destroy the town of Springdale. It also confronted Robbie's parents, and Robbie was forced to kill his duplicate. This led to his father discovering his secret identity, and Justin Baldwin denounced his son because of what he saw as vigilantism.Robbie’s parents got divorced, and Robbie chose to live with his mom in New York. This allowed him to develop deeper relationships with his teammates, notably Nova, Rage, and, perhaps more reluctantly, his neighbor Carlton LaFroyge (who used the knowledge of Robbie’s identity to force his way onto the team as Hindsight Lad.)When Timeslip joined the Warriors, telling of her visions of Speedball’s death, she and Robbie nevertheless developed the beginnings of a romantic friendship while seeking the truth behind these visions. At the same time, despite Speedball’s ever-increasing control over his powers, Robbie began experiencing severe spikes in his power levels that wreaked havoc over his immediate area.  The Warriors were confronted by the Sphinx, who claimed the presence of Speedball was creating chaos with time itself. They were also confronted with the evil techno-organic being Advent. The Sphinx succeeded in killing Speedball before escaping, and Advent left for the future. Timeslip, holding Speedball when he died, received memories from him in his dying moments-- memories of a citizen from the future named Darrion Grobe. Grobe, the son of the man who would become Advent, hoped to undo the meddling his father had done by traveling through the kinetic dimension to the past. He used futuristic technology to become a duplicate Robbie Baldwin/Speedball, replacing Speedball when he was trapped in the kinetic dimension by the Sphinx several months before. Timeslip used her knowledge and powers to transport the New Warriors to the future. There, a holographic persona of Darrion helped the Warriors to undo all of Advent's manipulations. Ultimately, the team had to enter the kinetic dimension to escape the future before it became re-made, and they brought back the true Speedball while returning home.Robbie has always been a New Warrior at heart. Even when the team seemed to be on a long hiatus, he and Nova helped re-form the Warriors to defeat Blastaar, adding new members Aegis and Bolt. Robbie and Nova even tried to pitch the New Warriors as an animated series, but they were forced to flee when they saw the producers’ unique take on the team.  Nevertheless, Speedball returned when the New Warriors were led by Night Thrasher into a unique re-branding as a reality-TV show. Robbie’s bouncy personality seemed a perfect fit despite the contentions of other teammates, and the team hit the road to become heroes for the common man throughout small-town America. Recently the New Warriors encountered Nitro, Speedfreek, Cobalt Man, and Coldheart and during the battle that followed Nitro used his power and caused a massive explosion killing the New Warriors and almost everyone around that area for an unknown distance. Speedball was seemingly killed during this explosion and was later ridiculed by TV talk show hosts.Speedball was later found alive (albeit barely), his powers apparently burned out. The media and the authorities made him the scapegoat for the Stamford disaster, which had sparked widespread anti-superhero sentiment and prompted the passing of a law requiring superheroes to register with the authorities. The government decided to make an example of Robbie, holding him without bail or trial while he was abused repeatedly by both guards and fellow inmates. His secret identity leaked to the press, hated by the public, disowned by his parents after he refused to admit to any wrongdoing, Robbie was offered a deal: he would be released if he became a government-registered super-hero, helping train other super-agents and hunting down unauthorized super-heroes. Robbie turned down the deal repeatedly on principle and was later shot by vigilante Mr. Stricker, whose daughter had died at Stamford.Narrowly surviving, Robbie soon discovered that he still had energy powers, but they were now fueled by his own physical pain, such as the near-constant pain of the bullet fragments lodged in his spine. Perhaps somewhat unhinged by this situation, and increasingly haunted\nby guilt regarding his role in the Stamford disaster, Robbie agreed to register after foiling a jailbreak by several super-criminals, asking only that Stricker be pardoned in exchange for his registration. No longer caring about anything except making himself suffer, Robbie also agreed to become a hero-hunting government super-agent. He did so in his new guise as Penance, wearing an armored costume whose spikes constantly pierce his own flesh, augmenting both his pain and his power.",

After executing a clean sweep at a terrorist base in Ransaphan, Thailand, Wisdom retired from active duty as Black Air's resident expert on Genosha and mutant affairs in general. He became the agency's liaison with the British superhero group Excalibur, whom he eventually aided in exposing Black Air's subversive criminal activities. Never the most popular bloke in the team, he became even less so when he started a relationship with the the young Kitty Pryde a.k.a. Shadowcat. Some team members worried that Kitty would only end up being hurt by the rougish Wisdom. Kitty's ex-boyfriend Colossus, having recently left the Acolytes, came to Muir Island seeking Kitty, and was shocked to spy her with Wisdom; not entirely in his right mind, he launched an unprovoked attack on Wisdom. The two came to blows and Colossus beat Wisdom almost to death, confining Wisdom to a wheelchair for some time. Though Wisdom was taken unawares and was drunk at the time, he managed to mount a defense which left Colossus in critical condition too. Following his romance with Kitty, Wisdom went on to create an independent espionage network to police the global intelligence community's treatment of mutants. As the leader and mentor of X-Force, Wisdom, now sporting an eye-patch due to the loss of an eye, at one point seemed to have been killed by genetic terrorist Doctor Niles Roman. His demise was subsequently exposed as a ruse, however, as was the loss of his eye. Wisdom subsequently joined British intelligence agency MI-13.Recently, in the wake of House of M|M-Day, Wisdom collaborated with Captain Britain, Sage, Juggernaut, Nocturne, Dazzler and others in battling the Dark X-Men, evil versions of the founding X-Men team and their mentor from an alternate reality. Subsequently, Wisdom called for the reformation of the team Excalibur, with the aforementioned as the prime members, even going so far as to procure a Home Secretary Decree indemnifying the Juggernaut of any crimes on British soil so that he could act as a full member of the team.",

And it's all a sham.This is William Robert \"Billy Bob\" Reilly, who is living his life as a first-rate poseur. His rather banal upbringing in a middle-class Jacksonville, Florida family certainly wouldn't catch the attention of X-Statix and his agent knew it. In an effort to get Billy Bob recruited to join the team, his crafty agent created a whole new and much more interesting take on the young man's life: a gangsta rapper persona with a dysfunctional family. Not only were they dysfunctional, his mother and father were \"alcoholics\" who turned young Billy Bob out into the streets not far from the \"trailer park\" where they lived. Sleazy? Sure. Deceitful? Of course. Did it work? Like a charm. After he and several others were recruited to replace X-Statix members killed in a mission gone awry. Phat didn't necessarily live up to the high-flying, high-profile lifestyle of the typical X-Statix. Expected to be out in front, soaking up all the media spotlight he could get, Phat instead hung back, content to speak his affected grammar and reap the piles of cash instead. But Spike Freeman put the kibosh on Phat's media-shy ways and forced him to get his face out there. So Phat and another media-shunning member, Vivisector, planned to steal some of the spotlight away from their teammates. Their initial plan was pretty pedestrian: show up loaded and act like bratty two-year-olds at U-Go Girl's television permiere. It semed to have some effect, but they needed to improve their juvenile efforts somehow. So they cooked up another scheme and decided to pretend to be gay. Trouble was, it turns out neither one was doing much pretending. Though they soon discovered they were in love, Phat had zero comfort with being so \"out\". When he reverted back to his churlish behavior. Vivisector had little choice but to dump him. Even though he wears his best \"bling bling\" and does his best to keep in character. Phat drops his developed persona to step up to plate for the X-Statix whenever he is needed. No matter how deep he goes to disguise his outward appearance, Phat is still a mutant willing to fight the good fight against those who would do his team harm as he was killed protecting his teammates from a bomb.",

      "image": "https://terrigen-cdn-dev.marvel.com/content/prod/1x/phoenix_force.jpg",
      "biography": "Born of the void between states of being, the Phoenix Force is a child of the universe. In the dying moments of the previous universe, the Force saved all existence from eternal damnation, enabling Eternity to preserve the humanoid Galan, ensuring his re-creation as Galactus. The Force was subsequently reborn from the cosmic fires of the “Big Bang.” Later, it encountered the malevolent Le Bete Noir and trapped it in the center of a still-cooling planet Earth. The Force was drawn back to Earth when it was awakened to reality by Feron, a sorcerer from an alternate Earth who had traveled with his master Necrom to a tower on Earth-616 to witness an alignment of dimensional interfaces. The Force joined with Feron, allowing itself to be shaped by his dreams into the form of a giant fiery bird and experiencing a spectrum of new sensations. At the moment of the alignment, Feron bade the Force to project the essence of the tower throughout the multiverse, so that it existed on every plane of reality simultaneously, creating an energy matrix. Necrom sought to access the matrix to allow him to compress all alternate Earths into a singularity, the energy released from which would endow him with godlike power, and to that end he tore out the portion of the Force that had bonded to Feron. In agonized confusion over the violation of its essence, the Force fled. Necrom bound the stolen Force with a portion of his own essence, and left it to incubate in a corpse he dubbed the Anti-Phoenix.\n\nIn time, the Force’s pain subsided and it discovered that it was unable to return to its natural state. Hundreds of years later, the Force learned that the universe would come under threat from manipulation of the M‘kraan Crystal - a hypercubical nexus of realities - by the mad Shi’ar Emperor D’Ken. To prevent this, the Force sought an avatar through which it could act and so returned to Earth, seeking out Feron. Instead, the Force encountered Jean Grey, a member of the heroic mutant X-Men team, whose mind the Force had touched earlier. Grey was dying from the effects of solar radiation while piloting a damaged space shuttle in order to save her fellow X-Men. The Force appeared to Grey and offered to save her. She accepted, and so the Force created an exact duplicate of her body for itself, into which it transferred a portion of her consciousness. The Force then sealed her comatose body inside a healing cocoon, and after the shuttle crashed into Jamaica Bay, near New York City, the Force emerged from the waters, calling itself Phoenix. The X-Men believed it to be the real Jean Grey, having died and returned to life with vast new powers. Phoenix and the X-Men opposed D’Ken, who exposed the universe to the tremendous gravitational forces contained within the Crystal’s core. Phoenix entered the Crystal and repaired the stasis field, thus saving the cosmos. Phoenix continued to serve as a member of the X-Men, but ultimately its human form was unable to cope with the Force’s immense power. At first, Grey’s strong moral sense kept the Force in check, but Phoenix succumbed to the psionic manipulation of Mastermind. Unable to fully free itself of the sinister side of its personality that Wyngarde exposed it to, and with its human consciousness ill-equipped to repress it, the Force’s primal urges overwhelmed Phoenix, causing it to become the malevolent Dark Phoenix. Due to the limitations of its physical form, Dark Phoenix hungered for more energy and transported itself to the star D’Bari, absorbing all the energy from it. As a result, the star turned supernova, annihilating one of its planets. Dark Phoenix destroyed a Shi’ar starship which had attacked it in retaliation for the D’Bari’s deaths, then returned to Earth where it was opposed by the X-Men and Professor Xavier. He reinforced Grey’s personality, allowing Phoenix to reject its cosmic power.\n\nThe Shi’ar still judged it necessary to obliterate Phoenix’s powers entirely, lest it become Dark Phoenix again. The X-Men fought the ruling in a trial by combat against members of the Shi’ar’s Imperial Guard in the Blue Area of Earth’s moon, but during the battle Phoenix reverted to Dark Phoenix. Realizing that it could never fully retain control, Phoenix acted as the real Grey would have. Before the eyes of a horrified Cyclops, it committed suicide by telekinetically triggering an energy cannon, disintegrating its mortal shell. Later reflecting on its folly, the Force sought to undo the damage it had done by returning the life-force it had taken from Grey. On its return to Earth, it sensed the astral form of the time-traveling Rachel Summers, the daughter of Earth-811's Jean Grey. After returning Grey’s missing life-force, which was instead received by Grey’s clone Madelyne Pryor, the Force followed Rachel back to the future of Earth-811. There, it revealed itself to Kate Pryde, who asked the Force to give Rachel a new lease on life. The Force agreed and took Rachel as its host, supercharging her ability to time travel and causing her to physically travel back in time to Earth-616. Rachel was unaware that she hosted the Force’s essence until she took on the codename Phoenix. The Force then bonded to her fully and ensured that Rachel could only access as much power as she could safely wield, having learned from its past mistake. Adventuring with Rachel and the British super-team Excalibur for a time, the Force ultimately encountered Necrom’s Anti-Phoenix. After a cataclysmic battle, Rachel allowed Necrom to possess the Force, gambling that its infinite power would be too much for him. Necrom’s physical form exploded, and Rachel was destroyed in the blast. The Force gathered her shattered psyche and restored her body, promising Excalibur to protect and nurture her until she fully healed. Through Rachel’s eyes, the Force was able to experience the simple beauty of existence. In space, it encountered the world-devourer Galactus, who revealed to the Force the nature of its existence. Tormented with the knowledge that its desire to explore humanity had prevented generations of life from being born, the Force fled. Rachel reentered the timestream and emerged some 2,000 years into the future of Earth-4935. There, she encountered Diamanda Nero, daughter of that era’s mutant despot Apocalypse, and, in order to defeat her, was forced to purge herself of the Force.\n\nFree again, the Force traveled back into the past, drawn once again to Earth-616. En route, it was transported to the Ultraverse (Earth-93060) by a sentient alien starship that had crash-landed there eons ago. Buried deep within the Earth, the ship sought to reunite itself with its twin trapped within Earth’s sun, and intended to use the Force’s energy to power the recombination. Impaled on a lance of energy that linked the two ships, the Force fought back and managed to free itself, though not before the ship was able to bond them empathetically. Wounded, the Force sought out a host to protect it as it healed. Inhabiting the body of the super-strong hero Prime, the Force was opposed by the X-Men and Prime’s teammates in UltraForce. Exhausting Prime’s physical form, the Force found another host in Amber Hunt, who had previously been possessed by the ship’s essence. The heroes were able to free Hunt from the Force, after which they took the fight to the ship, severing its link to the Force. Seeking revenge, the Force attacked the ship, threatening the stability of the planet. The heroes were able to drive the Force into another portal, and it emerged four billion years in the past. Unleashing vast energies while transmigrating itself through time and space, the Force inadvertently (and ironically) caused the damage to the ship that forced it to crash-land to begin with.\n\nThe Force returned to Earth-616 once more and manifested itself within Jean Grey before she was seemingly killed by an electromagnetic pulse. This shattered the Force into billions of pieces. Incubating in the core of creation known as the White Hot Room, the Force was ripped back to reality by a Shi’ar device that forcibly reconstituted it. Injured, the Force fell to Earth and sought out Cyclops to use his mutant optic power to heal itself. To that end, it searched for Cyclops’ love Jean and, finding her dead, resurrected her to house its power once more. Opposed by the X-Men again, the Force was lured into possessing the body of Cyclops’ new love Emma Frost before Jean was able to reassert control. The Force realized that Jean was one of its missing pieces, its prime host, and so it merged with her fully. Returning to the White Hot Room, the Force set out to find its other pieces.",

      "biography": "Genis-Vell was originally \"born\" at the age of thirteen after his mother Elysius used DNA from the original Captain Marvel to conceive a son. She then had Genis rapidly aged and imbued with false memories of growing up on Titan among his late father's friends and associates, all so that he might be better able to protect himself from his father's enemies. He was told by his mother that his father was Starfox which he believed until Elysius sent the Silver Surfer to fetch Genis back to Titan, as the young man was in the middle of squandering his life, roaming the universe as a hedonist and gambler. After the Surfer retrieved Genis, saving from a bar brawl, Elysius told Genis the truth of his origins and gave him the Nega-Bands of Captain Marvel. Adapting the name of Legacy to carry on his father's heroic tradition, he became an explorer and an adventurer like his father, albeit a rather rash and unwise one at first. Regardless, Genis gradually became known as the new Captain Marvel thanks to his father's reputation, despite his own reluctance to assume that title. At the time, Monica Rambeau had long since established herself as a new Captain Marvel herself, but she conceded the title to Genis out of respect for Mar-Vell's legacy after Genis and Rambeau teamed up to defeat the Controller, who pitted the two heroes against each other to test his own abilities. Shortly after his encounter with Rambeau, Genis finally accepted the Captain Marvel title as his own after winning a victory over homicidal madman Zey-Rogg and his sister Una-Rogg, the children of Mar-Vell's late arch-enemy Yon-Rogg.Genis gradually matured into his inherited role but, at times, still faced a reputation as a shallow fool thanks to his earlier, less impressive exploits. In particular, he got off to a rocky start with Mar-Vell's longtime friend and former partner, Rick Jones, who resented the \"instant heir\". Jones and Genis quarreled bitterly in their first meeting, during which Jones exploited Genis on his TV talk show and an angry Genis trashed Jones's studio in a huff.When the Avengers became involved in the time-spanning cosmic conflict known as \"The Destiny War\", the mystery man Libra used Rick Jones's latent psionic powers to assemble a band of Avengers from various time periods, including the a future incarnation of Captain Marvel-- an older and more mature Genis with more experience and greater powers. Apparently, in at least one timeline, Genis was destined to become a member of the Avengers as the new Captain Marvel, a prospect that Jones found discouraging. The future-era Genis, for his part, seemed unusually bitter and fatalistic, and his bad feelings seemed to focus on Jones. Setting aside their various differences, Jones, Genis and the other Avengers joined forces to win the Destiny War by thwarting the Time Keepers' attempted destruction of most of the timestream's humanity-populated timelines. During the climax of this conflict, Jones suffered fatal injuries while destroying the Time-Keepers' chrono-cannon. To save Jones's life, the future Genis reluctantly merged his form and life force with that of Jones, just as the original Captain Marvel had shared a symbiotic relationship with Jones years earlier.When Jones returned from the Destiny War to the present day, the present-day Genis was surprised to find himself automatically taking his future self's place in the symbiotic relationship with Jones. The present-day Genis assumed the altered appearance and enhanced powers of his future self in the process, but was still greatly distressed to be trapped in a shared existence with a man he despised. Jones was no happier about it, but the reluctant duo were forced to adjust to their situation, with the experienced adventurer Jones served as mentor to the novice hero Genis.Genis had developed several meditative techniques to help him control the cosmic awareness that was thrust upon him taking his future self's place, but he was often forced to choose between situations to involve himself in. When one such decision resulted in the death of a young alien woman, Genis saw that this meant would result in the loss of potential universal peace. In anguish, his cosmic awareness overwhelmed his mind and Genis was shocked into a catatonic state for almost a month. When he awoke, Genis had become insane.Genis determined he needed to learn discipline to better solve the problems he envisioned with his cosmic awareness. He spent some time with the vigilante known as the Punisher, saying he admired the single-minded devotion the Punisher used to accomplish his goals. However, Genis determined the Punisher truly couldn't handle the issues Genis must tackle and he left him. Next, Genis confronted his father's former mentor in the Kree army. Instead of learning from him, however, Genis killed the alien captain and took his place, hoping that time in the military would teach him discipline. Over time, Genis took the mistress of a commanding officer as his lover. The mistress ended up being an agent for the alien Shi'ar, and the commanding officer ordered Genis to kill her. Instead, Genis killed his commanding officer and turned the gun on himself, apparently committing suicide.Genis was resurrected by the cosmic being Entropy, offspring of the embodiment of Eternity, who revealed himself as instigating Genis' madness. Entropy wanted to fulfill its perceived role by destroying his \"father\", and asked for Genis' help. Genis agreed, and the two somehow succeeded in destroying Eternity by reducing it to a state of entropy. Genis and Entropy brought Rick Jones and his new associate Epiphany to join them. Jones convinced Entropy to start a new role for himself, one of creator, and Entropy re-created reality by becoming Eternity. Genis had a hand in re-shaping the universe, placing himself and Jones prior to Genis' developing madness so these events wouldn't happen again, but despite Genis' best intentions, the renewed reality had its share of discrepancies, including the presence of his sister, Phyla-Vell.Genis continued to battle the overwhelming influence of his cosmic awareness, taking downright villainous actions such as endowing an alien serial killer with power, challenging the gods of Asgard, and threatening the Kree with extinction. Rick Jones tried to keep Genis in check by inducing mind-numbing pain through their mental connection, but soon even this trick would fail. Genis began influencing Jones' actions through their link, and ultimately induced Jones to be killed. In trying to reaffirm his perception of reality, however, Genis resurrected Rick (a feat made possible with their molecular bond). Finally, a coalition of Titan Eternals, including Elysius and Phyla-Vell, confronted Genis. A protracted battle ensued, ending after Genis was pulled into a portal to another dimension meant for his enemies alone. Beaten and broken, Genis promised to once again dedicate himself to becoming a force for good.    Genis first created a base of operations on Saturn's moon Hyperion, but after only a few adventures, he was confronted by the cosmic being Eulogy, who revealed he had placed himself in Genis' and Rick's life at the time of their bonding but had determined their series of adventures had run its course. He arranged for the two to be no longer bonded together and encouraged Genis to surrender to the ending of his efforts. Instead, Genis was still determined to make up for his past misdeeds. He traveled to Earth to join the like-minded villains-turned-heroes, the Thunderbolts.His presence among the Thunderbolts caused quite a stir among his teammates, especially the romantic overtones he used with Songbird (with whom his future \"Destiny War\" counterpart had a relationship). He got into a scuffle with the Thunderbolt named Atlas, and instead of saving New York from an attack by Fathom's Five, Altas secretly attacked Genis instead, gravely wounding him and causing him to go into a protective energy cocoon in order to heal. After he was healed, Genis emerged from his cocoon physically transformed-- his body had absorbed the Nega-Bands and his body was transformed into photonic energy. He rejoined the Thunderbolts, calling himself Photon (which got him into another argument with Monica Rambeau who had started calling herself Photon after Genis took the Captain Marvel name. Still, Rambeau encouraged him to keep the codename). As Photon, Genis then became a full-fledged member of the Thunderbolts and has faced many challenges including Fathom's Five, Batroc's Brigade, the Purple Man, and the Avengers. During his battle with the Avengers he managed to prove himself so powerful that he easily bested the Sentry, an immensely powerful being, in combat.Unfortunately, Genis' powers began growing out-of-control. Baron Zemo, using the power of the Moongems, had discovered this by witnessing the destruction of the world at the hands of Genis in countless various possible futures. He came to the conclusion that Genis must die for the universe to exist, and he formed his own group in order to oppose Genis and the Thunderbolts, who he knew would stand beside their teammate. During the confrontation, Genis himself revealed he had known of his potential for destruction, and that he had been training to control his powers through concentration. After a protracted battle that pitted Thunderbolt against former Thunderbolt, Zemo manipulated the brain-dead Blackout's power to sever Photon's physical form and scatter the pieces across the Darkforce Dimension.",

      "biography": "A Prince on his Homeworld of Laxidazia, Pip enjoyed painting pictures of the night sky. After a long night of drinking with Laxidazian Trolls, Pip woke up to find himself with the characteristics of a Troll. Because Trolls were considered a degenerate species, Pip was exiled. Pip left Laxidazia for a life of wandering and debauchery among the stars.Getting into trouble on scores of planets, Pip was imprisoned on the Universal Church of Truth spaceship Great Divide and slated for execution along with the other renegades and non-humanoid species the UCT had deemed unproductive and fit only to be chemically recycled into their basic elements. There Pip met artificial human Adam Warlock, a fellow UCT captive being transported to the UCT's Homeworld, Sirus X for questioning. After helping other prisoners revolt against the spaceship's crew. Pip joined Warlock's quest to stop the Magus. Warlock's evil alternate future self. The duo piloted a stolen shuttlecraft to Homeworld and Warlock left Pip in the city to confront the Church's temporal leader the Matriarch, seeking the truth of the Magus' origins. Miffed at being abandoned right when things were getting interesting, Pip entered into the local tavern where he met with Gamora, so-called deadliest woman in the galaxy, who offered to help Pip free Warlock from the Sacred Palace and aided them in defeating the Magus. They discovered Warlock right after he freed himself from a brainwashing session, and the trio confronted the Magus, who quickly knocked Pip out. Pip woke up minutes later. unable to help either Warlock or Gamora stop the Magus from summoning the In-Betweener to start the process that would transform Warlock into the Magus. Rescued by Gamora's master, Thanos's ship, Sanctuary 1, where pip decided that following Warlock into the time portal set to change his future was safer than observing a fight between Magus and Thanos. Pip witnessed Warlock finally finding the key to prevent himself from turning into the Magus, removing much of his influence from the universe-616 timeline and re-inventing the Universal Church as a more benign entity in the process.Returned to Sirus X, Warlock and Pip indulged themselves at a local tavern until Warlock left to find answers to his new riddles among the stars. Left to his own devices, Pip found new adventures in saving the concubine Heather Delight from her master Pro-Boscis the Procurer, and latter in a rash of petty thefts to pay for his various vices. Pip then decided to see Warlock and Gamora had been up to lately; searching Sanctuary 1, he instead found Thanos, who destroyed Pip's mind. When Warlock finally found what was left of Pip, he absorbed Pip's soul in to his Soul Gem, sending it to the peaceful Soulworld where Pip was soon reunited with the souls of Warlock and Gamora, who were also victims of Thanos. Years later, after a visiting Silver Surfer warned Warlock (now Soulworld's leader) of the resurrected Thanos' plans to become the universe's Supreme Being using the Infinity Gauntlet, Pip and Gamora were resurrected with Warlock in the dead bodies of three petty criminals (pip possessed the late Ralph Bunker); Warlock transmuted these husk into exact duplicates of his, Pip,s, and Gamora's original bodies, with their original powers enhanced. While Warlock and other Earth heroes and cosmic entities sought to strip Thanos of his Infinity Gauntlet, Pip kept Doctor Strange company until Warlock won the Gauntlet. Pip, Strange and Gamora convinced Warlock not to use the Gauntlet to eliminate all evil impulses like competitiveness and ambition from all sentient beings, which would have led to despair and apathy. When the Living Tribunal ruled that Warlock was not fit to be a Supreme Being, Warlock dispersed the Gauntlet's Infinity Gems to his \nInfinity Watch - Gamora (Time Gem), Pip (Space Gem), Thanos (Reality Gem, and secret \"silent partner\" of the team), Moondragon (Heather Douglas, Mind Gem), and Drax the Destroyer (Power Gem) - those he deemed best able to safeguard the Gem's from malicious adventurers. He gave the Space Gem to Pip, since his roguish nature would enable him to keep the gem safe from potential thieves. While left restore his spirit after  divesting himself of divinity, the others dispersed with Pip teleporting to Earth to go joyriding in the Fantastic Four's Fantasticar and an Avengers Quinjet until he was captured by Omega (a disguised Man-Beast), who captured Gamora, Drax, Moondragon. Man-Beast used their Gem's power's to create  the energy creature Infinity Thrall, which nearly killed Warlock before he tricked it into destroying the starship engines used to create it. A revived Pip, teleported the Watch onto Monster Island, where the Mole Man talked the now organized team into using the island as their base. When Thanos Contacted the Watch about the plans of the reborn Magus, Pip teleported them to the Infinity Well in Death's other-dimensional palace to further learn the Magus' plans, but they were forced to flee before they could learn anything useful. Regrouping in another dimension, the Watched battled a group of Earth's heroes whom the Magus had tricked into believing that Thanos and Warlock were responsible for the plague of doppelgangers assaulting the Earth. Eventually, Galactus teleported everyone onto his ship and linked everyone's minds to quickly resolve the misunderstanding. Warlock reassembled the Infinity Gauntlet, only to have the Magus kidnap him and steal the Gauntlet's power. After Warlock defeated the Magus, the Watch regained their respective Gems and returned to Monster Island to recuperate and watch over a now-catatonic Warlock. Pip made a half-hearted attempt to become the Watch's new leader, but decided that Gamora was better suited to the role than he was.    Revived by Eternity, Warlock led the Watch in helping the Silver Surfer rescue the soul of his lover Shalla Bal from the demonic Mephisto and restoring her  to life. After fending off an attack form the time traveling amnesiac strongman Maxam, the Watch fell prey to the schemes of Warlock’s “good half” the Goddess banished Warlock to a far distant dimension and convinced Gamora, Moondragon and others to join her crusade to cleanse the universe of sin. Pip then decided to become the Watch’s new leader as the Pipman and kidnapped Mister Fantastic to help find Warlock, only to have Drax and Maxam to decide that Mister Fantastic would make a better leader than Pip. Joining the remaining heroes at the Avengers Mansion, Pipman was forcibly bathed by some of them to reduce his personal stench to a more bearable level. Getting a reading off Professor X (via his temporary mindlink with Moondragon) of the Goddess’ location, Pip teleported himself to her  and used her new-created Cosmic Egg (a merging of several extradimensional Cosmic Cube-like objects) to turn her into a salt statue, leaving Pip in control of Egg. Proclaiming himself to be “King Pip,” he mulled over several possible uses for his new-found power, ranging from endless creature confronts to becoming a Supreme Being himself, until he decided all he truly wanted was to be like all the other heroes enough for them to throw him a birth day party. Before he could implement that wish, the Goddess’ hidden protector Silhouette Chord knocked him out and restored the Goddess to her former state. After Warlock defeated and imprisoned the Goddess in the Soul Gem, the freed Pip teleported him and the rest of the Watch away from the rest of the heroes before they had a chance to vent their frustrations over the Goddess’ actions on Warlock. Warlock had Pip teleport him to an insane Thor so he could cure his madness and place the thunder god in his dept. Thor was cured after a series of conflicts during which Pip rescued the group from Asgardian trolls, brought Thanos into the matter, and fought Odin and other Asgardians. Pip and the Watch then aided princess Maya of the Egolix-7 dimension and the mystic Darklore in overthrowing the the evil demi-godlike Count Abyss. After freeing hundreds of souls from the alien Lord Domitian's clutches, the Watch were robbed of their respective Gems buy the Earth-93060 (Ultraverse) vampire Rune, leading to the Watch's dissolution.  Months later Pip and Gamora reunited with Warlock and Drax to stop the Negative Zone ruler Lord Syphonn from destroying their dimension. More recently, Pip teleported Warlok from an alien mental ward and helped him bring the toddler Atleza Langunn to dying reality anchor Atlez before the nihilist Thanosi (rogue creations of Thanos) could kill her. Pip has added both Thanos and Warlock against the extradimensional Hunger, and helped stop the power-mad Champion of the Universe from destroying the alien Skards in his quest for worthy opponents to fight. He later testified as a character witness for Starfox when was accused of inappropriate use of his love powers on unwilling women, it is said that Pip has returned to his partying ways, until the next time his buddy Warlock needs him.   Recently Pip has appeared on Earth, fleeing the Asgardian death goddess Hela. Pip was able to avoid her detection by wearing a mystical hammer-like pendant; the origin of this powerful trinket remains unknown. Hela sought the assistance of Jamie Madrox and the X-Factor Detective Agency, while disguise as Halja. She wove a tale of how her precious pendant was stolen from her in Las Vegas by a thief known as Gofern. Madrox with the aid of Theresa quickly tracked the thief to a bar by the name of Saint Marks, where Theresa snatched the pendant from Gofern's neck, exposing his true identity. Pip pleaded for her to return the pendant before Hela arrived. Theresa failed to do so and Pip was captured by Hela and taken back to Las Vegas.",

It is unclear when she was born or how old she really is, though it has been stated she is young by Eternal standars. Pixie craved adventure and wished to become a hero, which led her out into the human world. She sought the Hipster and offered to become his sidekick, but he refused. She later met a young man with great strength, Oxbow, and decided he would become a hero and she would he his sidekick. Soon after their hero career began they became a part of the First Line, the foremost superhuman team of the time. They soon became some of the team's mainstays, remaining through its many incarnations. Pixie fought alongside the First Line for many years, but she never revealed her true origin, except to Oxbow. When the hero Yankee Clipper returned from his time-travels, it was Pixie who helped him adjust to the world after his 20-year absence.The First Line met their demise as they attempted to stop a Skrull invasion of Earth. Being one of the last Firstliners alive, Pixie was the one that detonated the entire fleet of invading aliens. As an Eternal, she survived the explosion and returned to Earth. It is unclear why, but Pixie stopped being a heroine and returned to Olympia, with the Eternals. She met with the Yankee Clipper, after another of his time-jumps, to explain him what happened to the First Line.Years later, Pixie and the Inhumans stopped Yeti, who was battling the X-Men at the time, revealing that he was an Inhuman. Soon after, Pixie and Ikaris stopped Angel from finding the Deviants while on a mission against the Mole Man. In the 22nd Century of Earth-700, Pixie warned Cassandra Locke's father about an upcoming Skrull invasion and helped him find a message from Cassandra hidden in the Apollo moon lander. She also claimed she had been fighting the Skrulls covertly for the last two centuries. Soon after she was arrested for sedition, accused by the Skrull Ambassador.The whereabouts of present-day Pixie are unknown.",

      "biography": "Formerly a member of the Xavier Institute's Paragons training squad, Megan Gwynn is a cheerful girl who seems to have no difficulties integrating herself with her fellow students and squad members. Nonetheless, Gwynn has shown to be a resolute and pertinacious individual both in training sessions and in the everyday interaction with other adolescents and teachers. Gwynn seems to appreciate her genetic mutation as a gift, especially enjoying her ability to fly, which she frequently exercises. The evaluation on Gwynn's potential reaction to an escalating genetic conflict remains inconclusive. While her cheerful, optimistic attitude may well motivate her to comply with government policy, her steadfast loyalty to her friends and teammates might cause her to join a potential rebellion against any sanctions on the mutant population.Later, while the New X-Men and other students were telling each other stories, precognitive student Blindfold (Ruth Aldine) recounted the story of Magik (Illyana Rasputin) and the demonic Belasco. Unbeknownst to the New X-Men, Magik had been restored to life by the Scarlet Witch's \"House of M\" reality warp. Belasco sensed Magik's presence but could not locate her after reality had been restored (M-Day). Desiring to retrieve his apprentice, he recreated a shell of Magik as Darkchild with a body and mind, but lacking a soul; Darkchild escaped into limbo while Belasco overthrew limbo’s current ruler Amanda Sefton. Detecting residual traces of Magik at Xavier's, Belasco pulled the entire Institute into limbo, leaving only Surge and Hellion behind. Learning of Belasco’s plan, Darkchild caused a small group of students to fall into the wilds of limbo. Belasco imprisoned the X-Men then relentlessly interrogated those students he had captured in order to ascertain Darkchild's location. Darkchild offered to help rescue her friends from Belasco only if Pixie gave up her soul thereby enabling Darkchild to forge a bloodstone.  Pixie consented, but due to the interference of Anole, only a portion of Pixie's soul was taken. Pixie was left tainted, as the void replacing the part of her soul was filled with black magic. The transference gave Pixie magical powers including the ability to create a shorter version of the Darkchild's Soulsword - a mystical \"Souldagger.\"  Meanwhile, Amanda Sefton teleported the Megaton Sentinel piloted by Alexander Lexington along with Surge and Hellion to Limbo to rescue their teammates. Darkchild and her student allies soon confronted Belasco, allowing the other students to liberate the imprisoned X-Men. Belasco was soon defeated, allowing Darkchild to gain control of limbo. Confronted by her \"brother\", Colossus, Darkchild returned the Institute, the X-Men and the students to Earth before planning a way to obtain more of Pixie's soul. After returning to Earth, Pixie was taught the ability to teleport, and was offered training by Doctor Strange when she grew older.\n \nPixie was among the New X-Men to battle with Mr. Sinister's Marauders and Stryker's Purifiers to save the life of the first mutant child born since “M-Day.” During that event, Pixie used her Souldagger to liberate the Marauder Malice from Omega Sentinel. Following the apparent death of Professor Xavier, Cyclops closed the Institute. But with the founding of the San Francisco base, Megan Gwynn has become a full time X-Man. Their time in San Francisco was not the peaceful one that they had expected, as a group of masked men (Later being revealed as part of a Hellfire Club led by Empath) attacked her. This led to a drastic change in her personality, as her disposition had changed over the way she sees herself as being an X-Man, and her efforts became far more attuned with those of her teammates.She now resides on Utopia, with a large bulk of the mutant community also living there.",

      "biography": "Gentry was a U.S. government weapons designer who invented an armored battlesuit coated in sharp, protective quills and outfitted with a host of concealed miniature weapons. Convinced that the government would give him virtually no credit or reward for his brilliant designs, Gentry kept the suit to himself and decided to use it for personal gain as a costumed criminal called the Porcupine, convinced that he would become the greatest super-criminal the world has ever known. His first target was a bank vault touted as impenetrable. Although Porcupine succeeded in breaking in and escaping the authorities, he caught the attention of the original Ant-Man (Hank Pym), who tracked him down with his partner, the Wasp, and defeated him, forcing him to escape. Soon after, the Porcupine sought revenge against Pym (in his new guise as Giant-Man) by infiltrating Giant-Man’s fan club to get close to him. After a long battle, Porcupine got the upper hand by seizing one of Giant-Man’s size-altering capsules. Unfortunately, Porcupine grabbed a shrinking capsule and shrunk out of sight. The effects of the gas soon wore off, and he was recruited by Doctor Doom to disrupt the wedding of the Fantastic Four. Thereafter, the Porcupine continued to pursue a long, undistinguished criminal career, always as a member of some team. He was first recruited by Count Nefaria that brought him into conflict with the X-Men, and later a member of Batroc’s Brigade and an agent of the Cowled Commander, both time fighting against Captain America. More defeats followed against the Defenders, Iron Man, the original Yellowjacket (Pym in yet another costumed identity), the Wasp, Nighthawk and Nomad.Eventually, however, Gentry grew weary of his unsuccessful criminal career and decided to sell his suit to the highest bidder so that he could retire comfortably. Unfortunately, the Porcupine had long since developed a reputation as a loser. As a result, most criminals and criminal organizations had no interest in the Porcupine armor, and the few offers Gentry did receive were insultingly low. Desperate, Gentry took the unusual approach of offering to sell his battlesuit to the Avengers for a fair price, arguing that this would prevent the suit from falling into criminal hands. Captain America, intrigued by Gentry’s offer, agreed on the condition that Gentry assist him in a sting operation aimed at capturing members of the criminal Serpent Society. Gentry reluctantly accepted the terms, but was fatally wounded in the process of helping Captain America capture several Society members. Captain America tried to console the dying Gentry by praising him for assisting in the capture of dangerous criminals, and he assured Gentry that he was a worthy opponent, but the despairing Porcupine insisted with his dying breath that he was an insignificant loser.After Gentry’s death, Captain America had the Porcupine battlesuit displayed in Avengers Mansion, labeled \"Battle Armor of the Porcupine—Honored Foe of the Avengers\". The villain Mister Hyde smashed the Porcupine display when he and the Masters of Evil invaded Mansion, but the display has since been reconstructed when the Mansion itself was restored by Ute the Watcher.",

During this time, Monica had thought her powers were burned out as a result of stopping a mutated Marrina, but she tried to confront Powderkeg by appearing in her costume and intimidating him into stopping his activities. When Powderkeg only laughed at the attempt, Monica found that some facet of her power remained, and despite her inexperience with these new powers, she defeated Powderkeg with a blow to the chin.Later, Powderkeg battled the Avengers during a failed mass escape at the prison for superhumans known as the Vault. Later still, Powderkeg was recruited to be a member of Doctor Octopus's version of the Masters of Evil. The group attempted to storm the mansion headquarters of the Avengers when the team was away on a mission.

      "biography": "David learned of his abilities, but kept them secret from his family. Frustrated at forgetting the skills he had picked up, he studied hard to try to learn all he could about them. He came into contact with Xi'an Coy Mahn at the library of the college she attended, so when Danielle Moonstar came looking for a mutant, she knew it was him. She tried to keep Danielle away from him until a local anti-mutant group called Purity targeted him, revealing to his parents that he was a mutant. After a failed attack on him by Purity, David agreed to go to Charles Xavier's school, where he became fast friends with Kevin Ford, Sofia Mantega and Laurie Collins.After a fight with the Reavers, he was roomed with Josh Foley, whom he immediately disliked because Foley was a former Reaver himself. David began to warm up to Josh, and even accompanied him and Wolfsbane on a mission to find a mutant in Salem Center. They returned with the girl, Noriko Ashida, who disliked David due to his seemingly close-minded attitude towards Josh. Eventually, David realized that he regarded Josh as a little brother, and wanted to keep him from hurting himself. As a member of the New Mutants squad, David's keen intellect allowed him to strategize and direct his teammates most effectively. Due to this, and Sofia's self-doubt about her leadership, Prodigy agreed to join her as a co-squad leader.After enduring repeated taunts by Hellion regarding his usefulness in battle, David asked Danielle and Emma to find out if he had a mental block preventing him from retaining his absorbed knowledge. They found the block, and telepathically put David through a mental scenario (though he didn't know it at the time) that showed what he would do without it, as the world's smartest man.In the scenario, David quickly outgrew the Xavier Institute and within three months cured AIDS and cancer, though it cost Elixir his life. Eighteen years later, David was married to Noriko and President of the United States. All countries except China had joined the U.S., and David was planning to drop nuclear bombs across all of China. When Danielle confronted him, he killed her, and blew up the X-Men on a satellite. The surviving New Mutants joined the terrorist Hellions and attacked the White House, but Prodigy, Sage and the X.S.E. killed them all except Surge, who overloaded her gauntlets and blew herself and David to bits.After seeing the potential damage his full power could do, David decided not to remove his mental block. Since then he felt very awkward around Surge, and tried to avoid her. After the semester he contemplated leaving the Institute altogether. However, Sofia managed to get the team to talk about their interpersonal problems and he stayed. During this time David created a \"Danger Cave\" with skills gleaned from Beast and others. The room, situated in the old Morlock tunnels, was equipped with holographic projectors linked to a database of the X-Men's greatest missions. His teammates could be \"clothed\" to match the X-Men members and other people from those missions. Following House of M|M-Day, David was de-powered and was going to go home, but before doing so, he showed his friends the Danger Cave. Fortunately he was not on the bus that was blown up by Stryker. However, his parents didn't really want him to come home, so he ended up with nowhere to go and stayed in the Institute.David and several students listened to a story told by Blindfold, about [[Magik (Illyana Rasputin)|Magik, a deceased member of the original New Mutants. The group is suddenly taken to another dimesion called limbo by the demon who trained Magik, Belasco. David is questioned by Belasco about Magik When told she is dead, Belasco kills David by ripping out his heart but Josh was able to restore him due to the information he had obtained from Beast's brain. David notices that Belasco had put helmets on Stepford Cuckoos and Martha that blocked their telepathic powers. As Mercury and Dust continue to battle Belasco, he has Josh boost a heavily injured X-23's healing factor. X-23 uses her claws to release the psychics. The Cuckoos launch a telepathic attack on Belasco and they discover that Belasco had captured and lost two other innocent women before, and that Belasco loved Illyana and wanted her innocent soul not for power or revenge but for love. The Cuckoos are forced out of Belasco's mind but Belasco is defeated by Pixie and the Darkchild (Belasco's soulless recreation of Magik) before he could pull Earth into Limbo. When the students returned to the Mansion with the help of the other X-Men, david is greeted by Surge by seeing her kiss Hellion telling David that she no longer loved him and did not want him to remain at the mansion. When confronted by the Stepford Cuckoos they offer him a chance to regain all of the past abilities he had before M-Day. By removing his mental blocks David once again had acess to all the information he had absorbed before his powers were taken away, at a meeting with the other X-Men David was then named substitute instructor.When the first Mutant baby scince M-Day was born many enemies of the X-Men went after it, Surge leaded the New X-Men into battle against the purifiers though David declines participating seeing the battle as revenge and not beneficial, when the New X-men returned to the Mansion with a mortally wounded Hellion and the mansion under attack by Sentinel Squad O*N*E David assisted Beast in stabilizing all of the injured students and faculty.",

      "biography": "Ritchie was the leader of his college wrestling team but still he felt like something was missing in his life. One day an old vigilante named Black Marvel approached Ritchie and made him a offer that he couldn't refuse. Black Marvel offered him the chance to become a hero and he accepted the offer almost immediately. Black Marvel also acquired help of three other youngsters and named them Slingers. Costumes and aliases that Black Marvel gave to the heroes were once owned by Spider-Man. The Slingers had several training exercises and on one of those exercises Dusk got killed by falling to her death from a roof. Other team members Ricochet and Hornet was devastated but Ritchie now known as Prodigy told them to move on and leave her.Sometime later the Slingers were told to do some scouting in a construction yard that they thought to be Maggia's cover operation. Prodigy told Ricochet and Hornet to go check it out. They discovered that Maggia was storing nuclear waste under the building. When they were to report this to Prodigy they were attacked by giant mutated rats. Prodigy himself was in the construction yard trying to be unseen when Ricochet contacted him and the guards near by heard it. They opened fire on him but thanks to his bulletproof costume he soon took care of the goons. At that exact moment Ricochet accidentally made the tunnel collapse and Hornet was buried under the rubble. Ricochet tried to contact Prodigy but he decided not to answer and crushed the phone. He then left thinking to himself that they would just bring him down with them.Prodigy went back to Black Marvel and reported that Hornet and Ricochet were dead. Prodigy was told the next job and he and Black Marvel took off. Prodigy was waiting for Black Marvel's sign to start when Ricochet and Hornet tried to tell him the truth of Black Marvel. Prodigy didn't want to listen and attacked Hornet. Ricochet and Prodigy fought for a while. Prodigy eventually bound Ricochet, but Hornet recovered and attacked him accidentally knocking Ricochet off a balcony. Hornet was going to jump and save him but Prodigy crabbed his leg and threw him through a window. Hornet was severely injured and managed to tell Prodigy that he was in the wrong place and that something was about to happen in the basement. Then some of Maggia goons appeared and opened fire at the heroes. Hornet dove to cover while Prodigy threw a table at them; he then snatched one of them and almost killed him but was stopped by Hornet. Prodigy then went through the floor and headed toward the basement. Soon after Black Marvel pressed a remote control and several explosives detonated in the hotel. After the explosions Prodigy headed to the ballroom and found Black Marvel, Hornet, Ricochet, and Dusk. The others tried to convince Prodigy that Black Marvel was behind the explosions. Then Dusk informed them that there were still people in the hotel that needed help and teleported Ricochet and Hornet away leaving Prodigy and Black Marvel behind. Prodigy was about to go save the people, but was threatened by Black Marvel. Prodigy tried to take a swing at him but Black Marvel escaped leaving him standing there alone in flaming ballroom. They saved several people from the fire and Ricochet managed to arrest Black Marvel. Meanwhile Hornet was saving a child who became stranded in a burning elevator shaft. The boy was climbing down when a bomb in the elevator exploded hurling him down and hitting Hornet in the chest. Hornet crashed to the bottom of the elevator shaft saving the boy but would have been crushed under the collapsing building if Prodigy had not stopped the derbies. He then told Hornet to get the boy out of there. Hornet got the kid out but Prodigy got buried under the collapsing building.The others thought that he was dead but days later he managed to dig himself out. He then fought a gang to save a young girl who was stabbed. Prodigy managed to get her to the hospital. He then went to find Ricochet and joined the others once again. After the reunion they were transported to hell by Mephisto and he informed them that they would have to fight for Black Marvel's soul. The others were going to leave but Hornet convinced them that they couldn't leave his soul to him. Mephisto used their biggest fears against them and in a last effort had his armies attack them. Dusk amazed everybody by taking out several minions with just one attack. They fought for a while and managed to free his soul. They were then transported back to Earth to the roof where this all started. Prodigy then apologized for everything he made them go trough and left.Prodigy resurfaced when the Civil War|Superhuman Registration Act became a law. He was in a drunken state shouting on rooftop when Iron Man appeared informing him that he was breaking a law and asking him to surrender. In his drunken state Prodigy called him a traitor and attacked. In the ensuing fight they wrecked the neighborhood. The fight ended when Iron Man hurled Prodigy into a nearby rooftop knocking him out. S.H.I.E.L.D. agents then came to take him in custody. Reporter Ben Urich, his colleague Sally Floyd and several other bystanders witnessed this scene. Prodigy was then known as the first victim of the Superhuman Registration Act.Prodigy was later freed from the Negative Zone's Prison Alpha by Captain America and his Avengers. He then fought beside them against Iron Man's forces and both sides wrecked havoc in middle of New York. The battle ended when Captain America surrendered to authorities. Prodigy was once again captured and put to jail.Still he later repented and agreed to sign the act as he was fed up being in jail and was sent to the Initiative training program. He was also forced to admit that he had an alleged drinking problem in front of several reporters including Sally Floyd from the Front Line and that he was getting treatments for it. He has still stated his distaste towards the registration act several times after and before that press release. In the first couple days in the program Prodigy already managed to convince the other fellow trainees Annex, Gorilla Girl, Batwing, Boulder and Sunstreak to go awol. They stole a hum wee and used Boulder, who has the power of invulnerability, to get through the base defenses. They were soon noticed to be missing and Yellowjacket, War Machine, Constrictor and their drill instructor Taskmaster went after them but where ambushed by King Cobra, Mister Hyde, Mauler and Firebrand who were hired to kill Taskmaster. Seeing this Prodigy and the other trainees went to help them and with their compined effort managed to drive them away.",

      "biography": "Charles Francis Xavier was born the son of nuclear researcher Brian Xavier and his wife, Sharon. Following her husband's accidental death, Sharon married Brian's colleague, Kurt Marko. Cain, Kurt's son by a previous marriage, came to live at the Xavier’s Westchester mansion shortly thereafter. A cruel and spiteful boy, he bullied his new stepbrother. As punishment, his father secretly beat him - and young Charles felt his sibling's pain firsthand thanks to the emergence of his mutant telepathic powers. Following their mother’s death, a fire in the family home took Kurt’s life, leaving the stepbrothers alone.\n\nBy the time he graduated high school, Charles was completely bald as a side effect of his mutant nature. He entered Bard College in New York at age 16 and earned his bachelor's degree in biology within two years. He was then accepted into the graduate-studies program at England's prestigious Oxford University, where he earned degrees in genetics and biophysics. There, Charles met and fell in love with a young Scotswoman named Moira Kinross. Their passionate discussions on the subject of genetic mutation gave way to romance, and they planned to marry. Their only obstacle was Moira's former boyfriend, Joe MacTaggert, a lance corporal in the Royal Marines and a bully, just like Cain. In Joe's eyes, Charles was a good-for-nothing intellectual, so Charles enlisted in the military after completing his studies at Oxford to validate himself in terms his rival would understand.\n\nCharles quickly became something of a legend in the area of search and rescue thanks to his mutant abilities. Attached to the same unit as his stepbrother, Charles was present when Cain deserted under fire during a mission in Asia. Following him in the hope of convincing him to return to their unit, Charles witnessed Cain's discovery of the mystical Ruby of Cyttorak and his transformation into the superhuman Juggernaut. Charles escaped the subsequent cave-in, mistakenly believing his stepbrother was dead.\n\nLater, Charles was devastated when Moira broke off their engagement without explanation. He left the Army and began traveling the world. In Cairo, Egypt, he encountered Amahl Farouk, a mutant capable of summoning forth the darkness in the souls of others. This confrontation led to Charles' decision to devote his life to protecting humanity from evil mutants and saving innocent mutants from human oppression.\n\nCharles next traveled to Israel, where he fell in love with Israeli diplomat Gabrielle Haller. He also befriended a fellow drifter named Erik Magnus Lehnsherr, a fellow mutant who would become his greatest enemy: Magneto, self-styled master of magnetism. Whilst Charles optimistically believed that humans and mutants could coexist, the Jewish Magnus foresaw mutants as the new minority to be persecuted and hunted because of their differences. Together, the pair prevented the nefarious Baron Von Strucker from launching his terrorist group Hydra on an unsuspecting world. Magnus departed with Strucker's gold, and upon departing Israel himself, Charles was unaware that Haller was pregnant with his son, David.\n\nEn route to the United States, Charles encountered the alien scout Lucifer in the Himalayas. To prevent any interference in his race’s planned invasion of Earth, Lucifer dropped a massive stone block on Charles, crippling his legs. In desperation, Charles called out with his mental powers and touched the mind of a young mutant named Tessa who was operating as a mercenary in the neighboring Hindu Kush mountains. Tessa came to his aid and Charles was airlifted to safety. During his convalescence in an Indian hospital, Charles met Amelia Voght, a young nurse who fell in love with him and renewed his will to live.\n\nCharles resumed graduate work at Columbia University in New York, and after receiving a Ph.D. in anthropology he spent several years in London earning a M.D. in psychiatry. There, Charles renewed his friendship with Moira, who had married Joe MacTaggert and was now a renowned geneticist. The two began discussing the idea of founding a school for mutants.\n\nCharles returned to America and resumed his studies of mutation, working alongside Doctor Karl Lykos, a mutant whom would one day become the creature named Sauron. During this time, Professor John Grey, a friend of Charles' from Bard College, brought his young daughter Jean to Charles for help. Jean had been traumatized when she telepathically experienced the death of a friend. Charles aided in her recovery, and in the ensuing years trained her to use her mental powers. Charles later met with Fred Duncan, an F.B.I. agent investigating the growing number of mutants. Charles told Duncan of his plan to locate young mutants and enroll them in a school using his ancestral mansion home as a base to train them to use their powers for humanity's benefit. Amelia remained with Charles until the young mutant Scott Summers joined the school. She left, fearing an escalating genetic arms race between Charles and Magnus. Over the following months, Charles used the mutant-locating computer Cerebro to assemble his original group of students: Cyclops, Iceman, Angel, Beast, and Jean, who took the name Marvel Girl. He dubbed his students the \"X-Men,\" because each possessed an \"extra\" ability that normal humans lacked. Charles also recruited Tessa at this time, but kept her presence at the mansion a secret from his other students as he planned to use her talents as a spy.\n\nSoon after, Charles learned of a planned invasion of Earth by the alien Z'nox, and theorized that he would have to link the minds of the majority of morally upright people on Earth to stop the invaders. However, he needed time in virtual isolation to prepare his mind for such an awesome task. To that end, Charles had the mutant shape-changer named Changeling impersonate him so that his students, except for Jean to whom he entrusted his plan, would remain none the wiser. After Changeling died on a mission with the team, Charles allowed the X-Men to believe he was dead. Months later, Charles revealed his deception to his students and repelled the invaders. The X-Men and the superhuman adventurers known as the Fantastic Four then traveled into space and defeated the aliens.\n\nYears later, when his original students were captured by the sentient island-being Krakoa, Charles recruited Banshee, Colossus, Nightcrawler, Storm, Sunfire, and Wolverine as a new team to rescue them. Afterwards, Cyclops was the only original member to remain and help Charles train the new recruits. Before long, Charles began to experience psychic nightmares from an alien world. These images were sent by Lilandra, princess of the intergalactic Shi'ar Empire, who was seeking assistance to defeat her mad brother D'Ken. In the course of the ensuing struggle, Charles and Lilandra fell in love, and for a time he lived on Chandilar, the Shi'ar throneworld, as her consort.\n\nCharles and Lilandra spent much time together on Earth before her coronation, and during this time the X-Men fought Magneto in Antarctica. After the battle, most of the team made it to the hidden jungle in the icy wasteland known as the Savage Land. Phoenix and Beast returned to Westchester, believing the rest of the team had died. Heartbroken, Charles accompanied Lilandra to the Shi'ar homeworld for her coronation. When he learned that the rest of the X-Men were actually alive, he returned to Earth.\n\nSome time later, Lilandra faced a coup by her sister Deathbird and the insectoid alien Brood race. The X-Men and the space pirates known as the Starjammers helped defeat them, but Charles had been implanted with a Brood egg which would ultimately hatch and transform him into the Brood's new queen. When Charles tried to probe the implant he was sent into a coma, and after he awoke he learned the X-Men had been captured by the Brood and taken into space. Fearing his students dead, and under subconscious commands from the larval Brood within him, Charles gathered a new group of young superhuman students he named the New Mutants. Following the X-Men’s return, the queen hatched and transformed Charles into a Brood. Although his body was destroyed, with the X-Men's help, Charles was able to retain mental control of the Brood Queen long enough for the Starjammers' physician Sikorsky to clone him a new body with no disabilities. It was some time before Charles could walk again due to the psychosomatic pain of being crippled for so long.\n\nEventually, Charles began to take his most active role ever with the X-Men by accompanying them on missions. During this time, Gabrielle requested Charles’ help in treating her son David, the powerful psionic mutant known as Legion who suffered from multiple personality disorder. Charles learned that David was his child, and helped him emerge from his autistic condition.\n\nCharles' cloned body eventually began to deteriorate, and he was forced to leave Earth with Lilandra and the Starjammers to heal. He left the school in the seemingly reformed Magneto's care, joining Lilandra in the fight to regain her rightful place on the Shi'ar throne. After an extended sojourn in space, Charles returned to Earth and both the original and second teams of X-Men reassembled under his leadership to battle his old enemy Farouk, now calling himself the Shadow King. Charles’ spine was broken in the ensuing battle, leaving him crippled and confined to a wheelchair once more.\n\nSince the X-Men were all now highly trained adults, Charles renamed his school as the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning. He also assumed control of a private institution, the Massachusetts Academy, and transformed it into a new School for Gifted Youngsters. There, yet another new crop of young mutants, Generation X, learned to use their budding superhuman abilities, with Banshee and Emma Frost as headmasters.\n\nCharles' next major confrontation came when Magneto initiated a lethal electromagnetic pulse inside Earth's atmosphere. Charles and his X-Men took the fight to Magneto's orbital base and, in the ensuing battle, Magneto viciously attacked Wolverine, forcibly extracting the metal that had been bonded to his skeleton from his body. Seeing no other alternative, Charles used his mental powers to shut down Magneto's conscious mind. During this desperate act, the evil portion of Magneto's psyche implanted itself within Charles' mind. This evil aspect, combined with the darkest part of Charles' soul, gained sentience as the powerful psionic being known as Onslaught.\n\nAfter a pitched battle, America's greatest super heroes narrowly defeated Onslaught. To ensure that Charles never again spawned such a being, the United States government took him into custody. Although Charles was willing to pay the price for his folly, he was appalled when the government turned him over to the custody of Bastion, head of the anti-mutant Operation: Zero Tolerance. After Zero Tolerance was shut down, the X-Men set out to search for their missing founder. When they finally located him, Charles was leading a new incarnation of the Brotherhood of Mutants in an attempt to defeat a now-sentient Cerebro. Charles ultimately defeated Cerebro by showing him the unique importance of each living individual.\n\nCharles subsequently returned to the X-Men, but soon after disbanded the team over fears a member of the shape-shifting alien race known as the Skrulls had infiltrated them. After Wolverine was seemingly killed in battle, it was revealed that it was actually a Skrull impersonating him who had died, thus proving Charles' theory correct. The X-Men reformed in time to foil the plans of the eternal mutant Apocalypse, who sought to rule the world by using the power of the Twelve -- a fabled team of mutants, including Charles and Magneto, who were destined to usher in a new golden age for their kind. After Apocalypse was defeated, Charles departed Earth with Cadre K, a team of adolescent mutant Skrulls, to help them find a new home.\n\nCharles returned to the X-Men to lead them once more, but was captured by Magneto who had been amassing an army on the island nation of Genosha in preparation for an all-out war against humanity. The X-Men rescued their founder, and Magneto was himself crippled by Wolverine. Soon after, Genosha’s population was obliterated by giant mutant-hunting robotic Sentinels sent by Charles’ malevolent genetic twin sister, Cassandra Nova. Charles found himself powerless against his sister after she switched bodies with him, trapping his mind in her own dying form. In Charles’ body, Nova publicly outed him as a mutant and then left Earth with Lilandra whom she convinced to order the Shi'ar's superhuman Imperial Guard to destroy all mutants on Earth. After a pitched battle with the X-Men during which Nova's deception was revealed, Jean Grey absorbed Charles’ consciousness into her own mind, then used the new mutant-locating Cerebra device to hide pieces of it in the minds of every mutant on Earth. When Nova went to use Cerebra to kill all of Earth's mutants, she unwittingly reformed Charles’ consciousness and he forced her out of his body. Once Nova was defeated, Xorn, the X-Men’s newest member, healed Charles’ body.\n\nFree of having to hide behind a veil of secrecy, Charles took to his now public role as a mutant rights activist with vigor. He opened his school to mutants everywhere, and the X-Men became the new faculty. It was not long, however, before Charles’ world came crashing down around him after it was revealed that Xorn was seemingly Magneto in disguise. His old nemesis had survived the Genoshan holocaust and infiltrated the X-Men, gathering together a class of students to use as his new soldiers for the war against mankind. Xorn crippled Charles once more and took control of New York City, rechristening it New Genosha. Using a neurotoxic drug known as Kick to boost his powers, Xorn planned to reverse the magnetic poles of the Earth, destroying humanity and ushering in a new age for mutantkind. However, his students rebelled, and the timely arrival of the X-Men saw a permanent end to his plans after Wolverine decapitated him.\n\nDisillusioned, Charles left the Institute in the care of the X-Men and traveled to Genosha to supposedly give Magneto a proper burial. Wolverine accompanied Charles, and the two argued over their differing opinions of Magneto. Wolverine left on less than friendly terms, leaving Charles to help rebuild the shattered mutant nation alongside the true Magneto, who was revealed to be alive and well and living on the island. Shortly thereafter, Wanda Maximoff went insane and killed several of the Avengers. Magneto retrieved her and begged Xavier to treat her. He tried, but even with the help of Doctor Strange, Xavier was unable to expel her insanity. While the X-men and the Avengers met with Xavier to discuss her fate, Quicksilver convinced Wanda to alter reality with her powers. Wanda did, altered reality into the House of M, a world where mutants were the majority, humans the minority and Magneto was their ruler. In this alternate reality, Magneto and the others believed that Xavier died years ago helping free Genosha from the homo sapiens fascists. Eventually, the plot was unveiled, and Wanda used her magic once more, reverting the world as it had been, with one major exception: ninety-eight percent of the mutant population had lost their powers, leaving the mutant race on the brink of extinction.\n\nWith reality restored, Xavier was still missing and the X-Men were unable to locate him with Cerebro. Many assumed the worst. Xavier returned when Vulcan attacked the X-Men, revealing that Wanda had given him control of his legs, with the exchange being that he was no longer a mutant. Under Vulcan's orders, Xavier revealed that he had sent a team of young mutants to their deaths to Krakoa when his original X-Men were captured. After Vulcan was dispatched of, Cyclops told Xavier that he was no longer welcome at the Xavier Mansion.\n\nXavier still remained at the mansion disregarding Cyclops' orders only to aid in assisting Beast in his analysis of Darwin, though the tension between him and Cyclops was palpable. He started to try contacting the Shi'ar Empire, to see if Vulcan had arrived, but got only dead air. The best they could do was make a machine that would send them a message every 30 minutes. To help him deal with the results of his years-old misjudgment, he asked Havok, Polaris, Warpath, Nightcrawler,and Marvel Girl to join him on a quest to the Shi'ar Galaxy to stop Vulcan. In spite of Cyclops' feelings, Xavier traveled to space to confront Vulcan before he could enact his vengeance against the Shi'ar empire. While en route to the Shi'ar homeworld, he was abducted by agents of the Shi'ar Vice Chancellor K'Tor.",

      "biography": "Charles Xavier is one of the world's premiere experts on mutants. A mutant telepath, Charles and his wife Moira MacTaggert wrote the book on post-human medicine, treating young mutants endangered by their own powers. Their mutant son David was born a few years into their marriage, but Charles never felt close to him. He had a strong bond with Erik Lensherr, the first adult mutant he ever met. As Charles and Moira drifted apart, Charles abandoned his family and helped Erik establish the Brotherhood of Mutants. Charles gradually realized Erik, now calling himself Magneto, didn't share his goal of peaceful coexistence with humanity. When Charles and his allies fled the Brotherhood, Magneto impaled Charles with a metal spear, severing his spine. As the Brotherhood turned to terrorism, Charles worked to oppose them. Offered funding for a mutant school and hospital by the Hellfire Club, Charles asked Moira to take charge of the latter, ensuring that his sickly son David had constant treatment. At some point, Charles romanced his adult student Emma Frost, who eventually left him after arguing against what she viewed as plans to turn his students into soldiers. When the government launched the robotic anti-mutant Sentinels in response to the Brotherhood's terrorism, Charles sent his new students, the X-Men, to save mutants from the killer robots. The X-Men rescued the President's kidnapped daughter from the Brotherhood, winning Presidential favor, which was augmented when they saved Washington from destruction and Charles apparently slew Magneto.  Charles secretly spared Erik, rendering him an amnesiac in the hope of eventual rehabilitation. When David went on a murderous rampage, Charles found himself unable to kill his son, so Colossus, one of his X-Men, did it for him. Feeling himself a failure for letting down both David and his student Iceman (whom David hospitalized), Charles nearly disbanded the X-Men. Apparent progress with Magneto's rehabilitation convinced him to persevere. Tragically, Magneto later regained his memories and returned to terrorism. Suspected of collusion because he had lied about Magneto's demise, Xavier was captured by the Ultimates and imprisoned in Camp X-Factor in Guantanamo Bay. Later freed in a Brotherhood raid, he coordinated efforts to contain a nuclear power plant meltdown Magneto instigated, publicly redeeming himself. The X-Men were allowed to continue under S.H.I.E.L.D. jurisdiction.",

      "biography": "Hobie Brown was a talented kid to whom no one would listen. Despite his obvious talent at design and invention, people looked down on him whenever he suggested something new and innovative. Instead of getting work where his talents were useful, he was a window washer. Finally, to prove his ability, he turned to crime. He designed a costume with a number of tricks and went out to steal the payroll of The Daily Bugle as the Prowler. His plan was to return the money as Hobie Brown, to become a hero, and most important of all, to impress his girlfriend, Mindy.The Prowler's foray into the criminal world was a disaster. He was caught stealing the payroll by Peter Parker. During the confrontation, Parker was accidentally sent hurtling through a window. Although he used his spider powers to save himself, Hobie was left in anguish, thinking that he was a murderer. In order to redeem himself, the Prowler lured Spider-Man to a fight at a jewelry store, hoping to defeat him. When he failed, Spider-Man unmasked him and heard Hobie's story. Spider-Man let him go, believing that the Prowler was through with crime. Later, Spider-Man sought out Hobie to ask for a favor. He asked Hobie to pose as Spider-Man in order to deliver a message to Peter Parker. Hobie agreed and used his special equipment to complete the impersonation, unaware that Parker had accidentally revealed his secret identity when suffering the effects of a fever, and this was part of his plan to convince his friends otherwise.  When Spider-Man was implicated in the death of Captain George Stacy, Hobie assumed the Prowler identity in hopes of bringing Spider-Man to justice. However, Spider-Man quickly overpowered him, and at the conclusion of the battle, saved him from falling down an elevator shaft. Hobie remained convinced that Spider-Man was not a murderer and gave up pursuing him. Hobie eventually married his love, Mindy, and settled down into a career as a construction worker. He did not entirely abandoned the Prowler identity, however; he became the Prowler when his \"little brother\" of the Big Brother program was reportedly killed by the original White Tiger. Desperate for justice, the two fought each other until discovering the true killer was a night watchman who tried to break up a gang fight. The two even applied for membership with the Defenders, but were outclassed. This prompted Hobie to abandon his Prowler identity for a time. The criminal called simply the Cat (Cat Burglar) discovered Hobie's hidden costume and weapons, using them to become the Prowler and commit crimes on behalf of the original Belladonna. The two were soon apprehended by Spider-Man, though. When his wife Mindy took a new job as a bookkeeper for a subsidiary of Justin Hammer, she was set up to take the fall for some suspicious stock deals. The Prowler tracked evidence that could clear his wife to Los Angeles, where he teamed up with Spider-Man to retrieve the evidence. Mindy was cleared of all charges. Later, Spider-Man was accused of theft by The Daily Bugle during efforts to incriminate criminal recluse Winston Walker by the international mercenary Silver Sable. Prowler teamed up with the Rocket Racer to exonerate Spider-Man, and ended up in battle against the Sandman. The battle was finally cut short by Spider-Man, and as the truth came to light, Silver Sable offered Prowler freelance work with her mercenary organization. Hobie agreed, and helped Silver Sable on occasion, teaming up with Sandman, Rocket Racer, and others as the team called the Outlaws.Hobie found an engineering job at a company who was interested in his pneumatic technology. However, a new vigilante appeared on the streets of New York with a costume and weapons nearly identical to the Prowler's. Hobie investigated as the Prowler, clashing with the Nightcreeper, who turned out to have stolen the weapons from Hobie's company. The Nightcreeper's vendetta stemmed from his daughter's death as a result of a drive-by shooting, and he was committed that all criminals should pay. At the same time, both vigilantes were accosted by the Vulture (Adrian Toomes), who had bought out the company in his attempts to pursue more white-collar crime. The Vulture attacked both, leaving Nightcreeper hospitalized and the Prowler only a little worse off. Ultimately, though, the Prowler was able to drive the Vulture off and expose his plans. Mindy, his wife, had discovered the truth of her husband's identity during this time, and although she was upset, she remained tolerant of her husband's activities. Desperate for some extra cash, Hobie and Rocket Racer became involved in the Great Game, a competition played by wealthy sponsors who would wager that their superhuman agents would defeat specific targets. However, the Game may have proved too high-stakes, as the Prowler broke his back in the final rumble, becoming paralyzed. During his hospitalization, a new Prowler appeared, committing crimes for petty cash.  He was immediately targeted for revenge by the Vulture and was barely saved by Spider-Man. It was in fact a hospital worker, Rick Lawson, who learned of Hobie’s identity and stole his costume. He planned on robbing victims’ homes while they were in the hospital. The Vulture returned to nearly eviscerate Rick Lawson, and only the timely arrival of Spider-Man helped save him. Hobie recovered from his injury, but never again assumed the Prowler identity. When Spider-Man was framed for murder and increased pressure was placed on capturing him, he turned to Hobie for help in creating a new crime-fighting identity in order to investigate the fraudulent claims. Hobie provided Spider-Man with a cybernetic jet-pack, which was used in creating the Hornet costume. During the superhuman Civil War|civil war Hobie went unregistered and was able to evade capture thanks to tips from Arachne (Julia Carpenter) but was eventually brought in by Ms. Marvel. In Custody, S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives threatened to accuse his wife of being an unauthorized adventurer unless he would inform them of the double agent in their ranks. The Prowler escaped during a massive prison breakout and is still unregistered. He attended Stilt-Man's wake and revealed that the Stilt-Man had inspired him to invent his Prowler costume. Puma escorted him out before the Punisher bombed the wake. It's unrevealed if Hobie was poisoned by the drinks the Punisher served at the wake.",

      "biography": "Betsy Braddock was Sir James Braddock's second child, and like her twin brother Brian, her life was secretly manipulated by Merlyn. The twins shared a close connection, but as they matured the adventurous Betsy also grew close to their elder brother Jamie. By the time their parents died, apparently in a lab accident but really murdered by the computer Mastermind, Betsy had become a charter pilot. When Mastermind's agent Doctor Synne tried to kill Jamie, a concerned Betsy fetched Brian, but as she flew them home, Synne's psychic attack caused her to crash. When she awoke, Synne's illusions made Betsy attack her brothers, seeing them as monsters. After Synne was defeated she and Jamie were taken hostage by the Red Skull's agents. Freed by Captains America and Britain, Betsy learned the latter was her brother Brian. Perhaps because of Synne's mental intrusions, Betsy began to develop precognitive powers. She took up modeling, while her powers grew to include telepathy. Agent Matthew recruited Betsy into S.T.R.I.K.E.'s Psi Division, and she became fellow psi Tom Lennox's lover. Because her father had been a member, she was sent to infiltrate the Hellfire Club, but was warned off by Tessa for her own protection.When the crimelord Vixen secretly usurped S.T.R.I.K.E., she hired Slaymaster to eliminate the Psi-Division before they could expose this. The telepaths fled, but Slaymaster continued to pick them off; only a handful were left when Betsy sensed Brian's return and called on his help. He defeated Slaymaster and the three surviving psi's (Betsy, Tom and Alison Double) moved into the holographically hidden Braddock Manor. In short succession this hideout was found by the Special Executive, Captain U.K. and the Fury; as the last of these battled Brian and the Executive, Betsy foresaw a future where superhumans were imprisoned in concentration camps. Soon the U.K. became a fascist state ruled by the insane reality warper Sir James Jaspers, with S.T.R.I.K.E. \"Beetle\" squads rounding up those with powers. While Brian confronted Jaspers, the Beetles found the others' hideout. Tom died trying to buy his friends time to escape; Betsy was in Tom's mind when he died, and was captured. After being freed, she was nursed back to health by fellow camp inmate Victoria Bentley, who taught her to use her experiences to strengthen her powers. When Kaptain Briton, Brian's Earth-794 counterpart, tried to rape her, Betsy fried his mind, killing him. The same night, Mastermind informed the twins of their father's non-terrestrial origins, and the Resources Control Executive (R.C.X.) asked them to billet Warpies, children transformed by Jaspers' warp, at the Manor. One of the R.C.X. agents was Matthew, now codenamed Gabriel. Betsy overruled Brian and let R.C.X. and the Warpies move in. When Brian went overseas, Gabriel convinced Betsy to become the new Captain Britain, wearing Kaptain Briton's modified costume. Working with Captain U.K. (Linda McQuillan), the duo became public sensations, but after several months Betsy went solo. Vixen lured her into a showdown with Slaymaster, who brutally beat her, then gouged her eyes out. Brian felt her pain, flew to her rescue and killed Slaymaster. Betsy refused R.C.X.'s offer of cybernetic eyes, preferring to rely on her psychic abilities; she and Gabriel got engaged, and went to Switzerland for Betsy to recuperate. Betsy was kidnapped from the Alps by Mojo, brainwashed, given cybernetic eyes, and, as \"Psylocke,\" became the star of his new show \"Wildways.\" Brian and the New Mutants rescued her, after which Betsy moved to the X-Men's mansion to recover, exactly where Roma (Merlyn's daughter) needed her to be. When the Marauders attacked the Morlocks, and Sabretooth invaded the mansion, she used herself as bait to lead him away from the injured until Wolverine got there. Impressed by her bravery, Wolverine nominated her to join the X-Men, beside whom she met Mephisto, Dr. Doom, the Fantastic Four, and Horde. The X-Men later battled Freedom Force and the Adversary in Dallas, and, in a televised battle, sacrificed themselves to allow Forge to bind the Adversary; Roma secretly restored them to life, and gave Betsy the Siege Perilous, which they could use if they ever wanted to start new lives. The X-Men moved to the Reavers' Australian Outback base, from where they took on the Brood Boys, Genoshan Magistrates, M Squad, Mr. Jip, the Serpent Society, the Abomination, Master Mold, Nimrod, Nanny, the Orphan-Maker, Zaladane and the Savage Land Mutates. As they were about to depart the Savage Land, Betsy had a precognitive flash of the Reavers killing the team. To prevent this, she sent them through the Siege Perilous.Betsy reappeared amnesiac on an island near China, where the Hand found her. Matsu'o Tsurayaba, their leader, saw a chance to save his brain-dead lover, Kwannon, and had Spiral's Body Shoppe swap their souls. This inadvertently blended their minds, leaving each with the same memories and telepathic powers. Tsurayaba brainwashed Psylocke and gave her to the Mandarin as his assassin, Lady Mandarin, until Wolverine restored her memories. Back with the X-Men Betsy took on Cameron Hodge, Warskrulls, the Shadow King and cosmic cleaner Edifice Rex; she also informed Brian she was alive. The next few months saw battles against Magneto, Fenris, Mys-Tech (alongside new ally Dark Angel), and a Brood-infected Ghost Rider. Visiting Brian, Betsy helped Excalibur fight Sat-Yr-9 and the now insane Jamie, whom Betsy struck comatose. Encounters followed with the Troll Associates, the Mutant Liberation Front, Stryfe, Omega Red, and the Soul Skinner.Then Kwannon arrived at the Mansion in Betsy's original body, claiming to be the real Psylocke. Unable to discern which was truly Betsy, both stayed with the X-Men, maintaining an uneasy coexistence, with Kwannon taking the name Revanche. Learning she had the Legacy Virus, Revanche had Matsu'o kill her, after which Betsy regained her soul's missing piece. Having become involved with her teammate Angel, the following months saw her fight the Phalanx, try to reach Jamie's comatose mind, battle Legion in Israel, and combat Gene Nation. When Sabretooth gutted Psylocke, Angel, Wolverine, Doctor Strange and Gomurr the Ancient retrieved a magical liquid from the Crimson Dawn dimension which healed her and gave her new powers, but also marked her with a red tattoo over her left eye. Kuragari, Proctor of the Crimson Dawn, tried to claim Betsy as his bride, but was thwarted with Gomurr and Angel's aid, freeing Betsy of the Dawn's influence. Subsequently she aided Storm against the Shadow King, who tricked Psylocke into initiating a psychic shockwave which disabled all other telepaths, leaving him unchallenged on the astral plane. Her own astral form was destroyed, but her exposure to the Crimson Dawn gave her a new shadow form with temporarily enhanced powers, which she used to trap the Shadow King's core. To keep him trapped she was forced to constantly focus her telepathy on him, effectively rendering herself powerless. After attending Brian's wedding, she was kidnapped to take part in the Coterie's contest of champions. When Apocalypse and his Horsemen sought to gather the Twelve, Psylocke used Cerebro to boost her powers, so that she could use them and still keep the Shadow King imprisoned, allowing her to free the brainwashed Wolverine. Jean Grey's attempt to help Betsy deal with the Shadow King somehow swapped their powers, leaving Betsy telekinetic. With her new abilities Betsy fought Belasco, the Neo, the Goth, and the Prime Sentinels, then aided her brother freeing Otherworld from Mastermind's Warpie army.After ending her relationship with Archangel, Betsy joined Storm's X-Men team in the search for Destiny's Diaries. In Valencia, Spain, they encountered the enigmatic Vargas who killed her. Later, in a dream, Bishop saw Betsy's spirit being snatched by a skulled figure. Much later, Betsy was returned alive to the site of her death. Reunited with the X-Men, she helped them against the Saurian Hauk'ka, Mojo and Spiral. She has also been reunited with Brian during a recent reality storm. It is now known that her brother, Jamie, had brought her back to life to fight a great evil and had reconstructed her to be immune to attacks meant to control her mind, reshape her body, or affect her basic quantum structure. Recently, she has joined the dimension hopping group, the Exiles.",

      "biography": "Born in 1914, Eugene Milton Judd grew to be a swashbuckling soldier of fortune. There seemed no adventure too big for the tall, handsome, powerfully built adventurer. One adventure led him to pursue the fabled Black Blade of Baghdad. Becoming fascinated with the mystic blade, he kept it for himself upon finding it rather than turn it over to his patrons. However, in touching the blade, he released the Earth-bound spirit named Raazer (a.k.a. Black Raazer) that was contained within it. Apparently it was as much Judd's dishonest thoughts as his touch that released the sorcerer. Raazer had been imprisoned in the blade long ago by his fellow Persian sorcerers to prevent him from killing any more people with the Black Blade, which had originally been a gleaming white scimitar before his evil had corrupted it over the centuries. Raazer began stealing parts of Judd’s life-force, passing his blade through him, and in the process reducing him in height. Before he could die, however, Judd fought back against Raazer, using the light of his own soul to imprison Raazer inside him. Judd found himself trapped at just under four feet in height, but with a greatly expanded life span. Much of Judd's subsequent activities in the years that followed remain unrevealed. It is known that Judd spent a year in Spain with another famous adventurer, the author Ernest Hemingway, where he learned to become a bullfighter, despite his size. In more modern years, he was working in some capacity at the Hull House orphanage in Canada. During this time, he helped other Canadian heroes help shut down an experimental energy reactor. (Many of these heroes would later be his teammates in Alpha Flight.) Once imprisoned for an unrevealed charge, he came to the attention of James MacDonald Hudson (Guardian), who was in the process of creating Canada’s first superhero team. He arranged for Judd’s parole so that he could join Beta Flight. At that time, Judd promised Hudson that he would never kill another human being again, perhaps a clue to his former imprisonment. Although Judd, code-named Puck, was officially to be promoted to join Alpha Flight, the Canadian government scrapped the project. Judd returned to working as a bouncer, but it wasn’t long before Guardian needed help against one of the Great Beasts, Tundra. Alpha Flight, including Judd, were reassembled. (Unfortunately, due to his limited resources, Judd failed to arrive in time to fight the Great Beast, although he made sure to track Hudson and burst onto the scene. He wouldn’t let Hudson consider abandoning the team again, not when he was finally promoted, and Alpha Flight was formed!)  Puck became one of the most committed members of Alpha Flight, serving them for a long tenure. Judd also found his infatuation for Heather Hudson, Guardian’s wife, growing. Guardian was believed to have died early in Alpha Flight’s organization, but Judd would never act on his feelings, considering himself too unworthy of her. The spirit of Raazer remained trapped within Judd for years, escaping only three times. Once, during Alpha Flight’s encounter with Deadly Ernest, Puck was forced to kill the villain, and the guilt, along with other pressures, such as his feelings for Heather Hudson and his wish to return to normal size, enabled Raazer to escape from Judd's body. Judd grew to his full height but also aged all the years he had lived. Alpha battled Raazer while Judd knew that he needed to imprison the sorcerer again. Using his \"light,\" Judd once again drew Raazer inside him, returning to his dwarfish size and youthful appearance. The second time, he was tricked by Arcade to believe he inadvertently contributed to the death of Heather Hudson. Again, the guilt unleashed Raazer, and Judd was the only one who could defeat him by drawing him back inside his body. The last time occurred when Alpha Flight journeyed to the site of a previous battle, the Ebony Firefountain, in an effort to cure the two Flight members, Aurora and Northstar, of mysterious ailments. During a fight with the Dark Elves, Puck was hurled into the Ebony Firefountain. The Asgardian trickster Loki, who was manipulating events from afar, arranged to have the Ebony Firefountain remove the demon Raazer from Puck's body. For reasons known only to himself, Loki negated the effects of time on Puck's body, so he retained his youth while growing to full size. But Judd's face looked as if he were approaching his real age of 74 years. Puck was separated from Alpha Flight at this point and the team assumed he was killed in the battle. Actually, Loki teleported Puck to the Himalayan Mountains, where he spent his time wandering and pondering his existence.Eventually, Puck decided to search for the Doorway Between Worlds, a mystical portal in the Himalayas that opened onto other worlds. Instead, the guru at the temple there showed him his old teammates in combat with the entity known as the Dreamqueen. While helping Alpha Flight fight the Dreamqueen, Puck sacrificed himself in order to hold the villain in her own dimension while Alphan associate Laura Dean closed the portal with her newly discovered power. Trapped in the Dreamqueen's dimension, Puck was tortured mercilessly by her. When she was done torturing him, she would renew his body to ready him for more torture.The Dreamqueen again fought Alpha Flight and at the end of the battle was banished to a distant limbo dimension. Puck escaped his prison and learned how to manipulate the dream dimension. Puck was able to escape the dimension when Alpha Flight was tricked into traveling there by Llan the Sorcerer. The Sorcerer had created an alternate Manhattan, completely populated by warped versions of superheroes, in order to trap Alpha Flight there while he continued his conquest of Earth. With Puck's help, Alpha Flight was able to escape the dimension and return to Earth to defeat Llan.The victory was not without a price, however. The injuries Puck accumulated in the dream dimension appeared once he returned to Earth. As they were cured with Dreamworld substance, the magic didn't stay beyond the dream dimension. While in the hospital, trying to recover from his injuries, Puck's height had mysteriously shrunk by two feet when he was captured by two minions of the Alpha's archenemy, the Master. Throughout his stay in the hospital, the Master's slaves had been injecting Puck with an enzyme derived from blood of another of Alpha Flight's enemies, the flesh-manipulator Scramble, and Puck's blood from a former stay at the hospital. The enzyme \"read\" Puck's previous blood as from a dwarf and was forcing Puck's body back into that shape.While being held prisoner at the Master's inter-dimensional complex, Puck was subjected to further treatments to make him into a mate for the late-Alphan Marrina. When Alpha Flight found him, he was a shifting mass of flesh, barely even resembling a human being. Judd's teammate, Sasquatch, used the Master's equipment to mold Judd's DNA back into its previous form, which also turned Puck back into a dwarf. Puck's tissues were condensed in this process of genetic manipulation, which caused his body to become denser. His body, now similar in strength and density to compressed rubber, allowed him to gain a boost in power, and he rejoined Alpha Flight.During a brief period when the team was disbanded, Puck continued as a solo adventurer, once teaming up with an old friend, Wolverine. Alpha Flight was reorganized under a new Department H, and Puck and others were recruited rather forcibly by armored agents called Epsilons. After fighting a new Zodiac organization, Puck agreed to remain a member, despite his misgivings about the Department’s questionable tactics, in part so that he could investigate what was going on, and perhaps also in part because Heather remained as well, and she and her husband had separated  recently. Puck eventually managed to reveal his feelings to Heather when there seemed no chance that she might reconcile with her husband, and she agreed to go out with him. Unfortunately, the date ended in disaster. When the Guardian leading the team was eventually revealed to be a clone, the true Guardian formed his own version of Alpha Flight to confront Department H. The two versions of Alpha Flight soon reconciled and joined together as one, and Puck remained a member despite Heather’s subsequent reunion with her husband.Puck was with Alpha Flight when they were captured by the alien Plodex and rescued by an all-new, all-different Alpha Flight, the latter of which included a new Puck, his reputed daughter. The Plodex complex was seeded with eggs that were using the genetic templates of the original Alphans for gestation, and Puck and the original Alpha Flight chose to accompany the eggs on the trip back to its home planet, leaving Earth, and his recently-discovered daughter, behind. Later, after a series of time-traveling misadventures, Alpha Flight was given Shaman’s magic pouch by their former enemy and time-manipulator, Flashback. Interestingly, this pouch was the same that Shaman had taken with him when he and the original Alphans left Earth on the Plodex ship. After opening the contents of the pouch, the original members of Alpha Flight were magically transported to the present from some time in the past. This included a past version of Puck, and the original team reclaimed the name Alpha Flight, setting themselves up as heroes in the present.",

      "biography": "Phillip Masters was a normal puppeteer until he found a clump of radioactive clay that he could use to fashion into puppets of people in order to control them. In his first display of power, he controlled a man to climb up a bridge in New York City and throw himself to his death. But the Human Torch flew by at the same time and spotted the man and flew in to save him. When Masters, then calling himself the Puppet Master, felt his hands burn as he touched the puppet he knew that the Torch had to be involved. Infuriated, he made a puppet of the Thing and used it to force him to come to his apartment. When he arrived, Masters’ stepdaughter, Alicia, sensed the presence of another person and unwittingly alerted her stepfather that the Invisible Girl had followed the Thing. Before Susan could do anything, Masters put gasmasks on himself, his stepdaughter, and the Thing, and flooded the room with ether to knock out the Invisible Girl. While she was asleep, Masters dressed up Alicia like her to fool the rest of the Fantastic Four and sent a controlled Thing and his blind stepdaughter to the Baxter Building.While the four were distracted, Masters used a puppet of the personal trustee of the warden of the state prison to break out the prison’s inmates and have them riot. But when his back was turned, the Invisible Girl tried to sneak out of his apartment but was tripped when he manipulated a puppet of her. She was able to fire her flare gun out of the window before being recaptured, however. The rest of the Fantastic Four soon appeared and Masters sent a massive, robot puppet after them, which the Thing quickly destroyed. He then tried to escape on a robotic, flying horse, along with the Invisible Girl in tow. But Mister Fantastic grabbed her at the last minute, and Masters escaped too fast for the Human Torch to follow.The Fantastic Four later stopped the riot and Alicia was left alone in their apartment, fearing that her stepfather would return to force her to help him with his evil plans. Masters did return, and revealed to Alicia a puppet of himself with a king’s crown and robe, then announced that he would control the leaders of the world to take over the planet and even bend the Fantastic Four into servitude. But Alicia fought him, and in the struggle she was knocked to the ground but managed to knock over his puppet, causing him to fall out of the window seemingly to his death. The Fantastic Four arrived shortly afterwards; baffled as to why he had fallen, but thankfully that he was out of the picture.But the Puppet Master was not dead, and continued to plot against the Fantastic Four and the rest of the world for years after. He later took control of Prince Namor, and tried to use his love for the Invisible Girl to destroy the Fantastic Four, but was beaten again. He frequently teamed up with the Mad Thinker, and on their first grouping he tried to use a puppet of Professor X to force the X-Men to beat the Fantastic Four, but the Beast eventually resisted control. He was also one of the villains that Doctor Doom used to attack Reed and Sue's wedding, but after trying to poison the Thing with a controlled guest, Nick Fury's men used a brain wave scanner to foil his plans. When his stepdaughter was captured by Skrulls a year later, and returned, Masters even tried to use his powers to reunite Alicia with her one-time boyfriend, the Thing, but to no avail.Recently, the Puppet Master again teamed up with the Mad Thinker to take advantage of the chaos caused by the Super Hero Registration conflict.",

He was captured, but released almost at once when the solider detaining him believed his flimsy excuse for being on the base.\n\nAfter realizing that he could manipulate people just by speaking to them, Killgrave used his victims to fulfill his desires. In one instance, he convinced a woman named Melanie to marry him. But, after he actually developed feelings for her, he removed his influence from her to see if she felt the same way. She did not and left him forever, eventually giving birth to a daughter she chose to keep secret, Kara. Kara was born with powers similar to her father?s and became the hero known as Persuasion.\n\nPower of the Mind\n\nKillgrave?s greatest power is his ability to sap people of their wills by uttering a mere verbal suggestion. His power originates in his skin cells, which have been altered at the genetic level, leaving him to appear purple-colored from head to toe. His natural pheromone production has been enhanced, creating a psychoactive effect which causes his victims to completely submit to his will.",

      "biography": "The early history of Quagmire is unknown. It is known that Quagmire began his career fighting Doctor Spectrum. Quagmire became part of the Institute of Evil that was formed by the Scarlet Centurion. The Quagmire and the rest of the Institute kidnapped the Golden Archer and used him to get information about the Squadron Supreme. Using the Archer's information Ape-X sent the Institute members to kidnap various family members of the Squadron with Quagmire himself kidnapping the children and wife of Whizzer. Successful in their individual missions the Institute then attacked the Squadron headquarters ambushing and behavior modifying Tom Thumb while the rest of the team were out on various missions. The Institute ambushed and behavior modified the Squadron members as they returned. Only the Whizzer was able to escape, but he too was eventually captured. After the Institute returned to their base the Squadron eventually revealed that they could not be behavior modified and were pretending in order to learn the location of the kidnap victims The Institute members were then quickly defeated.After their defeat, the Institute members were all behavior modified to be well-behaved citizens and follow the commands of all Squadron members and all of the Institute members were inducted into the Squadron Supreme. Quagmire helped with the construction of Squadron City and became a valuable asset to the team including going on a mission to recover asteroid remains with Tom Thumb. On an assignment to upgrade the safety of a factory with Ape-X and the Blue Eagle Quagmire was reprimanded by the Eagle for flirting with one of the female factory workers. Eagle punched Quagmire telling him he wasn't making a good impression because of his appearance and his attitude and then the Eagle flew off. After the Eagle left there was an accident at the factory and highly concentrated tranquilizer gas leaked out in lethal doses. Quagmire pulled thirty factory workers out of the facility by himself before falling into a coma due to his exposure to the gas. His comatose body was placed on life support under the care of Doctor Decibel at a hospital in Squadron City, and he was watched over by a guilt-ridden Blue Eagle. Eventually his comatose mind began subconsciously creating apertures into the Darkforce Dimension causing the hospital to fill with Darkforce material and drowning Doctor Decibel. Eventually the Squadron came to stop the flooding and Hyperion was forced to pull the plug connecting Quagmire's body to the machine's that were supposedly keeping him alive. The Darkforce material immediately disappeared as did Quagmire's body and he was believed to be dead.On Earth-616 Quasar was alerted to a disturbance at the Nexus of Realities and went to investigate. Quasar discovered Jennifer Kale and an apparently pregnant Man-Thing who were surrounded by a \"mud-storm\". What appeared to be pregnancy was in fact a dimensional aperture that had been absorbed into the belly of the Man-Thing and was beginning to open. Quasar used his Quantum Bands to cut open the Man-Thing and Quasar and Jennifer removed the body of Quagmire from the Man-Thing's open \"womb.\" Quagmire immediately awoke and acted in a manner consistent with the attitude he exhibited prior to his behavior modification, his coma and subsequent trans-dimensional journey apparently having reversed the process. Quagmire attacked Quasar and accosted Jennifer Kale when Quasar re-engaged him in battle and managed to knock Quagmire unconscious. The \"mud-storm\" (which was really just free floating Darkforce material that had been summoned by Quagmire) stopped instantaneously, and Quasar transported Quagmire to the Vault.Later, the Chief Examiner contacted Quagmire at the Vault and helped him escape. Quagmire then approached Kayla Ballantine and forced her through the Chief Examiner's black teleportal. Quagmire then battled a tiny antibody (one of the many that belonged to Antibody), which had snuck into the 616 reality from the New Universe. The tiny antibody then secretly sought refuge in Quagmire's body.After the Antibody broke free of Quagmire's body, Quagmire and other Darkforce users (including Cloak, the Shroud, Darkstar, and Silhouette) were controlled by the Darkling into attacking the New Warriors, the Avengers, and the Fantastic Four. Eventually the Darkling was defeated by a combined assault from Doctor Strange, Nova, and Dagger. All of the Darklings Darkforce puppets were released and it is presumed that Quagmire was sent to a superhuman holding facility.",

      "biography": "Some years ago, Elysius, the genetically engineered woman beloved by the late Captain Mar-Vell, conceived a son, Genis-Vell, from Mar-Vell’s D.N.A. and artificially accelerated him to young adulthood with implanted memories of growing up on Titan. After Elysius was slain by the Negative Zone denizen Lord Syphonn, Genis took the identity and heroic mission of Captain Marvel as his own, eventually helping the cosmic entities Entropy and Epiphany re-create the universe. In the process, a future action of Genis’s, the resurrection of Elysius, was realigned into contemporary reality so that, as far as recent history was concerned, Elysius had been resurrected shortly after she had died, or possibly had never died at all. In this altered reality, Elysius again underwent artificial pregnancy and bore a daughter, Phyla-Vell, whom she similarly aged to young adulthood with implanted memories. However, because Genis’s cosmic awareness had overwhelmed him during the reality crisis, his memories were only altered on a subconscious level, so on some level he still believed his mother had perished and he was an only child.Driven mad by his cosmic awareness, Genis rampaged across the universe. Elysius and her longtime friend Starfox pursued him to Titan, where Phyla, feeling Genis had disgraced the name of Captain Marvel, now claimed the title as her own. Upon arriving, Genis, already questioning his perceptions of reality, grew more confused as he fought a sister whom he remembered, yet felt had never existed. When Elysius and Starfox intervened, Genis opened a portal to Nth Space, a dimension which existed primarily in potentiality alone, and forced the three into it, but Phyla pulled him along. As Genis underwent a bizarre illusion scenario, Elysius and Starfox were able to overcome his insanity, and all four Titanians returned to Titan.Phyla remained convinced she should bear the name Captain Marvel, but an argument with Genis on the subject was interrupted by an attacking alternate future version of Marlo Jones, wife of Genis’s friend Rick. Genis investigated the timeline that had resulted in the attack, trusting Phyla to protect the contemporary Marlo, whom she rescued from an abduction attempt by the Magus, ally of the alternate Marlo and Ely-Vell, Genis’s son of that future era. Phyla then brought Marlo to Titan to better protect her, but her departure from Earth left Marlo’s female companion Moondragon open to attack by the Magus. When Genis returned from the future, Phyla was concerned by his obvious distress, unaware he had resolved to kill his own yet-to-be-conceived son to prevent the catastrophe Ely would cause later in life. Soon afterward, Moondragon lied to Marlo about the feelings between them and ended their romantic relationship, believing Marlo would be happier with Rick. Phyla was drawn to Moondragon by her selflessness, and a mutual romantic interest arose between the two, who departed together to investigate an unidentified portal, possibly proceeding afterward to view a spiral nebula near Renault VII. Recently, Moondragon was abducted by Thanos, and Phyla pursued him into the crisis known as the Annihilation Wave, already the center of conflict for many powerful space travelers. During the catastrophic battle with Annihilus and his insectoid forces, Phlya gained the powerful Quantum Bands from Wendell Vaughn (Quasar) the appointed protector of the universe.  Phyla sought the help of Moondragon’s father Drax the Destroyer, to rescue her from Thanos. Drax was eventually successful in rescuing Moondragon and taking the life of Thanos in the process. Reunited with her lover, Phyla went right back into cosmic chaos, Phyla and Moondragon found themselves on a dire mission to save the Kree race from immanent destruction, which was being caused by the techno-organic invaders known as the Phalanx. The two women warriors sought to find a powerful wizard that possessed the power to defeat the Phalanx. Before they could get off to a decent start on their quest, the woman adventurers were confronted by the Super-Adaptoid, who had been transformed into a Phalanx Select. Although the Adaptoid was viciously aggressive and cunning he was easily defeated. Phyla eventually found a cocoon that possessed the rejuvenating body of Adam Warlock, the phalanx were also in search of the Warlock and a battle ensued that eventually ended with Warlock being awakened prematurely and in a mentally unstable state. Phyla, Warlock and Moondragon managed to escape to a secret laboratory occupied by the High Evolutionary. There Phalanx attackers tracked them to the laboratory and Moondragon was slain by their leader Ultron. In a rage of passion Phyla lunged into battle, although she was persuaded by the High Evolutionary to retreat. Ultron and the Phalanx were eventually defeated and Phyla joined a new peace keeping teamed formed by Star-Lord. The team would later take on the name of the Guardians of the Galaxy and they utilized Knowhere as their base of operations.Although the team was led by Star-Lord, it was guided by the mystical insight of Adam Warlock, whose primary purpose seemed to be to prevent the collapse of fissure anomalies. On their first mission Phyla and the team clashed with followers of the mighty Universal Church of Truth, an intolerant and zealous religious empire.  Believing the Guardians to be anti-church heretics, the UTC has decreed Phyla and her teammates to be enemies of the faith. The team’s strategy is to keep whatever is on the other side of the fabric of reality out of their reality, which is the 616 universe.  To fulfill their goal Rocket Raccoon blew up the Temple Ship while Phyla and Adam absorbed the released energy and used it to drive the unknown predator back through the fissure.Discovering that Star-Lord had Mantis telepathically manipulate their minds to facilitate the formation of the Guardians most of the group quit. Phyla and Drax had already left in search of the young Earth girl Cammi, Drax’s former companion who has not been seen since the end of the first Annihilation catastrophe. While they questioned the inhabitants of an unidentified planet, a fortune teller revealed that there was a Great War of Kings about to take place and it might the reason for their being on this particular planet. Upset and annoyed with the woman’s distraction they began to walk away when she asked, was it the girl that they were looking for? The woman went to revealed that there was a chance for them to save Heather (Moondragon) from eternal death. Their search for her led them to the moon of Saturn also known as Titan. While on Titan they confronted Mentor, Moondragon’s step-father, who quickly murdered them both, so that their spirits could pass beyond the barrier of death into the realm of Oblivion, where Moondragon was trapped in the belly of the Dragon of the Moon. While in Oblivion's realm Phyla and Drax were approached by the malevolent trickster Maelstrom who was desperate to escape Oblivion. He took possession of the Phyla’s Quantum Bands, and used Phyla and Drax as sacrificial offerings to the Dragon of the Moon for passage out of Oblivion. Phyla was dropped into the mouth of the beast, but by unknown means was able to emerge from the monster transformed and possessing new powers. Wendell Vaughn had come to her rescue but was astound that she was free. He did manage to retrieve the Quantum Bands form Maelstrom, although Phyla refused to wear them again. She later revealed that she would be known as Martyr for now on. Recently, Phyla was captured by the Magus of the Universal Church of Truth, who in an attempt to resurrect their savior with a mysterious cosmically powered cocoon inadvertently raised the \"mad Titan\" Thanos from the dead.  Enraged, upset and disoriented Thanos seemingly took Phyla's life.",

He found that once he put the devices on he could control the energies the wristbands tapped into better then any of the other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents that had previously tried it. Nick Fury then recruited Wendell for S.H.I.E.L.D.‘s Super-Agent program.During a trip into space to learn the origins of the Quantum bands, Quasar was contacted by Eon, the guardian of Cosmic Awareness. He appointed Quasar the Protector of the Universe (inheriting the title from the now deceased Mar-Vell (Captain Marvel) and charged him with the task of preventing his murder. Quasar failed to save Eon, but stopped his killer, Maelstrom from collapsing the universe into a giant black hole.\nQuasar had long been an admirer of the Avengers and was honored when Captain America asked him to join the team. However he found that his duties as Protector of the Universe prevented him from giving the team his all. When the creature known as Ego attempted to swallow up the Earth into itself, Quasar absorbed Ego into his Quantum Bands. To guard against Ego being released, Quasar has been forced to exile himself into space. Quasar has encountered many super humans including Makkari, Deathurge, the Blue Shield, Firelord, Squadron Supreme, the Stranger, Jack of Hearts, Moondragon, and many others.While battling the Annihilation Wave alongside Nova, Quasar was killed by Annihilus.

      "biography": "During the Second World War, Ana Soria was the first female Marine in combat. Though she endured a lot of sexual discrimination, she persevered where most men failed. In the late stages of the war, the Americans feared they were not powerful enough to contain the Japanese or the Soviets. Using Captain America as a model, they continued with super-soldier experimentation on genetically likely subjects, none of whom were properly informed. Already a mutant, Ana was lined up with several officers on the island of Bikini Atoll, where they were blasted with the radiation of nuclear weapons in order to release latent powers. Most were killed, but Ana survived, warping into a human-insect hybrid. However, when the experiments did not produce obvious results, the program was shut down and Ana was thrown into a military asylum, her mind fractured. Worse, Captain America, with whom Ana had a close relationship, was believed killed at the end of the war, which only encouraged the U.S. government to abandon her. In the 1950s, however, Ana escaped and went into hiding.Recently, Ana surfaced in New York, still youthful and calling herself \"The Queen\". She demonstrated complete control over anyone possessing the so-called \"insect gene,\" an atavistic DNA feature which connected some humans to the point where they split from insects on the evolutionary tree; Spider-Man among them. While her human drones built her a nest in a New York highrise, Ana chose Spider-Man as her mate. She forced a fateful kiss on the web-slinger that unleashed an enzyme into his body. When he resisted, she began executing civilians, then used her powers to immobilize him.  Spider-Man was only saved when Captain America knocked Ana off the building. Surviving the fall, Ana moved her operations underground to a secret lab, where she had held the doctor responsible for her transformation since abducting him years before, and waited for the arrival of Spider-Man who was slowly mutating due to her kiss. Initially growing extra eyes, extra arms and fangs, Spider-Man was drawn to and defeated by the Queen before completely morphing into a giant spider. Ana expected the spider to give birth to her offspring but once the transformation was complete the spider died instead.  Distraught, Ana destroyed the lab and left without witnessing Peter Parker's rebirth from the spider's womb, with a few extra spider-like powers. Ana still held New York hostage, threatening to detonate a bomb that would exterminate all human life within 600 miles. Spider-Man disarmed the bomb and an unrelated explosion seemingly killed Ana.",

      "biography": "Pietro and his twin sister, Wanda, were raised by Django and Marya Maximoff, a gypsy couple. As adolescents Pietro and his sister Wanda discovered that they had peculiar talents. When Django began to steal food to feed his starving family, enraged villagers attacked the gypsy camp. Using his phenomenal speed, Pietro fled from the camp with his sister. Over the next few years, Wanda and Pietro wandered central Europe, living off the land. One day, Wanda accidentally caused a house to burst into flames with her uncontrollable hex powers and the pair was chased by superstitious townspeople. Despite Pietro's attempt to defend her, the twins were soon overpowered and were rescued by Magneto.\n\nUnwilling but believing they owed him a debt, the twins became members of Magneto's Brotherhood of Evil Mutants as Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch. For months they served in the Brotherhood, coming into conflict with the X-Men. When the extraterrestrial Stranger transported Magneto from Earth, the siblings left the Brotherhood. They learned the Avengers were seeking new members, and Quicksilver convinced his sister to leave for America and join the hero team. Alongside Captain America and Hawkeye, they remained with the Avengers for many years. They separated from the team only once, when Magneto manipulated Pietro and his sister into joining with him once again, but they soon realized the deception left. They then rejoined the Avengers during a conflict with the extra-dimensional Arkon.\n\nEventually, Wanda began to become romantically involved with the Vision, and Pietro condemned her relationship with a pseudo-human android, causing their first major rift. The rift was later mended, some time after Wanda married the Vision, when the telepath Moondragon permanently altered Pietro's prejudice toward the Vision in a self-righteous employment of her powers.\n\nPietro left the Avenges while the group was engaged in battle with the mutant-hunting Sentinel robots. Sustaining injuries in battle, Pietro was taken to medical care by Crystal, member of the Inhumans and whose dimension-spanning companion Lockjaw happened upon the scene of the battle. Months passed before Pietro was well enough to contact his companions to tell them of his circumstances. In the meantime, Pietro became romantically involved with his rescuer, and he and Crystal were married after a brief courtship. The wedding, held in the Inhuman city of Attilan, was attended by the Inhumans, the Avengers, and the Fantastic Four.\n\nThe Golden Age hero Whizzer knew of the exploits of Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch, believing them to be his children whom he abandoned when his wife, Miss America, died in childbirth on Wundagore Mountain. Feeling guilty, however, he made no effort to contact them, until the day he sought the Avengers help in saving his other son, Nuklo. Wanda had come to believe the Whizzer was her father, but Pietro remained dubious.\n\nMonths later, however, after being mystically abducted by Django Maximoff and freed by Avengers, Wanda and Pietro took a leave of absence from the team to investigate the secrets regarding their childhood origins. Returning to Wundagore Mountain, they met Bova and learned the truth of their parentage-- they were, in fact, the children of Magneto. His wife, the gypsy Magda, had fled from Magneto, terrified of the sudden manifestation of his power and intentions of world domination. Magda found her way to the tiny nation of Transia, finding refuge with Bova, a woman evolved from a cow by Wundagore’s High Evolutionary. Magda gave birth to twins, a boy and a girl, with Bova as her midwife, but was still afraid of her husband, and left Bova her children. Several nights later, a vacationing couple (the Whizzer and Miss America in their civilian identities) also needed refuge as the wife midwife assistance. Unfortunately, the couple's child was stillborn, and Miss America died in childbirth. Bova hoped to award Magda’s children to him instead, but the Whizzer fled from Wundagore upon hearing of his wife's death, nearly insane with grief. Bova instead presented the twins to the High Evolutionary, who found Django and Marya Maximoff, a gypsy couple camped nearby who had lost their own twin children, Ana and Mateo, during World War II. They cared for the children as their own.\n\nTheir abduction by Django also led to the revelation that Wanda held a connection to the demon Chthon, who was trapped within Wundagore Mountain and hoped to escape using Wanda as a host body someday. The return to the mountain allowed Chthon to possess Wanda, but she was soon freed by her brother, the Avengers, and Django Maximoff, who sealed Chthon inside Wundagore before dying.\n\nPietro and Crystal soon had their own child, a daughter, Luna. Not long after, Pietro was confronted by Magneto who wanted to investigate his grandchild's birth. Pietro denounced Magneto for his callous treatment of them when they were members of this Brotherhood and refused to believe he and amended his megalomaniacal ways. Eventually, however, when Magneto appeared to be reforming, Pietro relented in his resentment for his natural father.\n\nPietro had also volunteered his services to the head of the Inhumans’ small militia and became an officer. During his period of service, however, the Inhuman had no call for military activity. His neglect of his wife led her to become involved with another man. Learning of her infidelity, Pietro refused to forgive her and fled Attilan, vowing vengeance. He later tried unsuccessfully to frame the Avengers for treason, using the opportunity to attack the Avengers alongside the android Zodiac Cartel. He relented only after the Vision asked him if he was willing to orphan his and Wanda's infant children. Pietro later allied with the Hungarian government and assisted them in the development of techniques to create super-powered individuals. He proclaimed to believe fully in mutant supremacy and intended to rule the world as its self-proclaimed King of Mutants. He again tried to capture his Avengers teammates, but they escaped.\n\nDistraught and addled, Pietro was accosted by the original X-Factor team, who were posing as mutant-hunters at the time. X-Factor helped restore Pietro to the Inhumans, whereupon it was discovered that his criminal insanity had been artificially inflicted by Maximus the Mad, who had been influencing Pietro's actions since he split with Crystal. Maximus was defeated and Pietro remained with the Inhumans. He secretly renewed alliance with Avengers, however, and publicly pretended to rejoin Magneto in order to watch over and influence his sister, Wanda, who had at the time gone mad and rejoined Magneto's service. With Avengers, he helped free Wanda from exploitation by Magneto and Immortus, restoring her to sanity. Pietro then remained alongside the Avengers for another long tenure, remaining estranged from Crystal and the Inhumans.\n\nPietro later joined the U.S. government-sponsored X-Factor team, serving with the team throughout its public existence. At one point, during psychotherapy with Doc Samson, Pietro explained how his prickly personality stems largely from his frustration at dealing with a world where almost everyone and everything seems slow or stupid or both. When X-Factor was dropped from government sponsorship and forced to operate underground, Pietro left.\n\nWhen the Avengers were attacked by the alien Brethren, Pietro returned to aid the Avengers and found Crystal had also joined the team at the same time. Pietro refused to join the team since Crystal remained with them, although he later rejoined while participating in the rescue of his daughter Luna from Magneto's former Acolyte, Fabian Cortez, and his rival, Exodus. Pietro was gravely injured by Exodus and saved by the Avenger Black Knight, who by then was entertaining romantic intentions with Crystal. Recovering from his injuries at the Avengers Mansion, Pietro tried to win back Crystal. Ultimately, however, he began to repair his relationship with Crystal only after the Black Knight left Avengers.\n\nSoon afterward, Crystal and the other Avengers seemingly sacrificed themselves to stop the psychic menace of Onslaught. Pietro remained alongside the X-Men for a while before professing to wanting to track down other former Avengers. Instead, however, Pietro refused to join or to continue any form of the Avengers in retaliation from the government's anti-mutant legislation introduced in the wake of Onslaught.\n\nAgain confronting Exodus and Magneto's Acolytes, Pietro joined the High Evolutionary in repelling their attack on Wundagore. Pietro was asked to become the leader of a small band of the Evolutionary's Knights of Wundagore, animals that the geneticist had endowed with human intelligence and humanoid-like forms. Pietro accepted and exhibited an adeptness at leading the Knights in battles against injustice, although he soon left in order to find his true self.\n\nWhen the heroes who were believed dead returned to Earth, Pietro and Crystal were reunited. Both helped the Avenges reassemble and accepted the status of reserve members. Pietro would return to assist the Avengers on occasional missions.\n\nNot long afterward, Magneto was given control of the island nation of Genosha. Investigating his father's activities, Pietro was captured by resistance forces and would have been killed if not for the intervention of the X-Men Rogue and the former Acolyte Amelia Voght. After Magneto crushed the resistance, Pietro was ready to storm off when Voght teleported him to a Genoshan camp for those mutants infected with the Legacy Virus. Horrified, Pietro chose to stay in Genosha and act as his father's conscience, to remind him that both mutants and humans have to right not to be persecuted. He accepted a cabinet-level position in Magneto's new regime. This was all according to Magneto's plan, as he hoped to make Pietro into a loyal and subservient son. During his time with Magneto, Pietro was exposed to the mutagenic Isotope E, which boosted his powers to unforeseen levels. However, Pietro could no longer stomach his father's ruthless methods after witnessing him in battle against a Genoshan Resistance. He briefly warned the X-Men about Magneto and rejoined the Avengers.\n\nRecently, Wanda went mad, causing the deaths of Ant-Man, the Vision and Hawkeye, and though subdued, she remained a serious threat to the world. Quicksilver was shocked to find out that the Avengers and X-Men were deliberating over whether to kill his sister.\n\nEnraged, Quicksilver went to Genosha to find his sister, who had been taken into their father's care, and trying to make everything right, he convinced his sister to use her reality warping powers to make the House of M|\"House of M\", an alternate reality where mutants ruled. Magneto and his family were the rulers of this new world, and everything seemed to be going well until some renegade heroes informed the royal family of how the world had been before. Magneto's anger caused him to slay Quicksilver who was brought back to life quickly by a distraught Scarlet Witch. Magneto seemed to have calmed her down when Quicksilver's sister changed reality back to its previous state. However this time, blaming all her heartache on the powers she and her family possessed, the phrase she uttered to bring back reality removed millions of mutants' powers, Quicksilver included.\n\nUnable to cope with a world he felt was going too slow, Quicksilver went back to the Inhumans a wreck, and was convinced to use the Mists of Terrigen to gain powers once more. He succeeded in gaining new and fantastic powers, which included being able to move his molecules so fast that he could travel in time, which has had severe effects on the way he is aging, and took his daughter Luna with him to Earth, via Lockjaw. There he took the stolen Mists and used them on Unus, Freakshow, Shola, Wicked, Callisto, and other de-powered mutants still living in Genosha. Soon he gave the de-powered mutants their powers back and encountered the Office of National Emergency and was teleported away once again by Lockjaw. However Pietro was not satisfied and continued to use the Mists which caused shards of the Mist to become imbedded in his hands which he used to give the Reaper his powers back. His next move is unknown.",

      "biography": "Dr. Chen Lu was his country's foremost researcher in nuclear radiation and its effect on humans. When the select members of the Chinese military sought out ways to create a costumed champion with enough power to defeat Thor, they turned to Chen Lu. They sought revenge for Thor's success in stopping an invasion of India, but Chen hoped that he could use the opportunity to give himself power enough to take over the world. Chen turned his experiments upon himself, creating the powerful Radioactive Man. He immediately traveled to New York City and challenged Thor. Chen wasted no time proving to Thor that Mjolnir (Thor's hammer) or his elemental forces had no effect against him. With but a thought he could deflect Thor's hammer like it was a gnat.  He convinced Thor that any \"sudden physical violence\" would cause him to \"blow up like an H-Bomb\". With no immediate solution at hand, Thor fell victim to Chen's Hypnotic-Trance becoming his slave. Chen ordered Thor to throw his hammer away so that he could possess it, but failed to order him how far. Thor tossed it out of Chens line of sight to the bottom of the Hudson River causing him to chase after it.  Chen had no way of knowing that Thor could not be separated from his hammer for more than sixty seconds without changing back to Don Blake. Unable to find Mjolnir, and believing Thor had escaped, Chen took off looking for him. Chen was hunted down by Thor once more on the roof of a building while he was about to blow up New York City.  He was trapped inside a private tornado created by Thor and transported to China. Thor allowed The Radioactive Man to impact the ground upon arrival causing an atomic explosion.  Chen, mistakenly, was believed to have perished from the explosion.Chen Lu was contacted by Baron Heinrich Zemo to help form the original Masters of Evil as a counterpart for the Avengers' Thor. However, Zemo's plan to defeat the Avengers and hold New York in thrall failed because the Avengers switched up opponents and the Radioactive Man was beaten by Iron Man (Tony Stark). Another version of the Masters of Evil, this time led by Ultron, again failed to defeat the Avengers.Retreating to Vietnam, the Radioactive Man joined the Crimson Dynamo and the Titanium Man in the Titanic Three, champions of eastern Communism and self-styled heroes of the area. The Avengers visited the country on an adventure with Mantis and the original Swordsman, but a common criminal known as the Slasher thought they were after him. He tricked the Titanic Three into battling the Avengers, but in his escape, the Slasher spilled his stolen goods, and the Titanic Three abandoned him. At some point, the threesome went their separate ways once the Crimson Dynamo left to fight Iron Man.Returning to New York but laying low, Chen Lu was recruited by Egghead to re-form the Masters of Evil. The Masters successfully liberated Hank Pym (then Yellowjacket) from his criminal trial, convincing the public he had become a criminal. It was all part of Egghead's plan to disgrace and humiliate Pym, but Pym turned the tables of the Masters of Evil, defeating them all in time for his rescue by the Avengers.Deported to China, the Radioactive Man worked as an agent of the Mandarin briefly, coming into conflict with Iron Man (James Rhodes) when he intercepted a shipment of sensitive equipment meant for the Mandarin.While remanded to custody at the Vault, the prison was shut down due to a breakout, trapping the heroes and villains alike. Iron Man convinced the Radioactive Man to help him shut down a reactor that threatened to explode by using his powers to absorb the excess radiation, after which the breakout was shortly foiled.He later appeared as an agent of Tiberius Stone, who posed as a hostage of the Radioactive Man so that he would battle Iron Man (Tony Stark). After a desperate battle, Iron Man thwarted the villain, although he couldn’t prove Stone was behind the plan to discredit Stark International.After a period of introspection, Chen Lu came to realize that the energy fluctuations that came with his powers was often tied to emotional imbalances. He explained this as factoring into his past decisions to work on behalf of others, when really he felt superior to petty bureaucrats and megalomaniacs and would have preferred to work towards his own interests. As such, he returned to the People’s Republic of China, offering to work as the people’s champion in penitence of past deeds, which he called “the Count,” the number of every person who died or suffered, directly or indirectly, from the use of his powers.About this time, China was attacked by militant Atlanteans calling themselves Fathom's Five. Traveling to the United Nations, the Radioactive Man was asked to aid the Thunderbolts in defeating Fathom's Five, after which he elected to remain with the team. Unknown to his teammates, the Radioactive Man had used his powers to \"infect\" Fathom's Five member Llyron so that he would release low levels of radiation when he returned to stand trial in Atlantis. The Sub-Mariner discovered the treachery, confronting Chen Lu and the Thunderbolts. Chen refused to apologize for his attempt at revenge on the Altantean people, but upon considering the Count, he reabsorbed the radiation which was killing Atlantis. Instead, he secretly infected the militant mole Tamara Rahn so that she would carry a time-released \"virus\" back to the militant stronghold and only those responsible would be affected.When the Thunderbolts learned Baron Zemo had formed a team to kill their member Photon, they battled Zemo's team until they were forced to agree with his belief that Photon's continued existence would threaten to destroy reality. The Radioactive Man was among those asked to continue when the two teams merged into one, and he agreed, but remained skeptical, however, about the moral leadership of Zemo and Songbird. Recently, Radioactive Man was called to China again and left the Thunderbolts team.",

      "biography": "Ivan Kragoff was the Soviet’s premier space pioneer who vowed to be the first human being to land on the moon. Using a fuel made of the same meteoric materials that Reed Richards used to create his, Ivan launched a spaceship at the precise time that the Fantastic Four launched their own into space. Ivan crewed his ship with a trio of apes that he had trained to operate the ship, repair its machinery, and fire weapons, which he kept under-fed so that they would continue to obey him. And because Ivan had spent time researching the Fantastic Four, he was prepared for the cosmic rays he would encounter along the way, though unlike the four heroes, Ivan constructed his spaceship out of transparent, ceramic plastic to allow as much of the cosmic rays to filter through as possible. So that once he had reached space, Ivan and his three apes were bombarded by an intense dose of the rays, more than the Fantastic Four before them. Ivan’s Gorilla became super-strong; his orangutan gained control of magnetism; and the baboon gained the ability to transform into other objects at will. Ivan Kragoff, himself, became the Red Ghost, with the power to make his body insubstantial, allowing him to pass through solid objects.Once the Red Ghost and his Super Apes reached the Blue Area of the Moon, they found an abandoned city as well as a more modern, inhabited dwelling. They also found the Fantastic Four’s Thing, and fought with him until Uatu The Watcher appeared and stopped the apes and the two combatants. He explained that his species observed others, but never interfered. However, Earth was becoming dangerously close to a devastating clash between the United States and Russia, which might reduce the human race to savagery and barbarism. He also announced that the Red Ghost and the Fantastic Four must fight to decide the battle.  The Red Ghost and his Apes fought the Fantastic Four until Reed designed a paralyzing ray that enabled him to freeze the Red Ghost who could not otherwise be touched. Then, while the Watcher explained that he would have to move his base to a new place, now that humans were capable of traveling to the moon, the Red Ghost’s gorilla released him from his paralysis. But when the Red Ghost tried to control them, after the Invisible Girl had fed them, they turned on him and chased him across the moon.He returned many times after, using his apes to fight the Fantastic Four. At one time he tried to strand the Fantastic Four on the Moon, but they escaped to the Blue Area and soon fought back, knocking the Red Ghost into a portal and returning home. The Red Ghost was also one of the villains that Doctor Doom used to disrupt Reed and Sue's wedding. He attacked Susan and Alicia Masters, but Doctor Strange appeared and used his powers to send him to a distant nether world.",

      "biography": "As a young man, Thaddeus Ross enlisted in the military and received his nickname from his troops because he \"struck like a thunderbolt\" when leading them into action. Now he has become the very thing he hated most in life. He is the Red Hulk. Military Man General Thaddeus E. Ross was born into a family with a proud tradition of military service. Both his father and his grandfather served heroically in past American wars. As a boy Thaddeus immersed himself in military history, and he learned how to fly by barnstorming at country fairs.When he came of age Ross enlisted in the military, graduating first in his class at West Point. He married Karen Lee, the daughter of his commanding officer at the time. Ross rapidly rose in rank to captain and then major while serving in his first war. Ross made a great reputation as a leader in combat, but after the war, he was stationed at the nuclear research facility at Los Alamos, New Mexico. There he met nuclear physicist Brian Banner, the father of Robert Bruce Banner.Ross had risen to the rank of colonel by the time he was sent to his next war, during which he became a general in the U.S. Air Force (Ross never rose beyond three-star general). As he gloried in combat, he was dissatisfied with the \"desk jobs\" he was given before and after the war.Ross's wife, Karen, bore him only one child, his daughter Betty. Karen died when Betty was in her early teens. General Ross came to command Desert Base, New Mexico - a missile base and nuclear research site. He resented the fact that Bruce Banner, a civilian, was appointed supervisor of the gamma bomb project. Moreover, the general had contempt for the scrawny, intellectual Banner for failing to live up to Ross's own vision of true manhood. Making matters worse was the growing attraction between Banner and Betty, whom Ross hoped would marry a military officer. A New War to Fight Banner was transformed into the Hulk as a result of intense radiation exposure during the first test of the gamma bomb. The savage Hulk quickly became a menace, and Ross began his long career of hunting the Hulk. Banner's frequent, unexplained absences made Ross suspect Banner of treasonous activity and of a possible alliance with the Hulk himself. To prove his suspicions, Ross brought Major Glenn Talbot to Desert Base as the new security chief. The Pentagon designated Ross as head of Operation: Hulk.Even after Banner's dual identity became public knowledge, Ross continued his pursuit of the Hulk, causing Banner to become a fugitive. Ross incorrectly suspected that Banner controlled the Hulk and was thus a menace to national security. Over the years, Ross succeeded in capturing the Hulk or Banner, but the Hulk usually thwarted the general's attempts to permanently put him down. Embittered by these failures, Ross became obsessed with the Hulk.Ross frequently found himself in conflict with other superhuman foes too, most notably the Leader and the Abomination. Invariably these threats were defeated by Banner or the Hulk, forcing the general to regard the Hulk with a grudging respect. When Banner actually did gain control of the Hulk, Ross reluctantly approved of his marriage to Betty. However, the Leader sabotaged the process, transforming Banner back into the savage Hulk before they could be wed. Ross himself was injured in the ensuing conflict. Calling All Hulkbusters The U.S. Government commissioned Operation: Greenskin, based out of Hulkbuster Base, a special site for operations to capture or kill the Hulk. Due to his experience, Ross was given command of the base and its troops, commonly referred to as the Hulkbusters. The primary directive of the Operation was to capture the Hulk and cure him, as well as study the effects of radiation on the human body to bring about major medical breakthroughs.Ross led a team of Hulkbusters to pursue the Hulk into the Arctic Circle where he was captured by the Gremlin, a Russian agent. Ross was freed by the combined efforts of Glenn Talbot and Air Force colonel Jack Armbruster. However, in the process, Talbot was captured in his place and presumed by the others to be dead. As a result of his capture, Ross was relieved of command of Operation: Greenskin and replaced by Armbruster. Though officially on leave, Ross often accompanied Armbruster on Hulkbusters missions. After Armbruster was killed, Ross and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Clay Quartermain led a team to rescue Talbot.Ross rededicated his command post as Gamma Base, focusing even more on gamma research. However, injured when the Leader took over Gamma Base, Ross was pushed into a nervous breakdown by Moonstone, who used her psychiatric skills to crumble his psyche. Ross spent a length of time under the care of Doc Samson. During this time Betty and Glenn Talbot had gotten married and divorced, the funding for Gamma Base was cancelled, and Talbot died while trying to kill the Hulk. Bad Decisions Ross eventually recovered and returned to active duty, hell-bent on avenging Talbot's death. He also blamed the Hulk for his nervous breakdown. Ross was unable to regain funding for hunting the Hulk, but the President made him a special advisor at the Pentagon on matters relating to the dangers posed by the Hulk. However, soon after, Banner regained control of his alter-ego, and the President pardoned him for all of his past offenses.Ross made an alliance with both the Abomination and MODOK to eliminate his archenemy. This effort, too, failed; when Betty Ross learned of these events, she was appalled, accusing her father of treason. Overwhelmed by shame, Ross nearly committed suicide in his office in the Pentagon. However, he instead dropped out of sight, during which time he was dishonorably discharged. Ross became a drifter, sinking increasingly further into insanity.Upon learning that Betty and the seemingly cured Bruce planned to marry, Ross attempted to stop the wedding at gunpoint. Ross shot Rick Jones when he tried to stop him, but Betty confronted her father and persuaded him to let the wedding proceed. Ross was hospitalized and placed under psychiatric care.Ross's old ally Clay Quartermain enabled Ross to participate in an experiment that would give him the powers of Zzzax. However, the experiment went awry and Zzzax absorbed Ross's consciousness, after which the Ross-controlled creature attacked Bruce Banner and Rick Jones, who had taken a Hulk-like form at the time. Ross/Zzzax fled after being forced to recognize that he himself was now a monster, and Ross's mind returned to his own body. Still retaining some electrical powers, Ross sacrificed his life, using that energy to destroy the mutant Nevermind which had briefly terrorized Gamma Base. No Peace in the Afterlife Ross's body was taken by the Leader, who had the Soul Man restore it to a semblance of life as a nearly mindless servant, and placed it in the Redeemer armor after its previous occupant's death. After being exposed as the new Redeemer, Ross was nearly killed again during a battle with the Hulk, who believed him to another of the Leader's tricks. He was recovered by the Troyjans, who fanned the spark of life within him and brought him to the Leader's Freehold Base where he eventually regained his memories and personality. Not long after this, Ross was restored to his previous position of Air Force General. The Loss of a Child Leads to Conflicting Emotions Ross blamed Bruce for Betty's apparent death from radiation poisoning and went on to lead a new incarnation of the Hulkbusters. However, while pursuing the Hulk he confronted the Abomination and learned that it was actually he who had poisoned Betty. Afterwards, Ross made his peace with Banner.Later, Ross was coerced into working with General John Ryker against the Hulk, but ultimately Ross helped the Hulk free himself and defeat Ryker's plot. Soon after, Ross goaded the Hulk into seeking out and badly beating the Abomination. After using his former enemy to gain the vengeance that he himself lacked the power to accomplish, Ross allowed Banner to leave in peace. Murder, Mayhem and Betrayal  The assassination of the Abomination in his homeland of Russia led to an investigation conducted by Iron Man, Commander Maria Hill, of S.H.I.E.L.D., General Ross, Doc Samson and the She-Hulk. One conclusion was of the majority; the person responsible was the Hulk. There were only two problems with this theory. The first was the Abomination was ultimately killed by gunfire – from a missing gun – and the second was Bruce Banner was locked away at Gamma Base in Nevada. However, the massive amounts of residual radiation at the scene seemed to give credence to the hypothesis even though there was speculation as to why the massive footprint, supposedly belonging to the Hulk, had turned the sand underneath it into glass. Upon returning to Gamma Base, General Ross and Samson turned to the one man that could help them in their search for their gamma-powered mystery: Bruce Banner. It wouldn’t be long before the assassin revealed himself.A Red Hulk was on the loose, and there seemed to be no way to stop him. He defeated every challenger in his path – both gods and monsters. Still, it was his confidence that ultimately led to his defeat. Despite besting both Hulk and Thor in their initial meetings, both opponents came back for round two. Again, Hulk found himself on the losing end until Thor returned ready to teach the monster a lesson. Thor fought the Red Hulk to a stand-still, and just as he was about to deliver the final blow, Hulk snatched victory from Thor's grasp. Hulk needed to win this battle, and A-Bomb convinced Thor of this as well. Hulk uncovered Red Hulk's condition of the angrier he gets, the hotter he gets, and guessed it could be a weakness. Hulk let his opponent strike him repeatedly until the heat became too intense for the Red Hulk. He became unbalanced, and Hulk was able to finish him off quickly. Satisfied, the Hulk left as A-Bomb transformed back to Rick, and before Rick could yell out the true identity of the red beast, he was shot in the back by Doc Samson. Samson dragged Rick away as General Ross berated the defeated Red Hulk; telling him how he was given the means to destroy the Hulk and he blew it.  Hell Hath No Fury… She-Hulk, still angry over the beating the Red Hulk gave her, called in a few friends to help dish out some payback. Two powerhouses in Valkyrie and Thundra answered her call. The mission was to find and take down the Red Hulk in hopes of determining who he really is. The trio found him on Mount Rushmore, but even with their combined strength, the Red Hulk proved to be more than a match for them. The three female gladiators almost succeeded in their task, but the Red Hulk simply would not give in. Once reinforcements showed up in the form of Invisible Woman, Black Widow, Tigra, Spider-Woman, Storm and Hellcat, the odds suddenly turned against the massive red devil. The Red Hulk would not be stopped as he tossed around the Lady Liberators like rag dolls, but it wasn't until She-Hulk built up a rage so fierce that her next assault staggered the monster. The rest of the women followed suit, and it seemed as if victory was theirs. The Red Hulk was down and bound in chains as they waited for him to revert back to his civilian identity, and only Thundra wanted to slay the beast. Red Hulk was merely playing possum with the Liberators, and he broke free of his chains, kidnapped Thundra and offered to recruit her because of her warrior nature. The proposition remained undisclosed to Thundra's allies, and the Red Hulk went on his way - his identity still a mystery.  Offenders / Defenders War Soon after, one of the Elders of the Universe, the Collector, came to the Red Hulk with a proposition. Red Hulk could handpick teammates from any point in the time stream to assist him in battle against an opposing team put together by another Elder, the Grandmaster, in a cosmic game of life or death. Red Hulk readily agreed and chose Tiger Shark, Baron Mordo and Terrax, dubbing them the Offenders. The fiendish foursome discovered their foes would be their heroic counterparts of the original Defenders, and they were all too eager to destroy them. Once paired off, Grandmaster and the Collector felt the combatants were too evenly matched, so they decided to add a new element to the game. Before the new addition could be added to the Hulks' underwater arena, Red Hulk killed Hulk by impaling him on the end of a trident, ending his participation. The Red Hulk's win went to his head, and he presumed he could give orders to the two Elders responsible for the game. At his behest, Red Hulk was inserted back into the game where he proceeded to murder each of his teammates, starting with Terrax. After he absorbed the Power Cosmic of the Silver Surfer, Red Hulk exterminated the remaining Defenders, Dormammu and challenged Galactus too. Galactus would have nothing to do with Red Hulk's insolence and took the cosmic energy inside him away, expelling him back to the Elders with a warning. The Grandmaster had enough of the Red Hulk and resurrected the Defenders to deal with him. He also undid the damage to the other Offenders, but he was too late to save himself. Red Hulk viciously attacked him until the Hulk intervened and punched him through a mountain face. The Collector claimed the Grandmaster was dead, and he refused to honor the deal to restore the soul mates of the Defenders. Each individual was returned to their respective time and Hulk was left distraught over his still dead love, Jarella. Red Hulk was happy his nemesis was alive because the Hulk was left in the same state he was left in at one time – with a broken heart. Hulk No More She-Hulk enlisted the help of Ben Urich to discern the true identity of the Red Hulk. Urich brought along a photographer and She-Hulk brought Doc Samson to infiltrate an A.I.M. base - posing as a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility - to expose the truth behind the mystery. Samson revealed to all how A.I.M's leader, M.O.D.O.K., was experimenting on gamma-powered individuals, with the help of General Ross, to make gamma-powered super soldiers. The satellite used to bring Hulk down during World War Hulk was under M.O.D.O.K.'s influence, and he interfaced with Banner's irradiated cells. Using this information, M.O.D.O.K. was responsible for the creation of the Red Hulk, Rick Jones' transformation into A-Bomb, and the evil split personality of Doc Samson which gave away the group's position. A fight broke out between Samson and She-Hulk, leaving Urich to fend for himself against the Red Hulk. Luckily for him, the photographer who accompanied Urich doubles as the amazing Spider-Man, and Spider-Man tangled with the red giant until a captive Banner changed into the Hulk. The two Hulks clashed, but Red Hulk used his radiation absorption abilities to steal the gamma energy from inside the Hulk, preventing him from ever becoming the monster again. The A.I.M. base was destroyed, but Red Hulk wasn't about to let Urich reveal anything he saw that day. He threatened the reporter if one word saw print, he would kill everyone at Urich's newspaper - Front Line - in one murderous rampage. Code Red Following the orders of his superiors, Red Hulk went to a predesignated location and was spied upon by Domino. Fearing she uncovered his secret identity, Red Hulk gave chase but lost her when a roof collapsed under his feet. He was given names of other operatives by Samson and Ross and forced to form a team in order to secure Domino, making sure she would tell no one what she saw. His team, secretly named Code Red, found their target, but Domino was not without friends of her own. X-Force was on hand, and they weren't about to hand Domino over. A furious battle between both teams, and a surprise appearance of a Red She-Hulk, ended in betrayal by Samson – severing Red Hulk's affiliation with his employers, the Intelligencia. Red Hulk discovered his true identity was exposed just to show him he wasn't as untouchable as he believed. The specific members of his team were chosen because they would ensure his identity would be spread around if Domino had talked. Red Hulk had a new war to fight, but only he knew what his next move would be. End Game Red Hulk set up a meeting with General Ross that concluded with the general's death when he showed up in the Redeemer armor, intending to kill the red giant. After the memorial service, Red Hulk met with his new ally who appeared to have orchestrated Ross's death all along, Bruce Banner. When the Frightful Four attacked the Fantastic Four in the Baxter Building, Red Hulk uncharacteristically came to their rescue. He managed to save everyone inside from being sucked into a portal even though Mister Fantastic was kidnapped. He also tried to prevent the Intelligencia from abducting Beast and Black Panther (T'Challa) from his home in Wakanda but opposing the X-Men as well as the Red Ghost proved to be too much for him. Red Hulk's last chance to stop the Intelligencia would be aboard their Hellcarrier. His presence was expected, and they unleashed the Gammadroid and Cosmic Hulk to take him down. Instead of preventing his former allies from unleashing their master stroke, Red Hulk became a part of it as they siphoned off much of his energy to create an army of Hulks. His backup plan, Deadpool, saved him before they completely drained him, but he was saturated in a gamma bath, transforming him into Hulkpool. Other heroes on the scene were also affected by the gamma radiation. The worst part for Red Hulk was the Intelligencia had won with a plan he devised. Mysteries Revealed General Ross never told anyone that from the first moment he encountered the Hulk he coveted the creature's raw power. After suffering several defeats at the brute's hands, Ross finally got a taste of what real power felt like when the Leader placed him in the Redeemer armor. Finally, he had enough power to destroy the monster that plagued him for years, but there was one drawback. Ross couldn't speak or function on his own and appeared to be in a catatonic state though he was fully conscious of what was happening to him; even the Leader wasn't aware Ross's mind was undamaged. Ross was eventually returned to his normal state, but his obsession with the Hulk continued to grow.At a time when Ross was at his lowest point – Hulk was banished off-world, Betty was dead and Captain America was killed – the Leader and M.O.D.O.K. came to him once more. They had a plan that needed Ross to succeed, and they made him an offer he couldn't refuse. The Leader promised to resurrect Betty if Ross agreed to work with them. After Hulk returned to Earth and waged war on the Illuminati, that's when Ross's obsession gave way to his new nightmare. Using radiation siphoned from the Hulk, Leader and M.O.D.O.K. transformed Ross into the Red Hulk. However, Ross didn't reveal his true identity until he came under attack by the Red She-Hulk for a second time. He offered no resistance to her violence, telling her he could never harm his daughter.  Banner discerned Red Hulk's true identity beforehand and knew the Ross appearing in public was merely a Life Model Decoy operated by M.O.D.O.K.. That's why he took control of its programming, stole the Redeemer armor and had Red Hulk smash it. Banner figured he could end the Intelligencia's plan if the key to it succeeding was destroyed. Red Hulk didn't tell Banner he stood idly by while Samson killed Clay Quartermain after he brought down the Helicarrier. Ross Takes Command Drained both mentally and physically because of his ordeal aboard the Hellcarrier, Ross looked defeated until an out-of-control Cosmic Hulk happened upon him and attacked. Ross absorbed much of the radiation flowing through the robot's body, triggering his transformation back to the Red Hulk. He tore the Cosmic Hulk in half and began his search for the Leader. Done with alliances and ready to take on the world solo, Red Hulk confronted the Leader only to learn Glenn Talbot was inserted into the White House as a replacement for Ross since the world believed him dead. Red Hulk absorbed all the gamma radiation within the Leader's body, leaving him an ordinary man. He then proceeded to the White House to destroy what he assumed was another Life Model Decoy of Talbot controlled by the Leader while it was addressing the people of the nation. Red Hulk held the LMD's severed head up to the cameras and stated he was now in charge. Red Hulk was not going to place the country he fought so hard to protect over the years in jeopardy, but to his surprise, the Hulk returned and challenged his authority. The battle of the Hulks was savage, and both knew the only way their feud would end was when one of them was dead. Banner was unwilling to take a life, but his opponent wasn't as squeamish. Red Hulk delivered a killing blow only he failed to kill the Hulk. Instead, he was defeated, and Hulk told him he could never change back into Ross or he would expose him as a traitor to the world. Ross was trapped in the body of what he hated most and there was nothing he could do about it. Red Hulk was imprisoned, and Hulk called in Steve Rogers to give his enemy a chance at redemption. Scorched Earth Ross' time to prove himself would come as a backup plan of the Leader's and M.O.D.O.K.'s automatically initiated after their defeat. Steve Rogers enlisted Red Hulk to stop everything from techno-viruses to speeding comets, hard-sound sea monsters to mega-life from Monster Island, but Red Hulk could not handle it alone. Specially selected teammates were paired with Red Hulk, but all had a score to settle with him. Iron Man, Thor, Namor and even A-Bomb had all fallen to his might, but each of them had to move past previous defeats to save Earth from certain destruction. Red Hulk ran into trouble on Monster Island while attempting to stop the inhabitants from marching to the mainland and destroying everything in their path. His body overheated as his temper rose, and Red Hulk transformed back to Ross. He would have been eaten if Banner had not teleported to his side, giving Ross enough time to cool down and change back. Again at full strength, the Hulks found the supercomputer consisting of several cloned M.O.D.O.K. brains responsible for activating the Scorched Earth scenarios, and Red Hulk demolished it, shutting it down. Unknown to him he missed one of the brains which was implanted into a new body and MODOK Superior was born.   Lights! Camera! Fight!  With the doomsday plot averted, Red Hulk was assigned other tasks to give him purpose. While on the tail of a spiraling portal Red Hulk was attacked by a mind-controlled Woodgod but quickly defeated him. Woodgod retreated back through the portal, and his master returned in his place. The original Hulk, the mighty Xemnu, came for a rematch with the Hulk to lay claim to the planet Earth, and the Impossible Man was with him to record the event for a galactic fighting circuit. Xemnu was not interested in battling an imposter, but Red Hulk was not interested in Xemnu's opinion of him either. However, Red Hulk was susceptible to Xemnu’s mind control and was forced to pummel himself with his own fists until Banner showed up, and the Impossible Man merged both green and red Hulks, combining their best aspects into one individual. Xemnu had prepared for any eventuality and unleashed his own creation engineered with the Hulk's DNA – Kluh. At first it was difficult for their two minds to act as one, but there was one thing Ross and Banner could focus on to help them solve their problem, Betty. Now able to focus clearly this composite Hulk was able to defeat Kluh and Xemnu,  again saving the Earth from certain disaster. The Impossible Man proposed they go on tour with the galactic fighting circuit but immediately separated the two Hulks who hated the idea.",

      "biography": "Johann Shmidt was born the son of an abusive, drunken German villager named Hermann Shmidt and his saintly, long suffering wife Martha, who for years endured abuse and beatings from her husband. Martha died giving birth to Johann, their only child. Driven to madness by the death of the woman he both loved and hated, Hermann Shmidt tried to drown the newborn infant, accusing him of murdering Martha. The doctor who had just delivered the baby saved Johann from his father, and the next morning Hermann Shmidt committed suicide. The doctor took Johann to an orphanage, where the child led a lonely existence. Johann ran away from the orphanage when he was seven years old and lived in the streets as a beggar and a thief. As he grew older he worked at various menial jobs but spent most of his time in prison for crimes ranging from vagrancy to theft.\n\nIn his late teens during the rise of the Third Reich, Shmidt got his most prosperous job, a bellhop in a major hotel. There he served the rooms of Adolf Hitler himself. By chance, he was present when Hitler was furiously berating an officer and swore he could train Johann himself, a simple bellhop, to be a better National Socialist. Looking closely at him and sensing his dark inner nature, Hitler decided to take up the challenge and recruited Shmidt.\n\nDissatisfied with the standard drill instruction his subordinates used to train Shmidt, Hitler took over personally. Upon completion, Hitler gave Shmidt a unique uniform with a grotesque red skull mask, and he emerged as the Red Skull. His role was the embodiment of Nazi intimidation, while Hitler could remain the popular leader of Germany. The Red Skull was appointed head of Nazi terrorist activities with an additional large role in external espionage and sabotage. He was spectacularly successful, wreaking havoc throughout Europe in the early stages of World War II. The propaganda effect was so great that the United States government decided to counter it by creating their own equivalent using the recipient of the lost Operation Rebirth, Steve Rogers, Captain America.\n\nThe two counterparts soon clashed in what would be a series of engagements throughout the war, ending with a final battle that left the Skull buried under the rubble of a bombed building. Because he was immediately exposed to an experimental gas there, he remained in suspended animation for decades.\n\nJohann was eventually rescued in modern times by the terrorist organization, HYDRA. The Skull quickly subverted a HYDRA cell to his own ambitions of world conquest and the death of Captain America.\n\nThe Skull and Captain America resumed their personal war against each other. The Skull was consistently frustrated by failure; not even when the Skull possessed the reality-altering Cosmic Cube could he claim victory. At one point, the Skull's health failing, he had Nazi geneticist Arnim Zola make him into an imitation of the Captain's civilian identity, Steve Rogers, using cloned tissue from Captain America's body. Under the alias of Mr. Smith, the Red Skull had Douglas Rockwell, the head of the U.S. president's Commission on Superhuman Activities, make unreasonable demands upon Captain America, while arranging for the Taskmaster to train a replacement for Captain America, appointed the violent and mentally unstable John Walker. When the CSA's requests forced Rogers to relinquish the Captain America identity, the CSA assigned John Walker to fill the role. As the new Captain America, Walker was manipulated by the Skull to act in a manner which publicly disgraced the image of the hero. The Skull then tried unsuccessfully to use Walker to kill Rogers (now \"the Captain.\") When Rogers defeated Walker, the Skull tried to blow the Dust of Death on Rogers. Walker hit the Skull him from behind with his shield, exposing Shmidt to the dust. He suffered the signature facial disfigurement attributed to the Dust, yet survived due to years of exposure to low doses. Rogers later reclaimed the Captain America title.\n\nAfter this, the Skull was attacked by the mutant terrorist Magneto, a Jewish Holocaust survivor who wanted to punish him for his involvement in Hitler's regime. Magneto buried him alive with enough water for a few months. The Skull remained there until he was rescued by his henchman Crossbones.\n\nRed Skull had control over multiple criminal organizations, including the Watchdogs, a group of right-wing militiamen, and the Scourge of the Underworld, an organization devoted to murdering super villains. He proposed an alliance with the Kingpin of Crime (Wilson Fisk), one of New York City's top organized crime bosses, to bring a new designer drug to New York but the Kingpin refused to form an alliance with a Nazi. Fisk defeated the Skull in hand to hand combat, sparing his life on the condition he never come near the Kingpin's territory again. However fellow Nazi Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, leader of the terrorist organization HYDRA, gratefully allowed the Skull the use of HYDRA's resources after the Skull's agents brought Strucker back from the dead.\n\nRecently, Red Skull manipulated his way into the position of Secretary of State, under the alias of Dell Rusk. Rusk developed a biological weapon he tested at Mount Rushmore, releasing a deadly spreading contagion \"red zone\" but was bested by Captain America and the Avengers. Desiring the Skull's Cosmic Cube for himself, former Soviet general Aleksander Lukin hired Rogers' former WWII sidekick, Bucky (now known as the Winter Soldier) to assassinate the Skull. When the Skull was shot, he attempted to use the Cube to switch bodies with Lukin to survive, but the cube was weak. The transfer was only partially successful as the Skull only managed to transfer his mind into Lukin's body; now the minds of the two enemies were trapped together in the same body. The Skull/Lukin formed numerous alliances with other villains, including Doctor Faustus, Doctor Doom, Arnim Zola and the Serpent Squad. The Skull used hypnotist Dr. Faustus to help arrange Captain America's assassination. Under Faustus' influence, former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and Cap's occasional girlfriend Sharon Carter was brainwashed into killing Captain America herself. Freed from his ever-present nemesis, the Red Skull/Lukin raised a private army while attempting to arrange for Senator Gordon Wright to become president of the USA. The Winter Soldier became the new Captain America and overcame their plans. Arnim Zola transferred the Red Skull's mind out of Lukin's body and into one of his own spare android forms as a temporary measure. Shortly afterward, Lukin was killed by Sharon Carter and Zola was seemingly destroyed. The Red Skull remains trapped in Zola's spare body.",

      "biography": "Aleksei Sytsevich was just another thug in the Russian Mafia, grasping at dreams of easy money, and headed for a short brutal life. Seduced by promises of wealth and power, Aleksei underwent a life-threatening series of chemical and radiation treatments to transform him after several months into the superhumanly strong agent for a collective of professional spies - in part, to support his family. Aleksei's powerful armor permanently bonded to his form, was modeled after the hide of a rhinoceros. Two scientists named Igor and Georgi chose this form, both for its visual impact and in recognition of the fact that the rhino is the result of countless generations of evolution towards the ultimate form for armored assault. They selected Aleksei for his muscular physique and low intelligence, which they believed would insure his loyalty.\n\nGiven the code-name Rhino, his first mission was to kidnap astronaut John Jameson, son of Daily Bugle publisher&nbsp;J. Jonah Jameson, and sell him to the highest bidder. He received intensive sub-hypnotic training in American English and false citizenship papers bearing the name Alex O'Hirn. Feeling cocky, he turned on his benefactors, destroying their headquarters, and attempted to abduct Jameson under his own initiative. As the Rhino made his way towards New York City,&nbsp;Spider-Man&nbsp;began to formulate how to defeat this apparently unstoppable foe. His discovered two key factors: once charging, the Rhino cannot change directions or easily halt his advance. Second, Aleksei is rather dumb. Spider-Man deduced that if he could avoid a direct hit from the Rhino's horn, his superior tactical skills and agility would always leave him the final victor in any fair fight.\n\nSpider-Man defeated the Rhino sending the villain to a special state correctional hospital where he was kept under heavy sedation. After a few weeks, the Rhino broke out of the hospital and escaped, seeking revenge of Spider-Man. This time, Spider-Man defeated him using a specially-formulated version of his web fluid, devised with the aid of&nbsp;Dr. Curt Connors, that contained encapsulated acid pellets whose containers dissolved upon contact with air. The special webbing rendered the Rhino's costume weak and brittle, which deprived him of needed impact resistance. The Rhino was recaptured, tried, and convicted. The Rhino served a commuted sentence and was discharged. When he was released, the spies who had transformed him, apparently showing no sign of malice towards his betrayal, approached him with the offer to strengthen him using a gamma-ray process. They had also devised an improved, acid-resistant material rhinoceros suit. Having no other prospects of gainful employment, the Rhino accepted the offer. The new series of radiation treatments were successful and doubled the Rhino's previous strength level. The augmented Rhino's first mission was to abduct&nbsp;Dr. Bruce Banner, an authority on biochemical gamma-ray experimentation, also known as the Hulk. The spies planned to coerce Banner into developing an army of gamma-ray treated superhuman assassins. When the Rhino tried to abduct Banner, Banner transformed into the Hulk and overpowered the Rhino. Again, Rhino was sent to a state facility under heavy sedation and high security.\n\nThe Rhino's battle with the Hulk came to the attention of the Leader, one of the Hulk's foremost enemies, who decided that further gamma-ray treatments would give the Rhino enough power to overcome the Hulk. The Leader freed the Rhino from the state facility, and further increased his strength by gamma-ray bombardments. The Leader then dispatched the Rhino to crash the wedding of Bruce Banner and Betty Ross. Succeeding in interrupting the wedding, the Rhino engaged in battle with the Hulk when the Leader accidentally shot him with a radiation blast intended for the Hulk. The Rhino turned on the Leader and caused the Leader's escape module to explode. (Banner's wedding to Ross was subsequently delayed for several years.) The Rhino was left comatose but otherwise unharmed and taken to a state hospital. The Leader used his mental energies to revive him, and reoutfitted him to battle the Hulk once again - this time with the Leader's mind controlling his every move. When the Leader released the Rhino, Aleksei was aboard a space shuttle battling the Hulk. The fight continued until the shuttle crash landed on the&nbsp;High Evolutionary's artificial planet on the opposite side of the sun called Counter-Earth. While the ship automatically repaired its damage, the Leader telemetrically signaled for it to return. The Hulk fought his way back on, the Rhino in tow. When the ship crash landed back on Earth, the Rhino lay buried in the wreckage for some time until he revived.\n\nThe Rhino was then recruited by Egghead, as part of the criminal scientist's Emissaries of Evil. The Rhino was paired off with&nbsp;Solarr&nbsp;and sent to&nbsp;Dr. Strange's sanctum to fetch the Star of Capistan, a jewel of power that Egghead mistakenly thought Strange had. The mission brought the Rhino in conflict with his old nemesis, the Hulk, as well as the&nbsp;Defenders. The Rhino was ultimately defeated by the Red Rajah, a being in possession of Dr. Strange. He later battled and was defeated by&nbsp;Doc Samson, and subsequently taken for study to Project: PEGASUS, an enormous energy research facility in upstate, New York. After months of observations, the Rhino joined in a mass escape attempt along with fellow prisoners&nbsp;Moonstone,&nbsp;Blackout, andElectro. The escape was thwarted by the&nbsp;Avengers. While being transferred to another facility, the Rhino was freed by the&nbsp;Miracle Man&nbsp;who wanted the Rhino to help him regain his mystical powers. The Rhino did not wish to be freed, however, preferring to seek medical treatment to remove his costume which had affixed itself to his skin following he fiery shuttle crash. With the aid of the&nbsp;Thing, the Rhino opposed the Miracle Man, and accompanied the Thing back to PEGASUS where they again attempted to transfer him to the medical facility as arranged.\n\nThe Rhino was hired by the Green Goblin (Harry Osborn) hoping to earn cash to return to his homeland and convince his family to return back to America with him. Hired to scare Peter Parker, the Rhino was severely beaten by a furious Spider-Man. The Rhino's family was disgusted to learn the means Aleksei was using to gather funds.\n\nWhen the treatments failed to restore him to normal, the Rhino escaped and joined the Beetle's&nbsp;Sinister Syndicate&nbsp;to earn money to finance further operations. With teammates&nbsp;Speed Demon,&nbsp;Hydro-Man, and Boomerang, the Syndicate nearly overpowered Spider-Man until the timely rescue of the then-reformed&nbsp;Sandman&nbsp;working for&nbsp;Silver Sable.\n\nThe Syndicate reunited again, though soon fell apart due to the machinations of&nbsp;Leila Davis&nbsp;seeking revenge against the Beetle, whom she held partly responsible for the death of her husband, the&nbsp;Ringer. Rhino hoped again to use earnings in the Syndicate to remove his suit. The team fell apart and the Rhino, working for the&nbsp;Kingpin, was double-crossed. Rhino, overhearing the scientists who were instructed not to take remove the suit, kidnapped one of the scientist's children, and had his suit finally removed. The Kingpin, not one to be outdone, sent a fake-explosive package to the now more vulnerable Aleksei, letting him know he could always kill him if need be. Rhino, missing the excitement in life, requested&nbsp;Justin Hammer&nbsp;to make him a new removable suit.\n\nRhino later found himself broke and alone during the holiday season. He stole a Santa Claus costume and made people \"give\" him money. He agreed to be a mall Santa, but became volatile when the kids did not get along with him. The Hulk was there, and a fight ensued in which the Rhino gored the Hulk. However, with a little girl crying, the Rhino spent the next few hours at the mall as Santa on much better behavior.\n\nThe Rhino even joined a minor league baseball team, wearing a suit of \"Mecha-Rhino\" armor, resulting in two clashes with the Hulk.\n\nIn the Great Game, a gambling operation run by a group of wealthy individuals who wager on the outcome of battles between their sponsored super-powered contestants, sponsor James Johnsmeyer sent the Rhino to pressure the deformed Spider-Man clone,&nbsp;Kaine, into becoming a contestant.&nbsp;Joystick&nbsp;and Polestar joined the fight while the sponsors wagered on who would draw first blood. Double points were offered for Spider-Man as a wildcard while he tried to defend Kaine. Uninterested in joining the Game, Kaine seriously battered the Rhino while Spider-Man tackled Polestar and Joystick.\n\nIn another scientific experiment, the Rhino attempted to enhance his limited intelligence. The experiment was too successful, rendering him too smart for his own good. His new intellect ruined a romance, and he became suicidal. However, instead of giving up on life, he reversed the procedure and returned back to his former IQ.\n\nThe Rhino battled&nbsp;Hammerhead's gang but was taken down again by Spider-Man. In Canada, the Rhino became subject to experimentation whereupon he was mutated into a half-man / half-rhino creature temporarily. The&nbsp;Juggernaut, attempting to reform his life, stopped the bestial Rhino, rejecting an opportunity to escape his own sentencing. The Rhino was reverted back to his previous superpowered self, whereupon he abducting and proposed to a French female singer/songwriter. Subsequently, after Spider-Man apprehended him, he was jailed in a special section of Ryker's Island prison for superpowered criminals at the same time as the&nbsp;Green Goblin (Norman Osborn). The Rhino was seen free from jail, whereupon&nbsp;Colleen Wing&nbsp;knocked down and apprehended him after she crashed&nbsp;Misty Knight's Jaguar XK8 straight into him. After Spider-Man publicly revealed his secret identity, the Rhino was enlisted in the Chameleon's Exterminators team, and defeated Spider-Man. However, after the Chameleon's arrest, the Rhino was left unpaid, and went on a drunken rampage. However, the Black Cat convinced the Rhino to end his tirade while Spider-Man recovered.",

      "biography": "Richard Fisk, the son of Wilson and Vanessa Fisk, grew up very privileged and proud of his father. Believing his father was a businessman of the highest caliber, Richard was devastated to learn that his father was really the notorious mob boss, the Kingpin. Attending a school in Switzerland at the time he found this out, Richard became determined to make up for his father’s terrible deeds.  However, before he could carry out his plans, he seemingly perished in a skiing accident.  When his parents heard the news they were beside themselves. Wilson Fisk had mixed emotions about the character flaws in his son that would drive him to a suspected suicide, and ultimately thought his son was weak. Still, he did lose his only son, so he became extremely depressed.Some time had passed, and the Kingpin had a new problem to face. A new crime boss going by the name of the Schemer suddenly rose up to challenge him.  The resulting gang war between the two families brought enough attention to bring Spider-Man into the fray, but the final battle came down to the Schemer and Kingpin meeting one another. The most shocking revelation of all came when the Schemer unmasked himself to reveal that he was, in fact, the all too alive Richard Fisk.  Using the money his father had given him, he secretly made his way back to New York, built a car of his own design as well as some special weaponry and he even formed his own crime family. His father couldn’t take the shock and fell into a coma. It was only at this time Richard realized that he did not mean to hurt his father in this way.Richard then joined the international terrorist group Hydra in a way to get back in his father's good graces and eventually rose to the rank of Supreme Hydra. With Hydra's medical resources at his disposal, Richard was able to return his father to full health. The Kingpin then secretly assumed control of Hydra, but it was soon exposed that the true leader of the terrorist organization was the Nazi villain the Red Skull. The Fisks teamed up with Captain America and the Falcon to stop the Skull, and Richard was critically wounded in the final battle. The Kingpin had his son placed in suspended animation only to cure him by siphoning some life force from Spider-Man. After this instance, father and son seemed to be reconciled. With the Kingpin finally recovered, Richard eventually joined his father’s organization with a new attitude and a new name, The Rose. Unfortunately, Richard began to have second thoughts and decided to destroy his father’s empire from within.  He had several allies such as long time friend Alfredo Morelli and Ned Leeds, a reporter for the Daily Bugle and one-time super villain. Again, another gang war developed and Richard committed terrible acts that showed him his morality really wasn’t above his father’s any longer. He resigned the Rose identity and stood by his father’s side as a loyal son should.Unfortunately for Richard, his conscious just kept getting the better of him as he decided that the Kingpin must pay for his atrocities.  Again he, Alfredo, and a cop named Blume, brought about events that would set them against the most powerful mob boss in New York.  Their plan went awry, however, when the crime fighter Daredevil and the terrorist group Hydra brought down the Kingpin first. Alfredo, who had plastic surgery to look like Richard, decided that he would betray his allies and take over as the new Kingpin, and Richard decided to terminate his alliance with Blume although it was really Alfredo who shot and killed Blume. Richard then took a third identity, calling himself the Blood Rose and started a bloodbath with the New York underworld. He even went so far as to try and take out Alfredo, but his attempt only wounded him even though his body wasn't found after he plunged into the water. Alfredo eventually returned as the villain Gauntlet, but his career was ended early when he ran into a vigilante known as Nightwatch. Richard was not heard from again for some time after that fiasco.Years later, Wilson Fisk was restored to power and once again the Kingpin of Crime and Richard pledged his loyalty to his father as he took his place by his side.  However, Richard ran into an old friend, Sammy Silke, who was now part of the “family”, and the two formed an alliance. This alliance ended with a botched assassination attempt on the Kingpin and Richard coming face to face with his mother, Vanessa Fisk, only to have her shoot him dead, eliminating him as a threat forever.",

      "biography": "Rick Jones was a rebellious youth, and one day he ran away from a state institution for troubled teens. He drove to an army test site, where experiments involving gamma bombs were being conducted. Hulk|Dr. Bruce Banner, the designer of the gamma bombs, realized that Rick was on the testing field, and threw him to safety, absorbing the radiation himself. As a result of this, Banner transformed into the hulk. Jones remained with the Hulk for some time, becoming a close friend.Rick was instrumental in the creation of the Avengers, as after the evil Loki took control of the Hulk, Rick was the person who sent out the radio call to assemble the heroes there. He later went on to become Captain America's sidekick.  However, after some time Rick started to resent being on the side-lines, however this was cured when he discovered a pair of alien bracelets that let him trade places with Captain Mar-vell, an imprisoned Kree warrior.Jones was a key player in the Kree-Skrull War where the Supreme Intelligence released Jones' latent Destiny Force. Jones used the Destiny Force to conjure up heroes from Earth's past to battle Ronan the Accuser and his Kree army, as well as to bring about a halt of galactic hostilities between the two races.After the death of Mar-vell, Jones returned to the side of the Hulk, and also briefly became an ally of the Galadorian spaceknight Rom.  He later met and married Marlo Chandler, but not before he had an encounter with the Ecdysiast.Rick was also a key player in the Destiny War, where Avengers from past, present and future were united to prevent the Time Keepers from destroying a significant number of timelines where humanity was deemed a threat to all existence. Jones' Destiny Force had led to a destructive, expansive human race in many timelines. Jones later sacrificed himself to prevent the destruction of all reality, but was saved when he merged with the son of Mar-Vell, Genis-Vell. This created a new Captain Marvel.Rick Jones was also revealed to be the monetary backer of the ex-superheroes team, the Loners.Jones has recently acquired powers causing him to transform into a massive creature calling itself A-Bomb. How this has occurred has yet to be revealed, but Rick has already tangled with the evil Red Hulk and helped the original Hulk - who somehow knew A-Bomb was Rick - temporarily stop his sinister twin. Rick also has some crucial information on who this Red Hulk is, but before he could say anything, Doc Samson stunned him with a blast from behind and carried him away. Rick was taken to secret A.I.M. facility, disguised as an abandoned S.H.I.E.L.D. base, and placed into the hands of the sinister M.O.D.O.K.. It was soon revealed M.O.D.O.K. had used cell patterns stolen from Bruce Banner at the end of his war with the heroes of Earth to create Rick's monstrous side known as A-Bomb. During a fight between Hulk and Red Hulk, the A.I.M. facility was destroyed and Rick helped a powerless Banner escape the explosion.A-Bomb stayed with Banner in the same shelter where they would cage Banner for the night when he first became the Hulk, and Rick had finally exerted control over the A-Bomb personality to the point where the monster possessed Rick's intelligence. Norman Osborn wanted to see if the claims about Banner no longer cursed with his gamma-powered alter ego were accurate, so he sent Ares to investigate. Ares attacked Banner, but it was A-Bomb to the rescue. Between A-Bomb's strength and Banner's intellect, Ares was defeated, and the two left him locked in the shelter. Rick and Bruce went their separate ways, and even though Rick is unable to transform back to his human state, he isn't unhappy about it, claiming he likes to be among Earth's heaviest hitters.A-Bomb was on hand when Banner decided it was time to teach his son, Skaar, the importance of teamwork by organizing a somewhat friendly game of football, but an unscheduled visit by the new Harpy forced them to oppose each other as Rick found out she was none other than Marlo. When the Harpy was finally subdued, A-Bomb took her away from the others to keep her safe. He returned after General Ross was killed by the Red Hulk and attended the memorial service. Rick went on to help Bruce Banner and the Red Hulk in their war against the Intelligencia, but he mainly acted as a chaperone to the red goliath in order to keep tabs on his whereabouts. Using his amazing camouflage ability, Rick trailed Red Hulk to an A.I.M. facility where the Cosmic Hulk was stored, but in an unfortunate turn of events, Rick and Red Hulk were pummeled by the powerful robotic copy. Following that incident, A-Bomb watched as Red Hulk gave aid to Thundra, sending her back to her time and burying a time machine for her people to find in the future. After the warrior woman was gone, A-Bomb attacked, hoping to uncover some of the blurred facts behind his metamorphosis. His mind still hazy from being experimented on, Rick knew Red Hulk had the answers. He just had to trick him into giving them up, and the best way to do that was by making him feel confident from triumph in battle. Rick pretended to lose his intelligence and spoke in monosyllabic words, allowing Red Hulk to do most of the talking. In the next few moments, as Rick continued to take massive doses of punishment from his foe, he remembered being skewered by a former member of the Warbound, Miek, during Hulk's war in Manhattan. A group of supposed S.H.I.E.L.D. soldiers took him away, but in reality, it was A.I.M. scientists in disguise. Using DNA from the Abomination, after Red Hulk killed him, M.O.D.O.K. and the Leader transformed him into A-Bomb. Knowing they wanted to turn him against Banner, Rick's wife, Marlo - already changed into the new Harpy - helped him to escape. Rick was soon captured by Samson before he could reveal who the Red Hulk was working for and was brought back to Intelligencia headquarters. Once there, Samson implanted a subconscious suggestion into Rick's mind to kill Banner when he received a certain cue. Banner realized what was done to Rick and decided to get that business out of the way. He discovered the cue and A-Bomb went berserk. Bruce had re-engineered the Redeemer armor in order to withstand the assault, but it was soon apparent the upgrades wouldn't last as long as he'd hoped. On the run from a killer he let loose, Banner determined it was Rick's guilt which drove him forward - the guilt of causing Banner's life to drastically change upon their first meeting during the testing of the gamma bomb which gave birth to the Hulk. Banner was right and Rick was freed from the murderous suggestion, and even though he thought he was defeated, Banner assured Rick this was a big victory over their enemies.",

Risque began a romantic affair with the mutant in hopes of luring him back to her employer.  Despite developing genuine feelings for Warpath, she drugged him and delivered him to Sledge.X-Force, led by a jealous Siryn, hunted Risque down to an amusement park called Wackyworld.  She nearly successfully evaded the group, but she reluctantly aided X-Force's Caliban when he seemed to suffer from a nervous system attack and was eventually captured.  Risque then led the group to Warpath's, who angrily rejected Risque upon the discovery of her deceptive ways.  Risque subsequently checked on Warpath, but he was on a mission for Sledge.  Later, Risque teamed with the Vanisher to steal the Heart of Pele, a sacred jewel, in Hawaii.  Risque was then impersonated by the goddess Pele, but the true Risque was discovered and reunited with X-Force, who no longer seemed to bear hard feelings on the troublesome mutant.Risque aided X-Force several other times, including battles against the ethereal Demon Bear where Risque and Warpath finally had a chance to reunite.Risque later joined X-Corporation, an international version of the X-Men created by Charles Xavier.  Stationed in Hong Kong alongside former X-Force member Domino, Risque was killed shortly after joining when the U-Men murdered her after she attempted to stop the selling of mutant body parts to be transplanted into regular humans.

      "biography": "After being elected to office, U.S. Senator Robert Kelly quickly met with F.B.I. Director Fred Duncan to discuss the perceived mutant threat, unaware that “Duncan” was secretly the shapeshifting mutant terrorist Mystique, who hoped to learn more about Kelly’s intentions. Soon after, Kelly attended a party at the Hellfire Club, unaware that his host - Sebastian Shaw - was a mutant. During the party, Shaw’s Inner Circle battled members of the heroic X-Men, whom Kelly regarded as a band of mutant criminals terrorizing innocent party-goers. Kelly ultimately addressed the U.S. Senate on the “mutant threat,” during which he was confronted by Mystique and her Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. Despite the X-Men’s opposition, Destiny cornered Kelly with a crossbow; however, Kelly was saved by the X-Man Kitty Pryde. This assassination attempt only strengthened Kelly’s resolve, and Kelly soon witnessed the formation of Project: Wideawake, a covert operation tasked with creating a new series of mutant-hunting Sentinel robots. Kelly then introduced the Mutant Affairs Control Act to the Senate. If passed, the Act would require mutants to disclose their identities and abilities to the government. Ultimately, the Act was rejected as unconstitutional.Later, while in South America to obtain photographic evidence to use in America’s war on drugs, Kelly was captured and sentenced to death by local crimelord Señor Muerte. He was rescued by the government-sponsored Freedom Force team, ironically consisting of the Brotherhood that had previously attempted to assassinate him. Returned to America, Kelly soon married Sharon, a former Hellfire Club maid, and after a meeting with Shaw in New York, Kelly and his wife were caught up in a battle between the X-Men and the Sentinel’s leader, Master Mold. Aided by the X-Man Rogue, Sharon Kelly pulled her husband to safety, but was then killed in an explosion. Ultimately returning to his political duties, Kelly engaged in a televised debate between himself, mutant activist Professor Charles Xavier, anti-mutant movement leader Graydon Creed, and high profile mutant hero the Beast. During the debate, Kelly was surprised to find himself agreeing with many of Xavier’s opinions. Kelly later supported Operation: Zero Tolerance, a government-sponsored anti-mutant initiative, until discovering that the program was violating the rights of U.S. citizens by converting them into cybernetic Prime Sentinels. Withdrawing his support, Kelly became a target and was forced to seek the X-Men’s aid. Saved from assassination by Cyclops, Kelly convinced the U.S. President to mobilize the forces of the international law enforcement agency S.H.I.E.L.D. to shut down the operation.Taking a more active role in his crusade, Kelly ran for president. On the eve of the election, at his final speech in Boston, Kelly was confronted by a new incarnation of Mystique’s Brotherhood. Despite the X-Men’s intervention, Kelly would have been killed if not for Pyro, a dying ex-Brotherhood member who sacrificed himself to save Kelly’s life. Pyro’s selfless act finally prompted Kelly to re-evaluate his stance on mutants, and after talking with the mutant soldier Cable, Kelly became convinced that peaceful coexistence was possible. However, while speaking at a college rally, Kelly was assassinated by anti-mutant activist Alan Lewis, who perceived Kelly as a traitor to humanity.",

Since then—or maybe before then—he has become the most well-known trash panda this side of the Keystone QuadrantDon’t be fooled by his standoffish and morally ambiguous bravado, this tactical genius will put his hide on the line for his friends and the galaxy they defend.The RangerA native of the Keystone Quadrant, Rocket Raccoon began his life as a protector of an unidentified humanoid race known as the Loonies. They came to the planet hundreds of years prior when psychiatrists, searching for a place to house and study their criminally insane away from the contempt of everyday society, founded an asylum on planet Halfworld. Wanting their new environment to be as friendly as possible, the founders brought furry creatures to comfort their patients while they built robots to help care for them. For years, the psychiatrists studied patients on Halfworld before returning home and leaving their patients under the sole care of the remaining robots. As time passed the robots became sentient and longed to leave Halfworld. They genetically engineered the Earth-like animals, creating humanized caretakers to function in their stead, and withdrew to build a ship capable of breaking through the force field surrounding the planet—another security measure left behind by the founders.As commander of the Keystone Kops, Ranger Rocket paroled Halfworld driven to protect the Loonies and animal inhabitants alongside his partner Wal Russ and ladylove Lylla. He knew no other way of life until a big green guy fell from the sky and gave Rocket his first glimpse at life off-world. Not long after this encounter a war broke out between groups of Halfworld’s animal civilians. During his attempts to quell the fighting, Rocket learned the truth behind the creation of the anthropomorphized animals of Halfworld. The escalating fighting prompted the robots of old to return to the asylum and, with the help of his friends and an illustrious toy maker, Rocket cured the Loonies putting an end to the war once and for all. This allowed for Rocket and other residents to leave Halfworld in search of new destinies while the newly sane human inhabitants created a world of their own.Or so he believed…",

      "biography": "Roger “Red” Norvell was part of a documentary crew which Loki smuggled into Asgard, realm of the Norse gods. Smitten by the goddess Sif, Red made advances but was rebuffed. Red handled the rejection poorly, convinced he could not compete with Sif’s lover Thor. Loki offered Red power equal to Thor, and Red accepted, neither realizing they were fulfilling Odin’s plan. Some time before, Odin had placed a copy of Thor’s essence in Thor’s Iron Gloves, Belt of Strength, and the Fires of Geirrodur, so that he could empower another were Asgard threatened in Thor’s absence. More recently, Odin had learned Loki and Hela were trying to trigger the cataclysmic event Ragnarok, which according to prophecy would cause Thor’s death fighting the Midgard Serpent; Odin plotted creating another Thor to die in his son’s place. Red donned the belt and gloves and entered the fire, emerging transformed into Thor’s equal but mad with power. Red challenged and defeated the true Thor, and when Thor refused to yield, Red fired a lethal energy bolt. Joey, the documentary’s sound engineer, leapt between them, and was killed. Partially regaining his senses, Red told Sif he would spare Thor if she left with him. They traveled to Alfheim, where the kidnapped Sif gradually talked Red back to sanity. Realizing he would never win her, Red returned to Asgard to make amends, taking Thor’s place battling the Serpent and dying; Red’s spirit went to Valhalla.When Odin and Thor became estranged, Odin restored Red’s powers, gave him his own Uru hammer, and resurrected him. Red became Asgard’s protector, battling both the Hulk and the giant wolf Hoarfen. When Thor returned to confront Odin, the two Thors came to blows, but Thor later gave Red his blessing, recognizing his bravery and acknowledging that both Asgard and Midgard needed Thor protecting them. Though Red’s feelings for Sif remained, he accepted she would never love him, and they became friends.To fool Ragnarok and prevent the Egyptian death god Seth from destroying them, Odin exiled the Asgardian gods to Earth in mortal form, unaware of their true identities. Red retained his memories, but lost his powers; however, when Thor regained his powers, so did Red. They reunited to find the missing Asgardians, but before they could, Thor seemingly died battling Onslaught. Red tracked down three lost gods before Seth’s minions killed him. This time Red went to Seth’s domain, falling under his power. When the Lost Gods traveled there, Red captured them, but they escaped and returned to Earth. Seth meanwhile learned how to restore the Asgardians’ identities, and that if he destroyed the world tree Yggdrasil afterwards, all the Asgardians would die. Seth send Red to carry out the first part, but when Red restored the Asgardians, he also resurrected himself, breaking Seth’s hold. He hastily returned to Asgard and helped stop Seth. Seconds after Odin vanquished Seth, the extraterrestrial Dark Gods launched a sneak attack, capturing the Asgardians. Presumably freed when Thor later defeated the Dark Gods, Red’s fate in light of the recent, final Ragnarok is unknown.",

When the Brotherhood of Mutants freed her, she joined them, and as part of a Brotherhood cell, she helped bomb the Brooklyn Bridge.

A long-time associate of Ma Gnucci and her mafia cartel, the Russian has raised the ire of many powerful individuals. This has included yakuza hit squads, and even extended as far as to persuade an unidentified government agency to send the Special Forces team Bravo Force to hunt him down during his time in Kazakhstan. Defeating Bravo Force with ease, The Russian released the sole survivor of the team with a warning for the repeated attempts on his life to stop, or else he would come for those that sanctioned the attacks. Following these events, the Russian received a call from Ma Gnucci requesting his assistance in dealing with the Punisher. Accepting this offer, the Russian attacked the Punisher in his apartment, overpowering Castle and beating him senseless, before falling prey to a hot slice of pizza in the eyes. This allowed the Punisher the chance to trip the Russian, then use his morbidly obese neighbor, Mr Bumpo, to smother the Russian to death. The Punisher then cut off the Russian’s head and used it to taunt Ma Gnucci. A short while later, a paramilitary organization under the command of former US General Kriegkopf took the Russian’s remains to their base on Grand Nixon Island. It was here that he was reconstructed using Adamantium, super hard plastics, and a variety of organs obtained from animals such as gorillas into a killing machine they planned to hire out to the highest bidder. One downside of this reconstruction was the need to inject a series of untested chemicals and hormones to help the Russian’s body accept it’s new parts. The side effect of these hormones was that they caused the Russian to grow breasts, much to his twisted delight. Before heading off on his first assignment for his new masters, the Russian requested one more chance at defeating the Punisher. Again the Russian severely beat Frank Castle, before tying him up and throwing him from the top floor of the Empire State Building. The Punisher was saved by the intervention of Spider-Man, who was then knocked unconscious by the Russian and employed by the Punisher as a human shield. The Punisher then used Spider-Man’s web shooters to stun the Russian, before knocking him off the roof, through the pavement, and down into the path of an oncoming subway train. Despite this ordeal, the Russian managed to make it back to the extraction point, and was returned to Grand Nixon Island and reconstructed once more. The Russian was then placed on a 747 to begin his first mission for his new bosses. Immediately upon take-off, the Punisher, who had come to Grand Nixon Island in pursuit of General Kreigkopf, shot down the jet. The Russian survived this crash with only superficial injuries, and then chased the Punisher onto a plane loaded with a forcefully obtained French nuke, destined to be dropped onto a meeting of European leaders taking place in Brussels, Belgium. Following yet another brutal fight, the Punisher managed to hook the Russian to the nuke, which he then dropped from the plane onto Grand Nixon Island, annihilating all life on the base.",

      "biography": "Little is known about the early life of the feral mutant named Victor Creed, although it is believed that he suffered an abusive childhood at the hands of his father who, disgusted by the boy’s mutant nature, frequently beat him and chained him up in the darkened basement of their home. As an adult, Creed took the name Sabretooth, and by the 1910s he was known by this name in a small Canadian frontier community where he intimidated almost everyone. One of the few exceptions was a young man named Logan, whom Sabretooth sensed had superhuman abilities similar to his own. Hating the love that existed between Logan and a young Indian girl named Silver Fox, Sabretooth brutally assaulted her, apparently raping her and leaving her for dead. The enraged Logan then forced Sabretooth into a pitched battle, which ended with Sabretooth victorious. Unbeknownst to either combatant, Silver Fox survived the attack and soon departed from the community.\n\nLittle is known about Sabretooth’s subsequent activities until the early 1960s when served in Team X, a special intelligence unit run by the Central Intelligence Agency for the subversive Weapon X Program. In Team X, Sabretooth was reunited with both Logan, now known as Wolverine, and Silver Fox, however none of them recalled their past experiences due to false memory implants provided by Weapon X’s ally Psi-Borg.\n\nSabretooth had a falling out with Wolverine during a mission in East Berlin in Germany during the early 1960s, exacerbating the already tense animosity between the two. During that same mission, Sabretooth met and romanced Leni Zauber, an operative for another unnamed government agency. Unbeknownst to Sabretooth, Zauber was actually the shape-shifting mutant known as Mystique. Sabretooth remained with Zauber for a month before returning to his Team X duties and remained with the team until its disbandment. He then set out on his own as a hired assassin, earning a worldwide reputation. At some point in the subsequent decades he became a student of the enigmatic Foreigner, head of the assassin guild known as the 1400 Club and one of the few men that Sabretooth respects. Sabretooth was also again manipulated by Mystique, who, for reasons of her own, seduced him in order to become pregnant with his child. However, the resultant son had no mutant potential and was abandoned by Mystique, growing up to become the anti-mutant activist Graydon Creed.\n\nWhile working for the elitist Hellfire Club, Sabretooth clashed with Wolverine in the latter’s capacity as an agent of the Canadian government’s Department K. Months later, an amnesiac Wolverine, having recently been subjected to experiments which bonded the unbreakable metal Adamantium to his skeleton, sought the advice of Adamantium creator Doctor Myron MacLain. Sabretooth, hired by unidentified parties, interrupted the consultation and attempted to kill his former foe and teammate, only to be stopped by Wolverine’s allies. At some point, Sabretooth took up the practice of annually stalking Wolverine on the day Wolverine believed to be his birthday.\n\nIn recent years Sabretooth, although always a violent man, gradually began developing a psychotic bloodlust that overcame his admittedly heartless human persona. As a result of this further mutation, Sabretooth’s features became more animal-like, a condition which eventually corrected itself. He first came to attention in the modern era when he abducted noted attorney Jeryn Hogarth who was rescued by his client, the martial artist known as Iron Fist. Later, Sabretooth formed a partnership with the costumed criminal the Constrictor on an assignment for the crimelord Montenegro. However, driven by his hunger for violence, Sabretooth disguised himself and slew several people in New York City, resulting in reports of a mysterious “Slasher.” When Sabretooth was exposed as the Slasher, he and the Constrictor found themselves fighting not only Iron Fist, but his allies in the super-strong Power Man, the cyborg detective Misty Knight, and the mutant adventurer El Aguila. Sabretooth and the Constrictor were forced to retreat, however the pair later sought revenge on Knight, only to again meet defeat at the hands of Power Man and Iron Fist.\n\nLater, in an effort to prove himself to the Foreigner, Sabretooth tracked down the costumed adventurer the Black Cat, who had clashed with some of the Foreigner’s agents. The effort led to battles with both the Black Cat and the costumed crimefighter Spider-Man, with Sabretooth ultimately being hospitalized under guard. Soon escaping, he was subsequently recruited by an old acquaintance, the mutant thief Gambit, to join the cadre of mutant assassins the Marauders in the service of the enigmatic geneticist Mister Sinister. The Marauders were sent to slaughter the underground mutant community of Morlocks, leading to a clash with the Morlocks’ allies, the team of mutant adventurers the X-Men who counted Wolverine amongst their ranks. In the course of the so-called “Mutant Massacre,” Sabretooth and Wolverine fought several times, with Sabretooth ultimately meeting defeat.\n\nAs his bloodlust increased, Sabretooth hired the telepathic Birdy to help him keep his urges in check, only for Birdy to be murdered by his son Graydon, now an avid anti-mutant activist with a deep hatred of his parents. Sabretooth then slipped into a killing spree, only to be captured by his former Team X teammate Maverick and the X-Men. The X-Men’s founder, the telepathic Professor Charles Xavier, undertook the task of helping Sabretooth overcome his bloodthirsty impulses, just as the X-Men had helped Wolverine deal with his own berserker rages. Sabretooth played along at first, although doing little to hide his contempt for the X-Men, but when the opportunity presented itself, he escaped from his holding cell in Xavier’s mansion. Confronted by Wolverine, the two fought savagely and Sabretooth was nearly lobotomized when Wolverine thrust one of his claws into Sabretooth’s brain. Following this attack, Sabretooth seemed unusually passive, and one of the X-Men’s allies, the young mutant called Boom-Boom, became fond of the seemingly peaceful prisoner and sought to help him reform. However, Sabretooth soon regained his true personality and turned against Boomer and the X-Men, almost killing the X-Man Psylocke during his escape.\n\nNot long after, Sabretooth was recruited by the U.S. government to pursue the malfunctioning mutant tracker known as the Hound. To that end, Sabretooth was instated as a member of the government-sponsored mutant team X-Factor, much to the chagrin of X-Factor’s leader Forge. Unknown to his supposed teammates, Sabretooth was actually a sleeper agent of the government’s Hound Program, under orders to kill X-Factor should they be deemed uncontrollable. He was forced to wear an inhibitor collar that administered a severe shock to his nervous system if he became overly aggressive towards any of his teammates or if he tried to remove the collar. After joining his teammate Mystique in opposing the terrorist organizations Hydra and A.I.M., Sabretooth obtained pills to help him overcome the pain and, after succeeded in removing the collar, he savagely assaulted several other members of X-Factor before escaping. Rejecting the government’s authority, Sabretooth also killed several potential members of the Hound Program, setting back the government’s efforts to control mutants. Sabretooth also clashed with the Russian super-soldier Omega Red who sought to capture the feral mutant and bring him to the Russian telepath Elena Ivanova, whose mother Sabretooth had killed years earlier whilst she was still in-utero.\n\nUnder unrevealed circumstances, Sabretooth had the near-unbreakable metal Adamantium bonded to his skeleton and claws, much as the Weapon X Program had done to Wolverine decades prior. Sabretooth then attacked Wolverine during his wedding to the Viper on the island nation of Madripoor, only for Wolverine to be forced to cooperate with his foe to save Madripoor from an attempted invasion by the ninja clan the Hand and the terrorist organization Hydra. In a later encounter, Sabretooth and Wolverine were set against each other by the eternal mutant Apocalypse, who sought to transform one of them into a Horseman in his service. After a savage battle, Wolverine defeated Sabretooth, tearing out his heart, and Apocalypse removed the Adamantium from Sabretooth, bonding it to Wolverine’s skeleton instead. Left for dead, Sabretooth was found in an extremely weakened state by Gambit and the mutant shape-shifter Courier. The trio broke into one of Mister Sinister’s bases, and, after some haggling, Sabretooth received a treatment to kickstart his healing factor. Gambit subsequently secured enough Adamantium from Sabretooth’s former partner the Constrictor to keep him alive.\n\nRestored to his former self, Sabretooth joined Mystique’s restructured Brotherhood of Mutants in an effort to release a virus that would infect the normal human population. However, after an attack on the Muir Island research base, Sabretooth was defeated by the X-Man Bishop.\n\nSabretooth was subsequently captured by the reformed Weapon X Program, and Adamantium was once more bonded to his skeleton. Sabretooth was used as the Program’s key operative, responsible for recruiting other former Weapon X members back into the fold. Sabretooth recruited the mercenary Deadpool, but failed to recruit his former Team X teammates Maverick and Wraith. Sabretooth was then assigned as back-up on Deadpool’s mission to kill the shape-shifting mutant named Copycat, Deadpool’s former lover. When Deadpool refused to kill her, Sabretooth performed the deed instead.\n\nSabretooth soon betrayed Weapon X by stealing its data on the world’s known mutants, data he used as a lure to recruit two more of Wolverine’s enemies, Omega Red and the cyborg Lady Deathstrike, to attack Wolverine’s friends and family, capturing Wolverine’s young ward Amiko Kobayashi. Sabretooth quickly betrayed these allies as well, teleporting himself and Wolverine to the original and long abandoned Weapon X facility where he taunted his nemesis with the revelation that some of Wolverine’s amnesia about his life was due to his own healing factor, which repressed overly painful memories. Using command codes stolen from the Weapon X project’s Director, Sabretooth utilized a device that stripped Wolverine of his mutant powers. Sabretooth then challenged Wolverine to a supposed final battle during which his own mutant abilities were negated by the same device. Both mutants seemingly died of wounds sustained in the ensuing fight, but once their powers were re-activated both were revived by their mutant healing factors.\n\nSabretooth next set about using his stolen data to murder several mutants, who were under consideration by the Weapon X Program, which soon recaptured him and subjected him to the hypnotic power of the mutant Mesmero to keep him in line. However, Mesmero soon lost his powers, leaving Sabretooth a threat once again. Sabretooth escaped Weapon X a second time with the help of Mister Sinister, then disguised as the project’s lead scientist Doctor Charles Windsor. Returning to his former mercenary ways, Sabretooth accepted employment from an offshoot of Weapon X to track down an escaped test subject called the Native. Outfought by the Native, Sabretooth manipulated Wolverine into tracking her for him, only to be turned on by his employers as they recaptured their quarry. Seeking vengeance, he allied with Wolverine to raid the facility where the Native was being held. After killing his employers and watching Wolverine and the Native escape, Sabretooth swore to finish the job he had started.\n\nRecently, Sabretooth \"allied\" himself with the X-Men once again. He joined Rogues team, alongside the likes of Cable, Cannonball, Iceman and others. Wolverine did not agree with this decision to once again have Creed in the mansion and decided to settle the score with him once and for all. The battle took both of them to Wakanda, where it was revealed to them that they were both descendants of a \"wolf\" like evolutionary scale as opposed to ape.\n\nSabretooth was kidnapped from his captivity in Wakanda by an unknown individual. He was brought to the former Department H (Weapon X) facility, where Wolverine found him in a cryogenic tank similar to the one that Wolverine was in when he was transformed by Weapon X. Sabretooth broke free and killed a de-powered Feral, and severely wounded her sister Thornn. Sabretooth appeared to be more feral and vicious than ever before, and it was revealed that his captor was Romulus, an individual who has an unexplainable connection to both Logan and Creed. Creed faced Wolverine, who was wielding the muramasai blade which negated both of their healing factors; Logan beheaded Creed, seemingly ending his life.",

      "biography": "Sabretooth was a mutant who believed that as men were crueler than less evolved animals, mutants should naturally be crueler and more monstrous than men. He was recruited into Weapon X, a black ops section of S.H.I.E.L.D.  Initially coerced into serving them (he once spent six months as a N.A.S.A. crash test dummy for disobeying orders), he eventually took a sadistic liking to the work, gaining a degree of authority over his fellow captive mutants. Sabretooth instantly disliked the similarly powered Wolverine, and has made an unverified claim that he slew Wolverine's wife and child.When Wolverine escaped Weapon X, Sabretooth was sent to bring him back; they clashed with one another in the New York subway and in Times Square before Wolverine escaped, thanks to Spider-Man's help. After Wolverine joined the X-Men, Weapon X located their Mansion base and attacked it, capturing all of them except the absent Wolverine. Weeks later, Wolverine was recaptured in St. Petersburg. Sabretooth, now enhanced with adamantium implants similar to but more extensive than Wolverine's, took Wolverine outside the base to torment him by destroying files detailing the amnesiac Wolverine's past in front of him, unaware his rival had allowed himself to be captured so that Weapon X's location could be uncovered. A tracker implant within Wolverine led the Brotherhood of Mutants to the area to free the X-Men. Wolverine tricked an enraged Sabretooth in to cutting his bonds, and the two battled until Wolverine castrated his foe and tackled him off a cliff. Wolverine recovered consciousness first, doing unspecified but non-lethal damage to his downed foe.After Sabretooth recovered, he joined the terrorist Brotherhood of Mutants. Though he briefly quit in disgust over Quicksilver's weak leadership, he returned when Magneto resumed control, soon becoming his right hand man. He led raids on the Louvre and other museums and galleries, gathering art prior to Magneto's plan to devastate the Earth. He also oversaw missions recruiting oppressed mutants from around the globe. When the X-Men attacked the Brotherhood's Citadel, Sabretooth again clashed with Wolverine, boasting he was bigger, stronger and could heal any wound Wolverine inflicted; in response, Wolverine decapitated him.Sabretooth recently resurfaced, attacking Wolverine and Storm on a night away from the mansion and explaining that enough strands of his tissue were intact that his healing factor was able to reattach his head to his body.  Sabretooth also claimed to be Wolverine's son, although the veracity of these claims are in doubt.",

      "biography": "Little is known of the life of the woman known as Tessa except that she had lived in a small village in the Balkan region of Europe whilst still a young girl, and that she had spent time in a harem under unrevealed circumstances. Just prior to her teenage years, Tessa found herself caught up in the Russian invasion of Afghanistan. She was forced to learn to fight to survive encounters with both soldiers and local bandits, and took weapons and equipment from the bodies of fallen combatants. One day, Tessa felt herself compelled to enter a cave in the nearby Hindu Kush mountain range. There, she found the powerful telepathic mutant named Charles Xavier, who had been trapped under a massive stone block by the alien being named Lucifer. Initially wary of him, Tessa rescued the critically injured mutant but soon after they encountered a United Nations aid convoy being attacked by bandits. Tessa drove off the attackers and then avenged the death of one young U.N. worker by brutally murdering the bandit that had raped and killed her.Years later, Xavier recruited Tessa at the same time that he formed his original team of teenage mutant students he called the X-Men. Xavier kept Tessa's presence at his mansion a secret as he intended to utilize her own mutant telepathic talents as a spy in his fight for peaceful coexistence between mutants and humans. Tessa's first mission was to infiltrate the organization for the rich and powerful known as the Hellfire Club and to gain the trust of Sebastian Shaw, leader of the Club's Inner Circle at its New York branch. For years, Tessa acted as Shaw's familiar, advising and counseling him in both his legitimate and illegal business practices, all the while gathering information for Xavier. Shaw found Tessa's ability to function as a living computer invaluable and kept her in his employ for many years, even during the time he was deposed as leader of the Club.Early in Tessa’s time with the Club, its renegade White Bishop, Donald Pierce, attempted a coup of the Club's leadership. Pierce kidnapped Tessa, believing that without her Shaw's position could more easily be compromised. She was rescued by Xavier and his team of New Mutants and, upon her return to the Club, Pierce was expelled.Later, Tessa ran afoul of one of the Club’s regular and valued patrons, a reclusive billionaire named Elias Bogan. Shaw had made a wager with Bogan during a game of cards whereupon if Shaw lost, Bogan would win the Club's then-White Queen, the telepathic mutant Emma Frost. Bogan had never lost a game before, but with Tessa’s help Shaw won the bet. Bogan honoured the wager, but knew who was truly responsible for his defeat and exacted his revenge on Tessa, capturing her and branding her face with facial tattoos. Rescued by the X-Man Storm, Tessa soon affiliated herself with the X-Men, acting as part of their support crew. In order to shield herself from detection by Bogan, Tessa consciously shut down her telepathic abilities, relying solely on her computer-like mind to assist her new teammates.When Senator Robert Kelly announced his intention to run for the Presidency on an anti-mutant platform, Tessa met with him to persuade him otherwise by convincing him that his actions were no different to those of the mutant terrorist Magneto. Kelly was not so easily swayed, however, and it wasn’t until a mutant sacrificed his life to save Kelly that he realized his folly.Soon after, Tessa was given the codename Sage by Storm who recruited her into a splinter group of X-Treme X-Men who set out to search for the diaries of the blind mutant seer named Destiny that predicted the future of mutantkind. On the new team's first mission, Tessa was instrumental in saving the life of her teammate the Beast after an encounter with the self-professed enhanced human named Vargas. Sage used a heretofore-unseen ability to advance the Beast's evolution to its next stage, healing him of his injuries and activating his latent secondary mutation.Eventually learning of Tessa's deception, Shaw allied himself with Lady Mastermind, the daughter of former Hellfire Club member Jason Wyngarde, to exact revenge on his former assistant. Lady Mastermind trapped Tessa in a convincing illusion, making her believe that she was once again Shaw's assistant back in the Hellfire Club. Tessa was freed thanks to the efforts of Heather Cameron, an Australian mutant with the ability to manifest various super-human powers depending on what the current situation called for, and the X-Men defeated Shaw once more.Tessa later catalyzed the latent mutant powers of Heather’s brother Davis, who subsequently joined the X-Treme X-Men as Slipstream, as well as evolving her teammate Rogue's mutant ability to grant her control over the manifestation of the powers and abilities she has absorbed over the years.Tessa often used her computer-like mind to assist her teammate Bishop in his activities as a homicide detective, such as when they were called upon to investigate the attempted murder of Emma Frost, now a member of the X-Men and an instructor at Xavier’s school.  Later, when the X-Treme team encountered Bogan once more after a murder at his Alaskan estate, Sage and Bishop were called in to investigate. A young mutant named Jeffrey Garrett was wanted for questioning after Bogan had his family killed and, in retaliation, he teleported Bogan's associates onto the nearby glacier where they froze to death. Garrett fled to the Xavier Institute where he came under the protection of Frost. However, Bogan had secretly possessed the young boy and when Frost scanned his mind, Bogan took possession of her. Sage and Bishop followed the trail to the mansion where Bogan captured them, but the timely arrival of Storm allowed them to escape and defeat the villain.Bogan returned to plague the X-Treme X-Men soon after when he captured and mentally enslaved Bishop, hoping to use him as a weapon against his teammates. With the aid of several of their former allies the X-Men were able to rescue Bishop, which allowed Sage to defeat Bogan once and for all. Sage then accompanied her teammates back to New York to assist in the rebuilding of the mansion following an attack by Magneto, after which they rejoined the core X-Men team.Later, Sage joined a new incarnation of the British super-team Excalibur and later joined the Exiles, however, she was absorbed by the Crystal Palace, recently.",

      "biography": "William Baker was born in a rough neighborhood in New York. Abandoned by his father when he was three-years old, William stole and cheated his way through adolescence. Expelled after accepting a bribe to throw a football game, he was accepted by a gang that ran extortion and protection rackets and adopted the alias Flint Marko.He soon became very successful in the New York criminal underworld, but was arrested, convicted, and forced to spend many years in solitary confinement. Upon his released he discovered that his long time girlfriend Marcy Conroy had left him for Vic Rollins, another member of his gang. In a rage he got revenge on Rollins and started a lone citywide crime spree. Marko was captured and placed in a maximum-security wing at Ryker's Island prison but escaped through an unguarded drainage tunnel. With the FBI and police on his tail, Marko traveled south and sought refuge in a place where he was unlikely to be found: an atomic testing site near Savannah, Georgia. As he rested on a nearby beach, the experimental reactor's steam system exploded, bombarding him with a massive dose of radiation and apparently bonding his body with the sand. Awakening after a brief period of unconsciousness, Marko discovered his newly acquired ability to transform into a sand-like substance he could manipulate and reshape at will. Now easily able to elude authorities, the Sandman was born.The Sandman embarked on a criminal career that led him into conflict with Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, Hulk, and many other heroes. After failing to defeat Spider-Man as a member of the Sinister Six under Doctor Octopus, he joined forces with the Wizard who provided him with a belt that enabled him to produce a variety of dangerous and deadly effects through the injection of various chemicals. The Sandman and the Wizard then teamed with the Trapster to become the core members of the original Frightful Four. The team encountered many defeats at the hands of the Fantastic Four and they soon broke up. Marko later broke out of prison with the Wizard's help, and broke into the Baxter Building, briefly teaming up with Blastaar when he first escaped from the Negative Zone.Marko's criminal career was struck a major blow when he joined forces with Hydro-Man and in a freak mishap combined to form a grotesque, mud-like monster called the \"Mud-Thing\". The creature was subdued by the authorities and transported to a laboratory in Manhattan were scientists sought to analyze the composition of the unusual mud, but determined with the instruments at their disposal that it was inanimate. They decided to seal the substance in a container and dispose of it. As a delayed effect of the analytic procedures, the mud spontaneously separated into the two criminals, who burst free of their container.The ordeal so traumatized Marko that he was stricken with a troubled conscience. Striking up a surprising friendship with the Thing of the Fantastic Four, the Sandman soon talked of abandoning crime. When he encountered Spider-Man fighting the Enforcers, the Sandman made good on his intentions and rescued the wall-crawler. Still a wanted man, the Sandman adopted the alias Sylvester Mann. He rented a room in Coney Island from a suburban family and decided to reform earning money as a contract worker for Silver Sable as a member of her Wild Pack. He joined the Outlaws for their brief time in existence, aiding Spider-Man. Though there was a period of suspicion as to whether his intentions were noble, he gained the public's trust and became a reserve member for the Avengers along with Spider-Man. Granted a pardon for his crimes, he returned to his birth name of William Baker. After he helped the Avengers defeat the sorceress Morgan Le Fay and stop the theft of military equipment, a minor misunderstanding with Captain America caused by his undisciplined temperament lead to his resignation from the reserve Avengers. However, the Sandman was determined to remain reformed. When Doctor Octopus blackmailed him into rejoining the Sinister Six, the Sandman turned against his former ally as soon as he had the chance.Feeling the loss of his partner-in-crime, the Wizard kidnapped Baker and forcibly subjected him to a machine that amplified the underlying dark side of its subject's personality. The violent Flint Marko regained consciousness, and believed he had faked his well-intentioned heroics. He was not to be the Wizard's lackey.The now-villainous Sandman re-formed the Sinister Six to seek revenge on Doctor Octopus, but Venom, turned on his teammates and took a large bite from Sandman. Weakened and poisoned by Venom, Baker began to lose bits of himself until he eventually dissipated. Delirious from his condition, he sought out Spider-Man to exact his final vengeance. In his weakened state he was unable to defeat the wall-crawler. With his last bit of strength, he made peace with Spider-Man and asked that he say goodbye to his mother for him. The despondent Sandman then lost cohesion and was washed away into a New York City storm drain. The Sandman's dispersed body was eventually washed up onto a beach, where his consciousness remained in a coma-like state. Eventually, a television rock concert awoke Sandman, who began to attack the concert-goers. Eventually, the Sandman gathered enough strength to re-form his body, but his mind was still heavily damaged.The Sandman began to split into different versions of himself - his good side, his evil side, his inner child, and his feminine side - each taking on a different aspect of his emotions. With the aid of Spider-Man, the Sandman was able to reabsorb his duplicates and returned to his single, villainous form. However, Sandman once again partnered with Spider-Man. With his father Floyd Baker facing imminent execution for the murder of a homeless vagrant (described as bearing the likeness of Spider-Man's long-dead \"Uncle Ben\") the Sandman worked to rescue or exonerate his father. Spider-Man and the Sandman discovered the true murderer was the monstrous Chameleon of the future year 2211 from Earth-9500. Floyd Baker narrowly missed execution by the electric chair, and was exonerated (though ungrateful of his son's efforts).",

      "biography": "Walter Langkowski replaced his religious faith early on with a belief in and a dependence on science. He attended Pennsylvania State University on a football scholarship, where he met Robert Bruce Banner and became interested in gamma ray research. After graduating, Walter pursued his research independently while accepting a position with a professional football team, the Green Bay Packers, and married Veronica, an actress who bore him a son. After earning over a million dollars, Walter retired and returned to school, soon earning his Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Walter began teaching at McGill University in Montreal and furthered his gamma ray research, including studying Banner’s famous transformation into the Hulk, and Veronica soon divorced him, taking their son. At a new position with the Canadian government’s Department H, Walter worked with James Hudson, whose plans for a new super-hero team would eventually lead to Alpha Flight. Langkowski acted as technical and scientific support for Alpha’s precursor, the Flight, which included Smart Alec, a brilliant man with access to vast amounts of information, Snowbird, a goddess with the power to change to any Arctic animal, and Wolverine, a vicious mutant with a mysterious past. Eventually, Langkowski exposed himself to gamma rays, hoping to gain powers like Banner’s. Instead he opened a mystic barrier that allowed the Great Beast Tanaraq to pass through, and Walter assumed its form, wrongly believing his powers came from the gamma radiation. At first, Langkowski’s brain and personality remained in control of his monstrous Sasquatch form, and he joined Alpha Flight himself. Alpha Flight’s roster would change frequently over the years as they went through phases of government contracts and independent action. Walter studied many incoming operatives, who were generally assigned to training teams Beta and Gamma Flight, for Department H. One operative, later known as Wild Child, had a very unstable genotype and psychosis, but the government shoe-horned him into the program anyway. Langkowski buried Wild Child’s unstable results, figuring he would handle them at another time, though he never put much thought into it. In Alpha Flight’s earliest missions, Sasquatch battled the X-Men, the Hulk, Sunset Bain, Machine Man, Tundra of the Great Beasts, Ranark the Ravager and Wendigo. Sasquatch also participated in the \"Contest of Champions\" organized by the Grandmaster and Death, and, as one of the Grandmaster’s operatives, battled the Chinese Collective Man to a stalemate. Langkowski was consulted by the Fantastic Four for his radiation expertise, and battled the Dire Wraiths, Omega Flight (in a battle where Hudson was believed killed) and the Collector. Becoming fast friends with the diminutive Puck, Walter started a romantic relationship with the light-powered Aurora, a fact her twin Northstar resented immensely. Walter and Aurora’s relationship became complicated when Aurora began struggling with split personalities, one that liked Walter and one that didn’t. In the process of trying to help Aurora retain her more outgoing personality, Walter altered her mutant powers. Sasquatch discovered his ability to quickly heal from injuries after he broke his arm in a battle with the Super-Skrull. Langkowski eventually began struggling with a more bestial side of his nature during various battles, and feared he was becoming more like the Hulk. When his aunt, Lillian Von Loont, left Walter a mansion on Tamarind Island, Walter and Aurora investigated only to battle Loont, who had become the cyborg madwoman Gilded Lily. This mansion would later serve as Alpha Flight’s headquarters for a time. Sasquatch, alongside Alpha Flight and the X-Men, was temporarily cured of his rages by a Loki-possessed Madelyne Pryor. Snowbird, whose mission it was to slay the ancient Great Beasts who had roamed the Earth before mankind, discovered that Walter’s Sasquatch form was actually Tanaraq, and Walter was now losing control. Left with no choice, Snowbird followed Alpha Flight’s battle with Caliber and slew Sasquatch by ripping out Tanaraq’s heart. Alpha Flight pursued Walter’s soul into the realm of the Great Beasts and battled their leader, Somon who killed Aurora, Northstar and Talisman before Langkowski used his life-force to resurrect them. Shaman helped preserve Walter’s soul as they transported back to Earth, only to discover that Walter’s body had been destroyed completely. Walter’s soul took over the Roger Bochs created Box armor as a temporary home and continued aiding Alpha Flight. Seeking a physical body, Walter entered the interdimensional Crossroads and briefly possessed the Hulk, but his soul was left adrift when he refused to displace his old friend Bruce Banner’s spirit. Months later, Walter found Omega Flight’s now-mindless Smart Alec in the Crossroads, possessed him, and returned to Earth.During his absence, Snowbird had been killed, and the evil Pestilence had reanimated her albino Sasquatch form and attacked Alpha. Walter inhabited the Box armor again and aided his team, who were shocked to find him alive. At the battle’s end, Smart Alec’s form had been crushed and the Sasquatch form left empty, so Walter transferred his soul to the Sasquatch form; however, when he returned the Sasquatch body to human state, he found himself in a woman’s form. Deciding to call himself Wanda, Langkowski rejoined the team, possessing none of Snowbird’s powers except the ability to transform into the Sasquatch. Aurora was distressed at Langkowski’s return as a woman and attempted to get the flesh-altering Lionel Jeffries to alter Wanda’s form to a man again, but this failed due to Wanda’s body having Snowbird’s godly attributes. Wanda struggled to adjust to her new form, and, after batting Bedlam, was overcome by a mysterious force and helped resurrect four of the Great Beasts. Overcoming the temptation to join them, Sasquatch helped Alpha Flight banish the Beasts back to their realm. After brief jaunts through space and Dream Queen’s dimension, Wanda sought to reclaim Langkowski’s fortune to help fund Alpha Flight, but the fortune had been willed to Veronica; unable to prove she was Walter, Wanda left the fortune in Veronica’s hands. In final battle with the Dream Queen, Sasquatch was bewitched to be loyal to the villain until Snowbird’s spirit freed Sasquatch from the spell and changed Wanda’s form back into Walter’s; this also changed the albino Sasquatch form back into the orange one, and enabled Walter to reclaim his fortune. The team battled Llan the Sorcerer, a villain who briefly broke both of Sasquatch’s arms (though the injury soon healed). When Alpha Flight restructured itself, Sasquatch was assigned to both Alpha Flight and Gamma Flight, in the latter as Biotech research and development. When Wild Child joined the team as Weapon Omega, Walter struggled with guilt over his part in Wild Child’s origins and the truth soon came out, causing several team members to distrust Sasquatch. Alpha Flight continued to act as super-heroes despite breaking ties with the Canadian government over the newly instituted Super Powers Act. Struggling with all he had lost over the years by devoting all his time to Alpha Flight, Sasquatch was easily drawn into following the mystical Goddess, the \"good\" side of Adam Warlock’s soul, who controlled Sasquatch and others into battling fellow heroes for her cause. Remembering his doubts regarding religion, Sasquatch shook off the Goddess’s influence with Shaman’s help, and the Goddess was soon defeated. Though Alpha Flight soon disbanded, Walter continued his gamma ray research at Project Michelangelo in Antarctica. Months later, the mercenary Deadpool attacked the base and caused the core to overload, endangering the entire world, so Sasquatch and Deadpool teamed up to shut it down. The Canadian government, in forming a new Alpha Flight, discovered a true bestial Sasquatch in the woods and assumed it was Walter. Finding ways to subdue the beast, they had this Sasquatch participate in team missions until it was killed while battling Ecliptic’s Zodiac, and the team held a funeral for Walter. Still in Antarctica and unaware of the new team, Walter discovered corruption in the Canadian government. Sasquatch helped gather some of the original team and the group exposed the corrupt government program, then stayed on to rejoin Alpha Flight. While aiding Wolverine (actually a Skrull imposter)in a battle against A.I.M. (Advanced Idea Mechanics), Alpha Flight was shocked to find Snowbird alive again. Walter and Aurora became romantically involved once more, but Aurora was soon terrorized by Mauvais and kidnapped by the corrupt Weapon X program, leaving no trace of her whereabouts. When Alpha Flight went up against the X-Men again, Sasquatch briefly donned battle armor that allowed him to defeat a weakened Juggernaut.When all of his teammates were captured by the alien Plodex, Sasquatch recruited new heroes, formed a new Alpha Flight and rescued his former teammates. The former Alpha Flight members left for space, leaving Sasquatch’s team to take their place, move into the Plodex base, and sever ties with the Canadian government once again. Alpha Flight embarked on a complicated time travel adventure before the original Alpha Flight members returned and rejoined the team. After speaking at Northstar’s funeral and battling Sabretooth and Wendigo, Sasquatch briefly participated in S.H.I.E.L.D.’s Howling Commandos team. He later accompanied Alpha Flight in investigating the powerful mutant Collective, but they swiftly fell before his assault. His teammates Guardian, Major Mapleleaf, both Pucks, Vindicator, and Shaman, were all apparently killed and Alpha Flight was disbanded in the wake of the tragedy. However, a new team was quickly assembled by CSIS to replace them, this time called Omega Flight. Sasquatch was selected to serve as team leader of the new group, charged with the mission to defend Canada's border against criminals fleeing from the American Superhuman Registration Act. When the American super-villain team the Wrecking Crew invaded Canada, Sasquatch confronted them solo, only to suffer a severe beating at their hands.",

      "biography": "While on an expedition to Tierra del Fuego, geneticist/psychologist Dr. Karl Lykos was bitten by a mutated pterodactyl from the prehistoric Savage Land which infected him with a genetic virus that forced upon him the need to drain the life energy of others to survive. Lykos eventually became a hypnotherapist, and constructed a device to help drain his patients’ energies. After absorbing the energy of the mutant Havok, Lykos was transformed for the first time into the pterodactyl-like Sauron, named after the arch-villain of Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings novels. He battled the X-Men, but soon began reverting back to Lykos and fled. Later, as Sauron, he attempted to kill his own lover Tanya Andersson, but was again opposed by the X-Men. As Lykos, he became despondent over his behavior, and after she and the X-Men found him he ran over a precipice and was believed dead.Lykos survived and journeyed to the Savage Land where he once again fought the X-Men as Sauron. For a time, as Lykos, he proved an ally to both the X-Men and Ka-Zar. Ultimately reverting to his Sauron form, he usurped the leadership of the Savage Land Mutates and opposed Ka-Zar, Spider-Man, and the X-Men. Defeated, he reverted to human form again and was reunited with Tanya. Later, he and Tanya were captured by the Toad who was seeking recruits for a new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. Forced to absorb Tanya’s energy (possibly fatally), Lykos was transformed into Sauron again and joined the Brotherhood in opposing first X-Force and then X-Factor. After the Brotherhood disbanded, Sauron returned to the Savage Land and, with the Mutates, opposed various members of the X-Men. Capturing Cyclops and Havok, Sauron drained their energies which caused him to mutate further. Jean Grey engaged Sauron telepathically, allowing Lykos’ personality to force his alter ego’s psyche in making a suicide leap into the abyss of his own mind, thus reducing Sauron’s physical form to a pure, animal-like state.Sauron’s suppressed persona eventually returned and he sought out the X-Men. Defeated once more, he was subsequently recruited into the new Weapon X Project as a field agent, but after the Project was torn apart by internal feuding he was incarcerated in the maximum security superhuman prison the Raft. The Mutates engineered a breakout of the Raft’s other inmates as a cover for Sauron’s escape, and he returned to the Savage Land where he and the Mutates became involved with a rogue S.H.I.E.L.D. faction illegally stockpiling Vibranium. Opposed by Wolverine and a new Avengers team, Lykos was stabbed by Wolverine before transforming into Sauron. The fight was interrupted by S.H.I.E.L.D. troopers led by the Black Widow (Belova), who shot Sauron in the head. The stress of his wounds caused Sauron’s powers to mutate further, but he was still defeated and remanded into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. They in turn handed Sauron back to Weapon X.",

      "biography": "Ben Reilly was the most genetically stable of the many clones of Spider-Man created by Professor Miles Warren, the Jackal. Warren created clones of Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy from tissue samples he had obtained from a class experiment. After many failed attempts, most notably Kaine, Warren succeeded in creating a clone that did not suffer cellular degeneration. The Jackal pitted this clone against Spider-Man in a deathtrap involving a bomb and Ned Leeds. The Jackal on scene, a clone of Warren, repented and saved Ned, dying as a result. With both Spider-Man and Spider-Man's clone unconscious, the real Jackal emerged, found who he thought was the real Spider-Man, and injected him with a drug to simulate death. The other Spider-Man awoke and dropped the \"dead\" body in a smokestack, where the Jackal implanted it with clone memories. However, his assistant, Seward Trainer, himself coerced by the Green Goblin, had deceived the Jackal. The Spider-Man the Jackal recovered was the clone after all. The clone spent five years wandering the country. During this time he met Janine Godbe, the love of his life. Janine, as a child, had been horribly abused by her father. She could bear it no longer, and she killed her father. She then met Ben Reilly. Their love was short-lived, as Janine apparently died.Reviving and returning home, the clone discovered the other Peter already there. Now believing himself the imposter, the clone named himself after \"Uncle\" Ben and \"Aunt\" May Parker (née Reilly) and spent the next five years wandering, eventually developing new weapons for his occasional confrontations with Kaine and other criminals. He also met and was befriended by Seward Trainer. Ben anonymously called to check up on Aunt May occasionally, but did not return to New York until he heard that she had been hospitalized. Upon his return to New York, Ben saved a young girl's life as well as stopped a burglar at a small corner shop. He learned that Venom was back, and decided that he could not stand by without doing something. He adopted a new all red costume with a blue sleeveless hooded sweatshirt and was dubbed the Scarlet Spider. His return later triggered the release from stasis of the Jackal, who raised the possibility that Peter, not Ben, was the clone. When Seward Trainer, following up his earlier deception of the Jackal, announced that Ben was indeed the original Spider-Man, Ben assured Peter he had no intention of taking back his life. Together, Peter and Ben stopped the Jackal’s plan to unleash the Carrion virus on the world. Originally distrustful of each other, the two Spider-Men developed an uneasy alliance that slowly grew to strong friendship. They introduced each other as cousins and considered themselves brothers. As Peter considered the impending responsibility of fatherhood, he relinquished the title of Spider-Man to Ben. But Ben created his own life, bleaching his hair and working at a coffee shop.  As Spider-Man, Ben slightly modified the classic costume. For a period of time, Ben was taken over by the Carnage symbiote and became Spider-Carnage, however the symbiote eventually returned to Cletus Kassady.The degenerating clone known as Kaine always hated Ben Reilly, believing that Ben was the original. After a series of brutal battles, Kaine gave up and surrendered to the police after being saved by Reilly. During these battles, Janine returned after having faked her own death. During these same battles, Janine apparently died again, when in reality, she had been kidnapped by Kaine. After being rescued by Ben, she stopped running and gave herself up to the police.Believing to the end that he was the real Spider-Man, Ben was killed by the Green Goblin (Norman Osborn), sacrificing his life to save Peter from the impaling spike of the Goblin's glider. Ben's body degenerated into dust immediately after his death, proving that he was the clone after all, and not Peter Parker. However, this death is not consistent with clone degeneration, nor Ben's status as the one perfect clone.",

      "biography": "Hudak was a research chemist who fell into trouble and couldn’t get himself out of it. He was wrongly blamed for embezzlement within the company, and his world crumbled around him. Hoping for revenge, he created an armored suit with flame-throwing equipment, attacking his former company as the Scorcher. He was opposed by a young Spider-Man in one of his first outings, defeated and left for the police to imprison. It was later revealed that the Scorcher was operating as an agent of the corrupt industrialist Norman Osborn (who would later become the Green Goblin). The Scorcher escaped prison to pursue his arsonist crimes by creating a protection racket, but he was again defeated by Spider-Man. Once, he was seen attacking patrons laden with Christmas gifts, but he was easily defeated by Spider-Man (Ben Reilly) who was passing by.At some point, he was invited to join the Crimson Cowl's Masters of Evil, and he accepted, hoping to get rich through the Masters' blackmail scheme using global weather control. The team was defeated and apprehended by the Thunderbolts, and the Scorcher was among those remanded to custody.The Scorcher returned as a contract criminal, accepting the job to kill Matt Murdock, whose secret identity of Daredevil became known to the public despite his attempts to deny it. He and a new Diamondback hoped to confront Murdock but were scared off by Spider-Man and Daredevil. He immediately was forced by Lucia von Bardas to band together with other supervillains who used technology she helped provide in their equipment.  The villains began a massive attack against SHIELD and dozens of New York’s heroes, and the Scorcher was taken down by Daredevil. The Scorcher, distraught, continued to profess his unwillingness in it all. The battle turned out to be part of von Bardas’ ploy to assemble the heroes in one place. She triggered a device common to all the villains in the technology they used, and she and the villains were linked together in a giant bomb over the city. SHIELD agent Daisy Johnson was able to kill von Bardas, defusing the bomb, and the villains were remanded to custody. While in SHIELD custody, Hudak admitted to his inteviewer that he wanted to start a new life and offered his services to SHIELD. He revealed that he had an ex-wife, Kali, and son, and he was in contact with them, urging them to flee the city because he knew about von Bardas’ plan. In a letter to Kali, he promised to reform and leave the criminal life he always felt forced to be in.",

Scientist Supreme Monica Rapuccini considers her a daughter, she grew up with adoptive parents, who were also agents of A.I.M., never knowing of her or their involvement with the organization. Carmilla considered herself a normal teen until her latent powers manifested on the night of her prom. Her mutated arm, which she has taken to calling her stinger, discharged a highly concentrated dosage of toxins, killing her boyfriend. Scared of the social and legal backlash she would suffer, she fled her small home town. For years, She lived on the streets, surviving however she could, constantly roaming from place to place. When she learned her adoptive parents had been murdered, she returned home.She came to suspect that S.H.I.E.L.D. may have had her parents killed, and found a birth certificate suggesting she was a princess of the Madripoor Royal Family. After she was captured by S.H.I.E.L.D., she learned that her parents were actually A.I.M. agents, and she herself became an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. under the code name Scorpion.Following information leading to her biological mother, Carmilla learned her mother was 'Scientist Supreme' of A.I.M., Monica Rapuccini. Scorpion infiltrated the organization, learning that she was engineered to survive disease and even nuclear fallout, and that there were others like her.These teens were designed to survive any situation they may encounter, from a global plague intended to collapse industrial society to nuclear fallout. While the other teens were chemically-induced to be completely loyal to A.I.M., Scorpion discovered the mutation which gave her stinger also made her immune. Carmilla lost her cover in the organization when she stopped an assassination attempt on the Vice President.Recently, Carmilla and her S.H.I.E.L.D. handler, agent Derek Khanata, had been sent to New York under orders to track down and capture the Uni-Power before it could fall into the hands of the terrorist organization A.I.M., watching over the spot where a Captain Universe empowered Daredevil fought four Class Three A.I.M. Commandos. Scorpion and Khanata waited to see if A.I.M. would find anything. A group of kids interrupted the A.I.M. Agents work and were nearly killed until X-23 stepped in. The A.I.M. Commandos who fought Daredevil before began to assault X-23 when she became Captain Universe. Scorpion entered the fray helped X-23/Captain Universe defeat the Commandos. Afterwards X-23 began to search for a hidden base. Scorpion joined her so that she could obtain and capture the Uni-Power and get the information on it from A.I.M.; however, X-23 convinced Scorpion to see the light and let the Uni-Power go. X-23 took the Uni-Power to a safe hiding place while Scorpion captured an A.I.M. scientist back to S.H.I.E.L.D. for interrogation.There exists a possibility that Bruce Banner (the Hulk) is her biological father, but this speculation has not been confirmed.",

      "biography": "Empowered by the enigmatic Professor's secret formula, high school student Robert Reynolds became a superhuman. After trouncing the school bully who had tormented him, Reynolds sewed together a costume and made his debut as the heroic Sentry. One of very few super heroes active during the years just prior to the Fantastic Four's emergence, Sentry gained new importance when the new wave of heroes rose to prominence. Almost instantly deducing Spider-Man's secret identity, Sentry became a role model for the young hero, as well as an ally to the X-Men, an equal to Reed Richards and a friend to the outcast Hulk. The Sentry even battled Dr. Doom alongside the Fantastic Four and defeated his greatest enemy, the General, with the X-Men's aid.During this period, the Sentry married the love of his life, Lindy, and took the young Scout as his sidekick; but the arrival of the Void, a shadowy monster that exploited its enemy's greatest fears, ended the Sentry's charmed life. The Void nearly killed Scout, drove Hulk into a rampage, and murdered over one million people in Manhattan. Discovering that the Void had been the dark aspect of his own powers, the Sentry teamed with Reed Richards and Dr. Strange to create a system which made Earth's entire population, themselves included, forget all about the Sentry. With the Sentry inactive and forgotten, the Void vanished.Years later, Robert's memories slowly returned along with the Void, who rampaged across Europe, murdering many members of the Super-Heroes of Europe (SHE). The Sentry contacted his former colleagues, but the only one who recalled their shared history was the Hulk. As the Void returned to Manhattan, the pieces began to fall in place and the Sentry's former friends assembled to defend him and the city. Remembering the dual nature of Robert's powers, Sentry and Reed Richards reactivated the Watchtower, dispelling the Void and making the world forget the Sentry once again; however, Robert's memories of the Sentry soon returned, and he demanded to be placed on the Raft, S.H.I.E.L.D.' high-security prison for super-villains, claiming that he had killed his wife. During a mass breakout at the Raft, Sentry helped several other heroes subdue many of the escaping villains - notably Carnage, whom Sentry ripped in half. Inspired by this adventure, the other heroes soon formed the new Avengers, but Sentry vanished before they could invite him to join them. The Sentry stayed in hiding, but remained a person of great interest to S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers, who were both fascinated by his powers and worried that they may lead to another Scarlet Witch situation.Eventually, S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers confronted the Sentry with several disturbing facts: The wife he claimed to have killed was alive, and the only reference in the world that could be found of the Sentry was in comic books, stories invented and written down by the imagination of a man. Unable to face these shocking events, the Sentry fled. Resurfacing as Robert Reynolds at his home, the Sentry was again confronted by the Avengers and S.H.I.E.L.D., along with the Inhumans and the X-Men. He cried, saying that he had warned them of the Void's coming and that it was now too late. The group was suddenly attacked by the Void. Robert, along with the help of Emma Frost, discovered that the reason no one remembered him was not because of his own attempts to erase the Void, but because of the intervention and manipulation of his mind. Mastermind, hired by the General, had used the great mental powers the Sentry needed to contain his abilities to force everyone (himself included) to forget of the Sentry's existence. Should the Sentry ever remember his life, then he would be struck by a fear of the devil attacking the world, hence the Void. With this new found knowledge, the Void disappeared, and Emma Frost resurrected the Sentry. The Avengers offered him membership, partly to keep an eye on him and partly because they would need his power, which he accepted.The Sentry believed that the Void was trapped in the basement of the Watchtower. When he routinely visited him to make sure he was secure, the Void claimed he knew something the Sentry didn't. Robert believed his wife was cheating on him and that she didn't love him. As his psychiatrist, Doctor Cornelius, tried to probe Robert with questions about his origin and about the Void, Robert grew hysterical and attacked an amusement park. There, it was revealed that-- as opposed to what was commonly believed, that Robert Reynolds was the Sentry and the Void was a separate being-- that it was the Sentry who was the separate entity, and Robert who was the Void. The Void fled, and the Sentry explained to Doctor Cornelius that Robert had been bullied as a child. \nHoping to get high, Robert stole the Professor's secret formula and drank it. Instantly, Robert became the Void and the Sentry was created.The Sentry confronted Doctor Strange, who told him not to approach the facility where he had stolen the serum. The Sentry did, where he suddenly seemed to wake up in a straight jacket, in a mental institute. He was told that his real name was John Williams, and that he had killed Lindy Reynolds. It was explained that he was crazy, that he had killed Lindy because his 'alarm clock' told him to. Robert believed this, until he realised that there was a ring mark on his finger where he had had his wedding ring. Breaking free from the illusion, the Sentry found that the Professor and Doctor Strange had been trying to keep the secret the Void knew from the Sentry through controlling him. Seeking out the Void, the Sentry discovered the secret: The secret serum that had granted the Sentry his powers would have worked on anyone. The Void argued that the world had enough trouble with one Sentry and one Void saving and killing people; it didn't need six and half billion more. Understanding everything, the Sentry hurled the Void into the sun. The Void warned Sentry that he would return, and when he did, he would kill everyone. The Sentry returned home to the Avengers.",

      "biography": "The Kree’s, Inter-Galactic Sentry 459, protected an island in the Pacific Ocean, which was actually a Kree spaceport; termed Outpost Ten. He was a living sentry, trained and placed there many years before by his Kree masters to keep intruders out of their spaceport. But when a pair of human explorers found their way onto the island and opened the spaceport using the broken hand of a Kree idol, the Sentry awoke to guard his post. He froze the two men in a solid, mass of atoms, and shielded the island with a vibro-screen that would tear apart any approaching ship. The screen was also colored using the Kree’s color spectrum, making it invisible to human eyes. The Fantastic Four soon traveled to the island, which Ben picked at random, using a dart and a map, and intended to vacation there. They flew using their Pogo Plane as the airlines were all booked up, and Mister Fantastic’s sensors detected the screen in time for the Invisible Girl to save them with one of her force shields. The Sentry saw them descending and ducked their plane before grabbing it by the fuselage. The four jumped from their plane and fought with the Sentry. He used an instrument panel on his chest to fire a blast ray, but the Thing swiftly smashed his panel, and he was forced to fight using only his own strength and ingenuity.The Sentry created a tidal wave by pounding the ground with his fist, nearly destroying the Fantastic Four, until the Human Torch and Lockjaw appeared to save them. During a fight with the Sentry, Johnny missed him with a fire blast and set off the alien power source underneath the island, causing it to build to an explosion. The Fantastic Four scrambled to Lockjaw, though Ben fell through the ground and saved the two humans the Sentry had imprisoned earlier, and the group surrounded the Inhuman canine, who teleported them to safety. Left alone, the Sentry made his final report, remaining behind with the self-destructing spaceport as the price for his failure.After some time the Sentry was somehow recreated and landed in a small town in the panhandle of Texas where he was reprogrammed by the Super-Adaptoid and joined his team of robots known as Heavy Metal. Heavy Metal eventually clashed with the Avengers and the Sentry was taken down alongside his other robotic cohorts. He was then placed in a stasis field alongside the other Heavy Metal members. A short time later they were then reactivated by Machinesmith and battled several female Avengers. They later escaped from the Avengers compound after a battle between Doctor Doom and the Avengers.Later the Sentry was found and reprogrammed by Ultron to serve him, but was defeated by a team known as the Underground Legion who later reprogrammed it to serve them. During one of their missions however the Sentry was once again destroyed and has not been heard from since.",

      "biography": "Set is one of the Elder Gods, the first beings on Earth, spawned by the sentient Demiurge biosphere shortly after the world had cooled. Already mighty, Set spawned offspring such as Sligguth and Damballah to expand his control of Earth. Seeking further power, Set consumed the centaurian Elder God Hyppus and absorbed his life energy, becoming Earth's first murderer and initiating his descent from true god to demon; other Elder Gods imitated Sets tactics, leading to massive slaughter. Wishing to stop this, the Elder Goddess Gaea birthed Atum, who became Demogorge and banished or slaughtered most of the Elder Gods. Set joined with his brother Chthon against Demogorge but they were overpowered, and Set and his spawn were among those forced to leave Earth; Set left behind illusory forms of himself and his progeny to fake their deaths. Maintaining ties to his home from his self-created extradimensional realm, during the Mesozoic era, Set created a mystical affinity with the dinosaurs that evolved on Earth. Set absorbed the life energies released by their violent killings, amassing enormous power over millions of years. During the late Cretaceous period, Gaea, the sole Elder God allowed to remain on Earth, realized that the dinosaurs had reached an evolutionary dead end and that they were preventing mammals from evolving to their full potential,so she shifted her attention to them, intending to permit the extinction of dinosaurs in favor of mammals. Unwilling to lose his power source, Set ordered the dinosaurs to destroy all mammals. Gaea challenged Set to face her, and Set's spirit appeared on Earth in his first true physical form as a giant serpent created by fusing the bodies of three dinosaurs. Having underestimated Set's power, Gaea called upon her son Atum who battled Set, cutting off his head in the process. Set regrew two heads for each one severed until he had seven, but during their lengthy battle, nearly all of Earth's dinosaurs were destroyed — by numerous causes, some of which were the direct result of the battle — except for an isolated few in areas such as the Savage Land. With Set thus weakened, Atum (who had transformed into Demogorge during the struggle) broke Set's influence over the Earth. As a result, Set, who thereafter retained seven heads, could not return to Earth unaided. Set could, however, manifest in the forms of Tiamat and other dragons or serpents to maintain his influence on evolving religions, thus deriving further power.Approximately 1 million years BC, Sligguth spawned the Serpent Men, reptilian humanoids serving as Set's agents on Earth, and the similar-looking Dragon Kings. Set's other children include Ishiti, who begat the Man-Serpents with snake-like bodies and human heads adorned with snakes in place of hair; Phorcys, who begat Echidna, the parent to the giant, magically-powered Snakes of Many Colors and many monsters of Olympian (Greek) mythology; the cosmically powerful Dragon of the Moon; Tartessus, progenitor to the Snake Clan; and Yamato-no-Orichi, the eight-forked serpent of the Kami (Japanese gods). A pair of early Serpent Men, granted increased intellect by Set, infiltrated a verdant haven created by the time-traveling sorcerer Sise-Neg for a pair of pre-human anthropoids. Descendants of these humanoids visited the haven annually as part of their tribe's migration, and the tribe leader and his mate encountered the Serpent Men (disguised as anthropoids) who tried to convince them to worship Set, offering warmth and protection in exchange for slaying their own tribesmen as food for Set, and bringing Sets tribe to see upcoming \"visitors from the sky.\" Refusing, the anthropoids attacked the invaders, exposing them as Serpent Men and driving them from the haven. Immediately afterward, the \"visitors from the sky\"— the First Host of the Celestials — arrived. Gaea guided the man-apes to the Celestials, who studied them and experimented upon them, genetically diverging mainstream humanity, the Eternals, and the Deviants. The Serpent Men asked a boon of the Celestials but were driven off by Arishem the Judge.Long before the dawn of humanity, the Serpent Men created the Cobra Crown via power drawn from Set to create \"an empire of the Earth\" from the land that would become Valusia. The Crown was worn by Serpent Men kings but eventually proved defective and was hidden under a black shrine to Tsathoggua, a toad-demon ally of Set's. It was guarded by a living stone idol of the Toad-God on the Nameless Isle and would not be found for millennia. Set also empowered the lesser-powered Serpent Amulet and other talismans.Some members of the Elder Race — a seemingly humanoid race predating humanity and composed of numerous wizards—such as Thulsa Doom, as well as certain sects of Deviants, worshiped Set as their god. As Homo sapiens emerged, the Serpent Men enslaved them for an epoch while vying with the Deviants and other empires;demonic races, such as the N'Garai and Undying Ones; or Elderspawn (descendants of the Elder Gods), such as Harpies, Spider People and Wolf Men. Circa 18,500 BC, the Serpent Men were opposed by Valusia's King Kull, who would become one of their greatest-foes, bringing them to the verge of extinction. Kull slaughtered a sect of Set-worshipers and ordered the death of twin infants they had magically created, but they were mercifully spared; the twins, Narcta and Alexus, would achieve vast mystical power before being destroyed 8000 years later.500 years after Kull's time, when the Deviants had established an advanced empire in Lemuria and conquered much of the Earth, human alchemist Atra sought to overthrow them, allying with Serpent Men to create the Serpent Crown. Set empowered the Serpent Crown and linked it to his mind as a replacement for the Cobra Crown. Atra donned the Crown, but Set then transferred his allegiance to the Deviants, refusing to allow the Crown's power to be used against them. Deviant emperor Phraug, emboldened by their new deity, ordered an attack against the Second Host of Celestials, who had returned for follow-up investigation of the human race. The Celestials shrugged off Phraug's attack and caused a massive nuclear explosion that destroyed the Lemurian continent as well as damaging Atlantis. As a result, the Great Cataclysm devastated the planet, ending this stage of world history. Atra and Emperor Phraug were dead center under the main explosion and died instantly, but the Celestials' power preserved their skeletal remains, left clutching the Serpent Crown as a warning about pride.Some Serpent Men survived the Great Cataclysm, but later humans took much of the remaining Serpent Men-ruled territory, setting up the kingdom of Stygia in the process, as well as Acheron, circa 15,500 BC. Set was worshiped by the peoples of Stygia and Acheron (as well as Eldoran and other places). Many of the sorcerers there worshiping Set formed the Black Ring coven. Eventually, Acheron was toppled, but Stygia survived. In the succeeding millennia, Set would also be worshiped by Kushites, degenerate cults in mountains between Nemedia and Aquilonia and remnants of Stygian civilization in Shem. Over time Set developed alliances with dark gods, such as Nexxx, as well as fierce enmities with other gods, such as Mitra and the bird-headed Ibis (possibly a manifestation of Thoth);and other demons, such as Xka'Ahk and the spider god Omm. Set also guided the development of his descendent the Midgard Serpent (Jormungand) of Asgardian mythos.Circa 10,000 BC the mysterious \"Dragon of Set\" menaced the town Solvantha until being driven off by Cimmerian sorcerer Rham-Skot, who created the Sword of Graven. The Cobra Crown was eventually recovered from the Nameless Isle by the legendary barbarian Conan who destroyed the Tsathoggua idol, but the Crown was later claimed by Thoth-Amon, then leader of the Black Ring. Thoth-Amon attempted to usurp the leadership of Zingara from King Ferdrugo, but another would-be usurper, Villagro, seized the Crown for himself. Villagro's untrained mind caused the Cobra Crown to burn itself out, rendering it useless, and Thoth-Amon fled. Set later seduced the turncoat Mitraic priestess C'harona with promises of power, and C'harona manipulated the people of D'eim to build a tower to Mitra, which was actually a drill used to free rat-like demons serving Set. C'harona became a powerful harpy, but Conan slew her, and the demons perished under the collapsing false tower. Conan opposed and slew many of Set's followers in the Black Ring and elsewhere. Eventually,Conan became king of Aquilonia, and he and his son Conn eradicated the last stronghold of the Serpent Men, though a few others survived.Following the end of the Hyborian era, circa 8000 BC, Set's worship continued in what was Stygia (which eventually developed into Egypt as further cataclysms reshaped Earth), but an upstart Ennead death god, Seth, adopted serpentine form and impersonated Set, usurping his followers; trapped in his extradimensional realm, Set writhed in vain frustration. Egyptians would later mistake the immortal mutant En Sabah Nur (later Apocalypse) for both Set and Seth.Set developed new worshipers among the Homo mermanus race, water-breathing humanoids who colonized the now undersea realms of Atlantis and Lemuria 2000 years ago, an Atlantean sect created the Golden Serpent, which magnified the psychic energies of Set's worshipers. Using this they summoned Set but Neptune, the Olympian sea god who served as patron to most Atlanteans, destroyed the sect, though a portion of Set's life force remained with the sects great globe. Neptune set a sea monster to guard the globe over what became known as \"Neptune's Wrath.\" 600 years ago, Lemurian leader Naga had the Serpent Crown retrieved from the skeletons of Phraug and Atra (where it had been found long ago but shunned). Naga embraced the Crown's power and Set worship, and the Lemurians were gradually mutated to have a scaly appearance. Set instructed Naga how to treat the Serpent Crown with material from certain undersea life forms to prolong his life. A group of telepathic Lemurians (later called the Ancients) eventually stole the Crown to end Naga's centuries-long tyrannical reign. They relocated to an Antarctic base containing pre-Catadysmic Atlantean technology left over from the Savage Land's creators and encased the Serpent Crown in metal to dull its seductive emanations. One of the Ancients, Pyscatos, years later gave in to temptation and donned the Crown but ultimately repented, killed himself and destroyed the base in an explosion. Set magically preserved a dynamo of the Ancients, hoping that someday someone would again find the Crown. In 1920, Paul Destine, a crewmate of Leonard McKenzie — Namor the Sub-Mariner's father — aboard the Oracle ship, acquired the metal-encased Crown but fell into suspended animation to adapt to its power. Reviving in 1958, Destine took the name Destiny, calling the Crown the Helmet of Power. Set prodded Destiny into destroying the Atianteans' Antarctic city. Destiny further wiped Namor's memory, leaving him to wander New York City for decades while Destiny returned to hibernation. Destiny re-awakened in recent years and used the \"Helmet of Power\" to run for the US presidency. Insane with power, however, Destiny removed his Helmet to show he no longer needed it. Ignoring Set's protests, Destiny walked off a tall building's roof and, unable to levitate, fell to his death.",

      "biography": "One of the most mysterious and powerful mutants in existence, the ancient called the Shadow King— sometimes known as Amahl Farouk—has terrorized humanity since the days of early man. The telepathic terror has been a frequent and notably cruel foe of the X-Men in his never-ending quest to rule the astral plane, while enslaving as many people as possible with his superior psionic abilities.\n\nFrom the Shadows\n\nLore tells of the Shadow King coming into being when “the first dreams came in night, in the first nightmare.”\n\nThere are conflicting accounts of his earlier days, and the Shadow King may have begun as a being of pure telepathic energy, existing only on the astral plane, while connecting to the physical world using a variety of human hosts. It’s also possible he first manifested inside a human and has continued to leap into other “hosts” since the days of his first body’s death. The Shadow King’s exact identity, and earliest trail of existence, remains a mystery.\n\nThe first trusted record of the Shadow King starts in 1936, while he was in the physical form of Egyptian “mentalist” Amahl Farouk, and involves him plotting with Wolfgang von Strucker and Nazi scientist Dr. Nikolaus Geist to dispute the lineage of England's royal family in order to install a new king who would be sympathetic to Adolf Hitler. Eventually, his schemes were stopped by Wolverine and two time-traveling members of Excalibur, Kitty Pryde and Rachel Summers.\n\nDecades later, Farouk became a crime lord in Cairo, heading up a secret network of thieves. It is here that he encountered fellow telepath Charles Xavier for the first time. While trying to stop a young Ororo Munroe from stealing his wallet, Xavier was struck by a psychic bolt from the Shadow King. Tracking the source of the psionic attack, Xavier found Farouk in a nearby tavern and learned that the assault on his mind was meant to be a warning shot across the bow, to drive Xavier away from Farouk’s territory.",

Xavier agreed to teach Kitty to control her abilities. Kitty's mother insisted she did not want her going off on dangerous missions like Xavier's other X-Men students, or taking a codename; but Kitty immediately ignored Theresa's wishes, considering calling herself Shadowcat and initially regarding the school as a big heroic adventure. This changed after she stowed away on a mission with Wolverine and Cyclops to the Savage Land. There Kitty unintentionally saved the pair's lives when she phased through a sentient computer controlling zombie cyborg hordes, shorting it out. As they evacuated the area, Cyclops was apparently killed. Kitty and Wolverine returned to the States to find the X-Men wrongly accused of being allied with the terrorist Magneto. The X-Men became fugitives, and Kitty was forced to grow up fast living on the run.After the X-Men cleared their names, Kitty settled in to her new life. Ruled by her hormones, she showed romantic interest in her teammates Colossus and Angel before setting her sights on Iceman (Bobby Drake). She was also a big fan of Spider-Man, and when she met him while in New York tracking down the explosive mutant Geldoff, the star-struck Kitty invited the wall-crawler back to the X-Men Mansion to meet Xavier (much to her teammates' chagrin). En route, Geldoff blew a hole in the jet, and Spider-Man was knocked out. Xavier removed his costume while examining him for injuries, and Kitty was intrigued to discover that he was both cute and near her age.Kitty subsequently proved herself in combat, downing an attacking Sentinel in Washington and saving teammate Rogue from the serial killer Sinister, even though she was jealous of Iceman's interest in Rogue. Later, while visiting the Coney Island fair, Iceman kissed Kitty. Rogue caught them, knocked Kitty out, and soon left the X-Men to be with Gambit.  Kitty and Iceman finally became an item during a later trip to Genosha, but she ended the relationship when she found he was still in e-mail communication and in love with Rogue. Realizing she had been interested in Iceman because he was attracted to her, not because she wanted to be with him, she decided on a whim to call Spider-Man and asked him out on a date. After a pleasant afternoon of conversation and crime fighting, they became a couple. Kitty has been going into New York on free nights to patrol with Spidey, during which time she often wears a different (non-X-Men) costume.",

      "biography": "Molly Fitzgerald's father was a fanatically militant Irish nationalist. When Molly was three years old, her father took her and her brother to the north Ireland mountainside as he asked the heavens to grant his son the power to strike down its enemies. Although nothing seemed to have happened, Molly found in her freshman year in college that she was the one who was blessed. She discovered she was surrounded with a protective aura that caused random improbabilities to manifest themselves on her behalf whenever she was in trouble. Rather than return to the war-torn mountains, she used her \"good luck powers\" to become Ireland's super heroine, Shamrock.Fitzgerald's career as Shamrock remains largely unrevealed. At one point, she was transported alongside various other international heroes by the alien Grandmaster in order to participate in a so-called Contest of Champions, but she returned at the end of the encounter. Eventually, Fitzgerald began a career as a first-grade schoolteacher and abandoned her superhero activities in favor of building a better world through education.When Molly's brother was killed in an IRA terrorist bomb blast, her father, long since estranged, asked her to come with him to the north Ireland mountainside once more. There, he drugged her and gave her to the criminal geneticist Arnim Zola in hopes that the mad scientist could duplicate Molly's powers and transfer them to her father. The process unleashed Molly's powers a thousand-fold, allowing her to escape, and Molly soon defeated Arnim Zola. Her father confronted her at gunpoint, frustrated that Molly would not use her powers in his militant quest. Unfortunately, Molly's powers defended her by making her father's gun explode in his hand, killing him. Molly Fitzgerald reluctantly returned to her former life and, presumably, her superhero career.Molly, as Shamrock, attended the first ever Pan-European Conference on Super-Human Affairs as a representative for Ireland. The conference was attacked by the Nazi villain Brain Drain, who brainwashed the heroes present to return to their countries and kill the heads of state. Various members of Alpha Flight raced to stop the heroes, and Northstar hoped to stop Shamrock from attacking Ireland's president. However, her powers made her immune to Brain Drain’s influence, and the president was never in danger. Molly finally took the opportunity to retire from crime fighting when she noticed her luck powers had finally run out-- she actually slipped and broke her left foot! She took up a new career as a hair stylist, soon becoming \"the most sought-after hairdresser in all of Europe\" and serving the likes of Shadowcat and Wolfsbane and Janet van Dyne.",

      "biography": "Master of His Own Destiny\n\n \n\nA renowned criminal mastermind sired a child who he raised as his heir to an insidious secret society and named him Shang-Chi, the “rising and advancing of the spirit.” In a hidden, ancient fortress in China, the boy became adept at both a multitude of martial arts and philosophical disciplines, completely unaware of his father’s evil pursuits. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs a young man, Shang-Chi found himself tasked by the society to assassinate an old enemy of his father’s, but during the mission came into contact with a venerable British secret agent named Smith. The man illuminated the society’s global criminal activities and in doing so set Shang-Chi on a path to declare war on his own father and everything he stood for.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMaster of Kung Fu\n\n&nbsp;\n\nShang-Chi’s training instilled not only wisdom in him, but also forged him into a living weapon, a martial arts master without peer in the world. Though proficient in all forms of fighting, he’s become known for his focus on kung fu and his preference to eschew weapons for bare-handed battle. Despite this, Shang-Chi ability with swords, staves, nunchaku, and shuriken is also masterful.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA natural athlete as well as peace-loving and composed, Shang-Chi may be looked upon as a level-headed individual who practices meditation and inner-cleansing as arts within themselves. His use of chi, or internal energy, aids him not only in combat, but also in mastering his emotions in tense situations. This pronounced calm even allows him to dodge bullets.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMaster of His Heart\n\n&nbsp;\n\nShang-Chi has grown close to several people in his life, most of them secret agents and the like, such as Smith, Smith’s operative Black Jack Tarr, Leiko Wu, Clive Reston, and Juliette. In the case of Smith, the martial artist looked upon the man as a surrogate father to replace his own sinister sire. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThough allegedly a master of his emotions, Shang struck up romances with Leiko and Juliette, but neither one to lasting fulfillment. His friendships with Tarr and Reston both started out on rocky ground due to being thrown together in their mutual pursuit of destroying Shang’s father’s enterprises, but as time wore on the bonds strengthened to the point of agreement on a shared path when they grew disillusioned with the world of secrets and missions.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nShang-Chi has also worked well with several of Earth’s costumed champions, perhaps foremost among them Spider-Man and Captain America. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nMaster of His Enemies\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhile ostensibly raising the young man as his heir, Shang-Chi’s father most always looked upon his son as a means to an end, as well as a traitor and an enemy despite their blood connection. The criminal genius tried on more than one occasion to fashion others into heirs, “sons” who he pitted against Shang, but lost by way of his true son’s shining soul and commitment to end his evil on Earth.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe martial artist has faced many foes in battle, such as operatives of his father’s secret society, drug smugglers, gang members, and super villains, but none of them has he so unswervingly opposed like his father.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMaster of His Path\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter agreeing to work with Smith to stop his father, Shang-Chi met Smith’s agent Black Jack Tarr and MI-6 operative Clive Reston, two men who at first looked upon Shang with a disdainful eye. The young man refused to formally join MI-6 but worked alongside the organization on many missions, including blocking his father’s attempt to knock the moon from its orbit and fighting his own resurrected ancestor, Shaka Kharn. During this tumultuous time, he also met and developed deep feelings for secret agent Leiko Wu, a past flame of Reston’s, and believed he’d shot and killed his father.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nShang decided to put Mi-6 behind him after his father’s death, but before long discovered him to still be alive and the head of the Order of the Golden Dawn. This led to another confrontation between them, one in which Shang-Chi lost his composure and attacked his father with unbridled savagery. From there he and Leiko moved to New York City to seek peace and solace, but Smith and Tarr soon came calling to lure him back into a string of adventures. These culminated in yet another appearance of his father, a battle with his own clone, and the destruction of his father’s fabled fortress in China.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAshamed of his life or violence, Shang-Chi submerged himself into the life of a simple fisherman, but Tarr found him again and pulled him back to confront a terrorist threat. While captured by the terrorist leader Argus, Leiko had her hand cut off and Shang was poisoned to the extent of learning he’d only one year to live. Fortunately, he cured himself with his father’s life-extending elixir and after being declared the head of the man’s secret society, ordered it to disband forever. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nMany team-ups with super heroes followed, among them Captain America and the Falcon, Moon Knight, Daredevil, and the X-Men, the latter of which opposed the Kingpin with Shang-Chi’s help. The young man eventually joined with Heroes for Hire and the so-called “Marvel Knights, but that team broke up in the aftermath of another resurrection of Shang’s father. Seeking solitude from the insanity, Shang dealt with marriage of Leiko and Clive Reston, and a clash between himself and his half-brother Moving Shadow. Following these events, he returned to his solitude, but as always it would prove short-lived for a man of his talents and abilities.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDuring the period of time after the enacting of the Superhuman Registration Act, Shang-Chi joined a new incarnation of Heroes for Hire, faced off against the Hulk’s alien Warbound, entered into a torrid affair with a female Tarantula, and suffered through a worrying and increasing loss of self-control. When his teammate Humbug admitted to betraying Tarantula to the Warbound to be tortured, Shang killed him in brutal fashion, bringing great shame upon himself that could only be purged by leaving the team and once again seeking inner peace.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nShang soon after worked alongside Pete Wisdom of MI-13, tutored the young hero Killraven, faced his father again, and trained Spider-Man in kung fu. Surprisingly, he also accepted Avengers membership offered to him by Captain America and Iron Man, but when exposed to so-called “Incursion” radiation mutated into a monstrous form. Upon regaining normalcy, Shang was held prisoner by Hydra during the time of an evil Captain America’s rise to power in the United States and subsequently joined the underground resistance movement to oppose him.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn recent times, Shang-Chi still seeks peace in his world, though crossing paths with such firebrand characters as soldier-of-fortune Domino while she seeks answers to her past, as well as the X-Men once more, will most likely never get him to that finish line.\n\n&nbsp;",

Traumatized, she moved to America to live with relatives, studying to become a veterinarian; after graduation she worked for the New York Central Park Zoo. The death of a leopard she had raised led Shanna to quit, taking its cubs, Ina and Biri, to raise them in the African Dahomey Reserve, which she protected from poachers and others as “Shanna the She-Devil”.When her father was kidnapped by the Mandrill, Shanna searched for him, but was kidnapped by the wizard Malgato and taken to the Savage Land. She was assisted against Malgato by Ka-Zar, enabling her to resume her search. In Africa Shanna learned that the Mandrill had killed her father; she journeyed to America, aiding Daredevil and the Black Widow in thwarting the Mandrill’s attempted U.S. takeover. After returning to Africa, her panthers were slain by the Cult of Kali priest Raga-Shah; she tracked and eventually fed Raga-Shah to her python Ananta.Shanna returned to the Savage Land and became Ka-Zar's lover.

The couple's relationship was tempestuous: Shanna married a widower, Mele of the Botor, who died in a hunting accident while with Ka-Zar; Shanna was also targeted by the demonic Belasco, who felt she resembled his lost love Beatrice. When Ka-Zar was seemingly killed while they were in New York, a distraught Shanna rampaged, was institutionalized, and nearly romanced Peter Parker. Shanna was rescued by a revived Ka-Zar, aided by Spider-Man, and the two returned to Antarctica, where they were married despite interference from Belasco and others.

Shathra immediately realized Spider-Man’s true nature and determined that he would make the perfect meal for her hungry young hatchlings.Following Spider-Man’s scent back to Earth, Shathra quickly engaged her chosen victim in a battle that demonstrated her clearly superior speed and strength. Though Spider-Man was able to use his superior knowledge of New York to find temporary escape, he knew that Shathra would soon locate him once more.In fact, Shathra turned the game in a new direction, changing to a human form and adopting the name “Sharon Keller”. Posing as Spider-Man’s jilted lover, she went on live TV to reveal a series of convincing and humiliating details. Spurred by Mary Jane’s distress, Peter Parker rose to the taunt, gatecrashes the studio interview and attacked Sharon Keller in full view. Fortunately, Shathra reverted to her Spider-Wasp form, but her gambit had achieved its goal of pushing Spider-Man to act on pure instinct, bringing the conflict to the simple level of “natural order”, in which the Spider-Wasp is the hunter and the Spider is the meal.Spider-Man managed barely to avoid descending into mindless fury and though drugged by Shathra’s paralyzing agent, managed to escape to brief safety. He was rescued by Ezekiel, who took Spider-Man to a sacred temple in Ghana and helped Peter to set a trap for Shathra. Spider-Man now consciously allowed his arachnid side to take the forefront, or enough so to capture the Spider-Wasp, and to feed her to whatever spider dwelt in the depths of the temple. The food chain, it seems, can run in both directions.",

Some sources suggest that Shatterstar possesses superhuman abilities relating to the absorption of sonic and vibrational energy, as well as an intuitive learning capability, but these claims can not be substantiated at this time. Shatterstar is known to have served in the unsanctioned mutant group X-Force, and has been involved in numerous superhuman conflicts.

      "biography": "As a young girl, Shriek had a miserable childhood that eventually drove her to drugs.  Her mother was ashamed of her for being overweight and she was abused by both her parents.  She became a groupie for a rock band, and a drug dealer on the side until the vigilantes Cloak and Dagger happened by during one of her deals. Having already suffered enough traumas to make her dangerously unstable, a short stay in Cloak's dark dimension pushed her over the edge into insanity. After that, she was captured and imprisoned in Ravencroft. According to her, she was also shot in the head by police and while gluing the pieces together again, the doctors apparently missed some.  However, it is still unclear as to how her powers actually developed.  It could be that she already had these powers but they didn’t manifest themselves until she was exposed to Cloak’s darkness, or they could have been a side effect of the drugs she was taking, or it could have been a combination of these events, among others, that caused her powers to develop.When the menace Carnage was imprisoned and escaped from Ravencroft, Shriek talked him into taking her with him. After that, they met with Doppelganger, Demogoblin and Carrion (Malcolm McBride). Shriek's childhood problems of being obsessed with families started to surface, and she adopted Carnage as her husband, Carrion and Demogoblin as their children to which she would teach their evil ways, and Doppelganger became their adopted pet.  Carnage, demented in his own right, went along with this dysfunctional family idea of hers.  During this episode in Spider-Man’s life now referred to as Maximum Carnage, Shriek used her powers to induce everyone they came across in the city of New York to be evil. Shriek and her adopted family had to battle Spider-Man and several of his allies such as Black Cat, Iron Fist, and Venom.  Doppelganger had become close to Shriek and gave his life to protect her when Carnage attacked her for her rebellious behavior.  The fighting within the Carnage Family became too much and with the death of Doppelganger, Carrion seemingly rid of the virus inside him, and Demogoblin wanting to repent for his murderous ways, Shriek thought she too had seen the light.  Shriek was returned to Ravencroft after the events of Maximum Carnage.Shriek attempted to escape twice from Ravencroft. Once, alongside the vigilante Mayhem and a handful of other inmates, she was defeated by Spider-Man and John Jameson before they managed to escape.  The second was when Dr. Kafka was treating the seemingly cured Malcolm McBride, and tried to convince him that he was not insane by taking him to Shriek’s cell in order to show him a truly insane person.  However, seeing her “son” made her snap yet again, and broke free from her specially designed cell.  Using her powers, she reactivated the Carrion virus within McBride, and set out to reunite her “family” only it was too late for Demogoblin had also been killed and Carnage was in a coma.  Spider-Man, after a few trying events in his own life,  intercepted and attacked Shriek with a viciousness she hadn’t seen before, but she turned the tables with her sonic powers when she made Spider-Man hesitate by begging him to stop hitting her.  Shriek sensing the darkness within Spider-Man growing decided that he would be a suitable “father” for Carrion, therefore taking the place of Carnage in her demented family.  With the virus almost completely taken over Malcolm’s mind, Shriek took him to visit his mother because he was still attached to her.  Spider-Man tracked them down and was attacked by the confused Carrion while trying to save the life of his real mother, Beatrice McBride.  Spider-Man now takes his frustrations out on Carrion and just as he is about to fall Beatrice McBride pleads to Spider-Man’s conscience to stop.  It is then that Shriek realizes Spider-Man could never take the place of Carnage and blasts him with a sonic burst, and forces Malcolm to choose who he wants for his mother.  Carrion, more confused than ever, turns his power on himself but something inside Shriek changes as she sees Beatrice McBride go to embrace him possibly ending in the death of both of them.  Shriek absorbs the Carrion virus and collapses leaving Malcolm free of his curse, and enabling Spider-Man to return her to Ravencroft.  After those events, Shriek was treating the virus inside her as an unborn child when the Jackal paid her a visit and removed the virus from her body.It could be assumed that Shriek is still undergoing therapy at Ravencroft. However, she has recently been seen at the \"Bar With No Name\" amongst a host of other super villains making bets on what was inside a mysterious chrysalis that appeared overnight in Manhattan.",

      "biography": "10-year old Maximilian Quincy Coleridge was orphaned when his parents were gunned down before his eyes in a hold-up. Embittered, the youth decided to dedicate his life to fighting crime. Entering college, he studied law and criminology and began a rugged regimen of exercise to build his body to its peak of physical potential. Upon graduation, he traveled to Nepal to the temple of the Cult of Kali to study their martial arts and mystical disciplines. For seven years he studied among them until his masters believed he had learned all he could. He was then prepared to receive the ceremonial \"Kiss of Kali\" from a branding iron whose imprint was in the shape of the goddess Kali. The man screamed when the branding iron was pressed against his eyes, cheeks, and forehead. Believing his masters to have betrayed him, he stumbled out of the temple to bury his scarred face in the snow. When he recovered from the shock and pain, he discovered that his eyesight had been replaced by a mystical extrasensory perception. Inexplicably, he was unable to perceive the temple anymore, so he made his way back to civilization and America, where he adopted the identity of the Shroud.To begin his crime-fighting career spectacularly, the Shroud decided to hunt and kill the Latverian dictator Doctor Doom. Although at one point he came close to his goal, he eventually found himself siding with Doom against the Red Skull, who had launched a \"hypno-ray\" satellite designed to enslave the Earth's populace. In order to stop the hypno-ray, the Shroud intercepted and absorbed the full effects of the ray bombardment himself. Rescued from the oblivion of space by Captain America, the Shroud was taken back to Earth to recover.In the long months it took him to regain his sanity, the Shroud discovered that the blast had apparently triggered the emergence of a latent mystical power-- the ability to summon a volume of absolute darkness at will. He also decided to go undercover, build up his own reputation as a criminal, and destroy the underworld from within. Associating with the underworld of Los Angeles, the Shroud soon gained a reputation with both criminals and lawmen as a master criminal. At the same time, he often would work with various heroes, such as the original Spider-Woman, Tigra, and the Avengers. Invited to join the Avengers as they opened a West Coast branch, he declined, preferring not to compromise his autonomy. The Shroud went on to organize his own gang, the Night Shift. Still committed to subverting the underworld from within, he led the team only in combating other criminals and criminal organizations. Also, by keeping an eye on the other members of the Night Shift, the Shroud hoped to make certain that they did not victimize law-abiding individuals. One of their first such endeavors was against the Power Broker, in which they aided Captain America. Once, however, when the Shroud was absent, the Night Shift battled the West Coast Avengers in an attempt to obtain the release of their captured member, Digger. Dansen Macabre, the deputy leader, could not understand why the Night Shift had never battled the Avengers before. (In reality, the Shroud had previously made a deal with the Avengers not to interfere with his motives for leading the Night Shift.) However, the Avengers trounced the Night Shift, who escaped only with the help of the Shroud, straining his relationship with the Avengers. Eventually, in part because of the friction in the team over the way the Shroud handled the Avengers, the Night Shift mutinied against his leadership, forcing him out.As Maximilian Coleridge, he returned to New York, taking up his family business and using the Shroud as his secondary, secret identity in a more traditional crime-fighting manner.",

      "biography": "Shuma-Gorath is the archetypal Class Three demon, native to an extradimensional realm. He is one of the \"Old Ones\" who came to Earth untold millions of years ago, ruling it and feasting on mankind's ancestors. Though banished in the distant past by the sorcerer Sise-Neg, Shuma returned to Earth and ruled for an age in what would be Cimmeria, fed by blood sacrifice. Over 21,000 years ago, the newly risen god Crom led a shaman to three iron-bound books of magic with which the shaman imprisoned Shuma in what became Mount Crom. Around 10,000 B.C. the newly wed sorcerers Kulan Gath and Vammatar sought to release and enslave the demon, but failed after betraying each other. A century later, Shuma-Gorath was indeed unleashed by the two sorcerers and others, but the barbarian Conan used the Books to banish the demon from Earth.In the modern era, Shuma attempted to be reborn on Earth through the mind of the Ancient One via his agents Nightmare, Sligguth, Ebora, N'Gabthoth, Dagoth, Kathulos, and Living Buddha. Unable to stop the demon, Doctor Strange instead slew the Ancient One, banishing Shuma back to his realm while allowing the Ancient One to become one with the universe. Later, Strange's near destruction of his many talismans and scrolls in battle against alien sorcerer Urthona collapsed the barriers imprisoning the Old Ones, allowing Shuma to gain a foothold on Earth. Forced to use black magic to oppose Shuma's agents - such as Erlik Khan, Ghaszaszh Nyirh, and a water elemental- Strange ultimately merged with Shuma and then impaled himself. This temporarily destroyed Shuma, but Strange suffered the consequences of his dark actions for some time. Re-forming over time as Strange purged himself of the demon's taint, Shuma continues to seek to conquer Earth and other realms, sometimes by acquisition of objects of power like the Infinity Gems.Recently Nicholas Scratch tried to revive Shuma-Gorath. Along with the Salem Seven, Nicholas trapped Dr.Strange and his servant Wong in a dimension so he could not stop Shuma when he returned. In order to create more sacrifices he called the Fantastic Four and brought them to Wing Hill where Shuma was eventually resurrected by Nicholas. However unknown to Nicholas, Mister Fantastic freed Diablo and ordered him to free Dr.Strange and Wong. After he freed the Sorcerer Supreme, Diablo and Dr.Strange travelled to Wing Hill and joined the battle against Scratch and Shuma-Gorath. Strange then devised a plan and teleported himself and Shuma to Stonehedge where he once again banished Shuma-Gorath.",

The cultists mated selectively to produce children who could better tap the Well's power. Over 20 years ago, ruthless cult leader Tai captured and coerced an American military unit into a pact to marry the cult's specially bred \"Daughters of the Dragon\" (including Tai's daughter Miyami) and produce powerful children. The already married Daryl Taylor refused, but the other soldiers agreed, including Andrew Chord, who married Miyami and took her to America. Miyami soon bore twins, but faked their deaths and her own so Tai could not exploit them. To replace these children in the pact, Tia mystically forced Chord to kill his friends the Taylors and take custody of their son, Dwayne. Meanwhile, Miyami abandoned her infant twins in New York's Chinatown, where they grew up as the mystical mutant orphans Midnight's Fire and Silhouette. They joined the Concrete Dragons street gang, but rival gang the Poison Memories killed off most of the Concrete Dragons; Memories leader Kimeiko Ashu offered to spare the Dragons if 14 year-old Silhouette became his concubine, but she refused.In their late teens, Fire and Silhouette were anti-gang vigilantes allied with adventurer Night Thrasher (Dewayne Taylor), who became Silhouette's lover; however, during a bust gone awry, Silhouette was shot by a gangster while Thrasher restrained Fire from attacking an interfering policeman. Blaming Taylor, Fire went into hiding with Silhouette who lost the use of her legs. Fire later rebuilt the Concrete Dragons street gang until Taylor's New Warriors brought him to justice. Silhouette disowned her brother, reconciled with Taylor and joined the New Warriors, who eventually destroyed Tai, the Well and the cult, though not before Tai killed Miyami. Having discovered her true parentage, Silhouette sought a relationship with her father Chord, while Fire and most of the other pact offspring formed the criminal Folding Circle. After briefly falling under the sway of the shadow-powered lunatic Darkling, Silhouette developed enhanced powers; however, she and Taylor drifted apart, and they broke up after he learned she had secretly maintained ties with Fire's Concrete Dragons, trying  to keep them out of trouble. Taylor was further estranged when Silhouette began a torrid love affair with his shady half-brother Bandit, who has long pursued a hateful vendetta against Taylor. Silhouette ultimately quit the Warriors to explore her powers, herself, and her relationship with Bandit, though Bandit has since romanced New Orleans Assassins Guild leader Bella Donna.",

He first worked for the criminal Mandrill and clashed with the blind hero Daredevil. Harada then served the Viper, an agent of the terrorist organization Hydra, as her bodyguard. In that capacity, Harada battled opponents such as the costumed crimefighter Spider-Man, the martial arts master Shang-Chi, and the team of mutant trainee heroes the New Mutants.Following his father’s death, Harada sought the leadership of Shingen’s Clan Yashida from his half-sister Mariko Yashida, but was opposed by the ronin Yukio and Mariko’s lover, the mutant adventurer Wolverine. Later, Harada worked with Wolverine to free American private investigator Jessica Drew from the influence of Black Blade of Muramasa, a sword mystically imbued with its creator’s madness. Wolverine himself fell under the sword’s spell, but managed to overcome his possession after which Harada took up the sword, finding himself worthy of its power.After Mariko’s death, Harada claimed leadership of Clan Yashida and was briefly employed by the Japanese government as leader of their fledgling super-team Big Hero 6. Ultimately, his inability to lead Clan Yashida allowed the Mongolian crimelord Haan Kaishek to take control, and he allied with Wolverine to defeat the Kaishek’s. However, the disgrace of losing leadership was too great for Harada, and he returned to his mercenary ways.Eventually falling into the service of Hydra once more, Harada was dispatched to battle the female ninja Elektra and was seemingly killed.

He was born Norrin Radd on the planet Zenn-La, part of an extremely long-lived and technologically advanced humanoid race which had created a worldwide utopia devoid of crime, disease, hunger, poverty, and want of any kind. Norrin's mother Elmar, ill-suited to this stifling environment, eventually killed herself. Urged on by his atypically ambitious father Jartran, Norrin was raised as a grimly intellectual youth, encouraged to seek knowledge, advancement, and achievement rather than the aimless hedonism which had come to dominate Zenn-Lavian society. However, a disgraced Jartran would later commit suicide himself after he was accused of idea theft (though not before he had taken a new lover and fathered another son, Fennan, unknown to Norrin). Despite his lifelong love, Shalla-Bal, Norrin grew into a restless soul who longed for challenge and struggle, immersing himself in histories of Zenn-La's adventurous ancient past.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo Save A World\n\nNorrin's life changed forever when a menacing alien spacecraft pierced Zenn-La's long-neglected defense systems. Convincing a Council of Scientists member to provide him with a spaceship, Radd soon confronted the invader, Galactus, who intended to consume Zenn-La. Radd offered to become his herald and seek out new worlds for him in exchange for Galactus sparing Zenn-La. Galactus agreed, transforming Radd into a silver-skinned, cosmic-powered super-being patterned after an adolescent fantasy plucked from Norrin's memories. Known thereafter as the Silver Surfer because of the silvery flying board he rode, Radd departed Zenn-La with Galactus.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe Alien and the Girl\n\nThe Surfer served Galactus well for many years, enjoying exploring the wonders of the universe; however, it became increasingly difficult for Radd to find energy-rich worlds devoid of sentient life. Over time, Galactus subtly altered the Surfer's mind, submerging Radd's emotions and repressing past memories. As a result, the Surfer became much more willing to lead Galactus to inhabited worlds, such as Earth. Locating Earth despite Uatu The Watcher's covert attempts to ward him off, the Surfer caused widespread panic and fought the Fantastic Four. During this conflict, the Surfer met blind sculptress Alicia Masters, who sensed his inner nobility and pleaded with him to spare humanity. His long-dormant emotions stirred by what Alicia taught him of beauty and spirit, the Surfer turned on Galactus and helped fight him off long enough for Uatu and the Fantastic Four to secure the Ultimate Nullifier: a cosmic doomsday weapon which forced Galactus to withdraw. However, Galactus punished the Surfer by trapping him on Earth, erecting an energy barrier around the planet that was uniquely attuned to the Surfer.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHard Lessons\n\nThe Surfer became a melancholy global wanderer, trying to adjust to his new home and understand its people. After a pointless skirmish with Alicia's jealous boyfriend, the Thing, the Surfer was befriended and betrayed by Latverian tyrant Doctor Doom, who imprisoned Radd and stole the Surfer's power for himself; but Doom lost his new might when he collided with Galactus' barrier, and the Surfer's powers were restored. Increasingly pessimistic about humanity, the Surfer tried to befriend fellow outcast the Hulk, but the man-monster's violent temper drove him away. Next, the Surfer took pity on the Mad Thinker's abandoned sentient computer Quasimodo and gave it humanoid form, but he was forced to petrify his new creation after it proved to be criminally insane. Convinced by now that humanity was a savage race that could only survive and evolve if the planet were united against a common foe, the Surfer decided to become that foe. He terrorized the world with his cosmic powers until the U.S. military struck him down with an experimental power-draining \"Sonic Shark\" missile, based on technology developed by the FF's Reed Richards. Humbled by the incident and shown the error of his ways by the FF, the Surfer resumed his peaceful wanderings. His powers were diminished, though they gradually returned to their original levels.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNew Friends, New Foes, and Past Mistakes\n\nAided by the Fantastic Four, the Surfer resisted attempts by Galactus to regain his services. He also faced foes such as the alien Badoon, the demonic Mephisto (who became obsessed with breaking the Surfer's spirit), Asgardian trickster god Loki (who manipulated the Surfer into battling his brother Thor), the alternate-future Overlord, mad scientist Ludwig von Frankenstein, the ghostly Flying Dutchman, rogue Zenn-Lavian scientist Yarro Gort (who coveted Shalla-Bal for himself and died trying to destroy the Surfer), the occultist Warlock Prime, the monstrous Abomination, and the robotic Doomsday Man. One of the Surfer's few true friends during these early adventures was physicist Al B. Harper, who sacrificed his life to help the Surfer save the world from the enigmatic Stranger; the Surfer lit an eternal flame at Harper's grave in memory of his heroism. Several times during this period, the Surfer was briefly reunited with Shalla-Bal, who was used as an unwilling pawn against the Surfer by foes such as Mephisto and Gort; but circumstances always forced the lovers apart, sending Shalla Bal home each time. Increasingly frustrated by his situation and disgusted by man's inhumanity to man, the Surfer, secretly influenced by Psycho-Man, became more hostile, battling Spider-Man, Human Torch, S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Inhumans in a series of misunderstandings and misadventures. But when Doctor Doom temporarily usurped the power of Galactus, the Surfer helped defeat the villain.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDefending His New Home\n\nThe Surfer formed a temporary alliance with the Hulk and Namor the Sub-Mariner to oppose a new weather technology that threatened to destroy the world; these \"Titans Three\" completed their mission despite the misguided interference of the Avengers, and even toppled a minor hostile dictator along the way. Namor, Hulk and Doctor Strange soon formed a more enduring heroic alliance as the Defenders - saving the world from Yandroth. They tried to recruit the Surfer for their first mission, but he was recovering from a collision with Galactus' barrier at the time. After aiding Thor against Loki‘s minion Durok the Demolisher, the Surfer helped the Fantastic Four defeat Galactus' latest herald, the Air-Walker android, and the Fantastic Four in turn protected the Surfer by trapping Galactus in the Negative Zone. The Surfer soon fell under the mental sway of Calizuma and his Warrior Wizards, agents of the demonic Undying Ones. Freed from their influence by the Defenders, the Surfer helped defeat the wizards and became one of the Defenders' earliest recruits, aiding the team against foes such as the Nameless One, Attuma and the Red Ghost. At one point, a quest to restore the petrified Black Knight led the Defenders into a conflict with the Avengers, orchestrated by Loki and Dormammu. In the end, the villains were defeated and the two super-teams parted as friends, though the restless Surfer soon left the active Defenders ranks.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nReturn to Zenn-La\n\nTricked into helping Doctor Doom create the deadly Doomsman android, the Surfer helped the Fantastic Four neutralize this menace, and then clashed with the vampire lord Dracula. Later, the Surfer was present at an Avengers-Defenders gathering ineffectually attacked by mind-controlled heroine Jewel. After another clash with the Hulk, the Surfer aided the Defenders against the demonic Six-Fingered Hand and their hellish masters, including Mephisto. After aiding the Avengers against the Molecule Man, declining an offer of Avengers membership, attending the funeral of seemingly deceased Defenders teammates Nighthawk and Valkyrie, and participating in another Avengers-Defenders clash orchestrated by alien menaces Nebulon and Supernalia, the Surfer finally pierced Galactus' barrier with the aid of Reed Richards and escaped Earth. But he discovered Zenn-La had been devastated by a vengeful Galactus, barely capable of supporting life. Worse yet, Shalla-Bal had been abducted back to Earth by Mephisto. Though it meant trapping himself on Earth again (since Reed's escape method would work only once), the Surfer returned to Earth and defeated Mephisto, who sent Shalla-Bal back to Zenn-La, though not before the Surfer endowed her with a portion of his cosmic power which she used to revitalize their ravaged homeworld.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDefenders No More\n\nThe Surfer helped the Defenders liberate the Squadron Supreme’s alternate Earth (Earth-S, Earth-712) from the control of the demonic Null The Living Darkness, then celebrated the Hulk's brief public acceptance after gaining Bruce Banner's intellect. But the Surfer and his fellow senior Defenders - Hulk, Namor and Strange - were tricked into disbanding after the alien Tribunal convinced them their continued teamwork was fated to cause Earth's doom. The Surfer, meanwhile, helped the Fantastic Four defeat the cosmic-powered Tyros (formerly Galactus' herald Terrax) and locate a missing Reed Richards, helped Earth's heroes neutralize the threat of the near-omnipotent Beyonder, and teamed with the Molecule Man to undo much of the damage done to Earth by the Beyonder.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe Spaceways Reopened\n\nPiercing Galactus' barrier again (this time by using the Thing's simple suggestion of trying to pass through it without his surfboard), the Surfer made peace with Galactus by rescuing his current herald Nova (Frankie Raye) from the Skrulls, after which Galactus finally ended the Surfer's long exile. Radd revisited his homeworld, but Shalla-Bal had become empress of the rejuvenated Zenn-La and was not free to renew their romance. The Surfer became embroiled in fresh hostilities between the interstellar Kree and Skrull empires, and intervened in a series of plots by the Elders of the Universe, who planned to destroy Galactus, and the universe with him-in order to become the supreme powers of a new universe. The Surfer thwarted the Elders with the aid of his new love interest Mantis, the Earth-born cosmic heroine also known as the Celestial Madonna, but she seemingly died in the process; though she would later return, she never fully renewed her romance with the Surfer. Romantic sparks developed between Nova and the Surfer, whose influence gradually led Nova to question the morality of her role as a herald. Galactus finally replaced her with the far more ruthless Morg, who killed Nova during a conflict with the Surfer and most of the other ex-heralds.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCosmic Adventures and Mysteries Galore\n\nThe Surfer has repeatedly battled space-born menaces such as Reptyl, Ego the Living Planet, Super-Skrull, Midnight Sun, Nebula, Galactus' dark counterpart Tyrant-and, perhaps most notably, Thanos, a death-worshipping rogue Eternal who wiped out half the life in the universe using the omnipotent Infinity Gauntlet before the Surfer teamed with a reborn Adam Warlock and many other heroes to seize and dismantle the gauntlet after undoing its effects. Later the Surfer foiled the mission of the galactic mercenary White Raven, to obtain an unknown power source for Thanos. The Surfer has been allied with cosmic adventurers such as Jack of Hearts, Ganymede, Genis-Vell and Warlock’s Infinity Watch, who helped the Surfer restore Shalla-Bal to life after she sacrificed herself to save Zenn-La from the supremely powerful Great One. The Surfer also partnered with Quasar, Beta Ray Bill, Morfex, and Xenith to form the short-lived Star Masters team, and began participating in occasional Defenders reunions - the Tribunal's hoax having since been exposed. During his travels, the Surfer also met his long-lost brother Fennan. However, Zenn-La and its people later seemingly vanished, and the Surfer was led to believe that his homeworld had been destroyed long ago by the mysterious Other, and that the Zenn-Lavian world and people he had encountered since becoming the Surfer were mere illusions. While this seems highly unlikely, Zenn-La's bizarre disappearance remains unexplained.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDeath of Galactus/Rebirth of the Defenders\n\nLosing his capacity for emotion again, the Surfer returned to Earth, eventually regaining his personality during a time travel adventure and sharing a romance with Alicia Masters. They ultimately parted as friends after many adventures together, one of which pitted them against Galactus' new herald Red Shift and led to the temporary destruction of Galactus himself. When a Gaea-powered curse from a dying Yandroth mystically forced Surfer, Namor, Hulk and Strange to assemble in response to any and all threats to the Earth, the ongoing stress of this situation coupled with the subtle emotional influence of the curse itself gradually drove the four senior Defenders mad, and they attempted to rule the world as the Order in the belief that this was the most efficient way to protect the planet. Their fellow Defenders - Hellcat, Nighthawk, Valkyrie, and Clea - teamed with other heroes-including Ardina, a cosmic-powered woman whom they mystically created from a portion of the Surfer's own energy-to oppose the Order and return them to their senses, just in time to prevent the curse from rendering a resurrected Yandroth all-powerful.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMarduk Redux\n\nMore recently, fearing a prophesied apocalypse, the Surfer worked with the alien Annunaki race to gather and protect some of Earth's most extraordinarily gifted children. In the end, one of those children, Ellie Waters, saved Earth from the godlike Marduk entity, preventing the apocalypse and reordering reality as if the Marduk crisis had never happened; though Ellie apparently retains her memories of these events. The Surfer has resumed his interstellar wanderings, but remains ready to aid his adopted homeworld should Earth ever need him.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGladiators, Slugs, and Old Friends\n\nDuring his travels, Surfer was captured by the Planet Sakaar Empire and planted with an obedience disk to ensure he remained loyal to them. Fighting as a gladiator, the Surfer was finally forced to face the Hulk. The Hulk had viewed Surfer as a friend, and was enraged when the Surfer mercilessly attacked. Destroying the obedience disk, the Hulk nearly killed the Surfer before being forced to stop. The Hulk and several other slaves and gladiators were freed when the Surfer used the Power Cosmic to remove their own obedience slugs and give them a way out of the arena.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnnihilation\n\nThe Silver Surfer had next joined other former heralds of Galactus to save their former master when the Annihilation Wave lead by Annihilus brought reigning catastrophe to the Kree Empire. Galactus had been imprisoned by Thanos and the Surfer along with former other heralds Red Shift; Firelord, and current herald Stardust attempt to free their master. The plan is a success, but in the process Stardust and Red Shift are presumably killed. Then when Stardust is revealed to be alive, it and the Silver Surfer both agree to become Galactus' heralds together. Later the Surfer tracks down Proemial Gods, Aegis and Tenebrous, which led him to almost being killed when he is thrown into the energy form that is known as the Crunch. Though he then channels that energy into his own being and uses this new-found power to kill the two powerful god like beings.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNova\n\nThe Silver Surfer is next seen bringing Galactus to a planet known as Orbucen so he may consume the planets energy. During this attack they encounter Nova (Richard Rider). Nova tries to convince the Surfer to stop the attack, but the Surfer seems devoid of all emotion he once had for living things, informing Nova that it must be this way for Galactus to survive. Nova tries to subdue Galactus but is stopped every time by the Surfer. He convinces the Surfer to at least give the inhabitants enough time to get their ships off the planet. The Silver Surfer allows it, channeling the power cosmic with a blink to allow them immediate take-off. While on Orbucen, the two also encounter a psi-creature known as Harrow, who has taken hidden refuge on Galactus' ship. When Nova awakes Harrow from hibernation the Surfer breaks the creature’s psilink that has kept him hidden all this time, and Galactus proceeds to incinerate the creature. Galactus then transported Nova five light years away from him, and the Silver Surfer warned the Centurion that he dare not let their paths cross again, telling him that \"Galactus never spares anything twice\" before flying off.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nReturn to Sakaar/Return of the Silver Savage\n\nThe Planet of Sakaar ravaged by famine and brutality, many inhabitants looked to the story of t he Sakaarson for hope, and protection. The Silver Surfer arrived and was mistaken for the Saakarson by an old statue which was to represent their great hero. In reality the Surfer only appeared so that his master Galactus could feed. He meets and warns Skaar son of the Hulk of what is to come, but Skaar doesn't believe him and the two begin to fight. The Silver Surfer tells him that Sakaar has the energy in it from the old power, and that it is enough to sate Galactus for a hundred thousand years. When the Surfer tries to call Galactus to the planet Skaar traps the Surfer with an obedience disk. The Surfer then shows Skaar what it means to be a herald of the mighty Galactus as Galalctus feeds on Sakaar. It is revealed that what the Surfer shown Skaar was a vision of what would happen thanks to Skaar's misguidance towards his people. Skaar fought the Surfer once again, and was banished to Earth. Galactus after being awakened from his slumber caused by the sated energy of the old power, he hungered for more. The Silver Surfer tried to stop him, but was sent away across the universe by Galactus, who was no longer in need of the Surfer as a herald. The Surfer told his tale to others who wield the old power and warned them that someday soon, Galactus would come for them too.\n\n&nbsp;",

She can expand into an energy field several yards wide and alter her humanoid appearance at least to the extent of reshaping her facial features.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHistory:\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Multiverse, the silent being later called Singularity fell from the sky to Doctor Victor von Doom’s reality mosaic Battleworld, landing on the island-domain of Arcadia, her body apparently composed of space itself. Found by sorceress Nico Minoru, the two quickly became friends. The child-like girl enjoyed having a ribbon tied in her hair and was fascinated by Minoru’s cat, whose collar she wore as a bracelet.\n\nNico’s A-Force teammates suspected the girl was somehow connected to recent unexplained portal activity, which later allowed a robot Sentinel to attack Arcadia; the girl assisted A-Force in fighting it. When the Thor Corps police force later came to arrest She-Hulk (Jen Walters) for crossing domain borders, the girl hid A-Force within herself. She used her first word (“hide”) as she did, then began regularly speaking in one-word increments.\n\nLearning the portals were Asgardian, She- Hulk determined the goddess Loki had created them as part of an elaborate challenge for rule of Arcadia.

      "biography": "A bioengineer for Oscorp's New Orleans subsidiary, Nathaniel Essex developed techniques to create a super-soldier who could evade any form of detection and hypnotically persuade others. When his supervisors refused to allow him to test his procedures on human subjects, Essex experimented upon himself. Much like Oscorp's self-mutated president Norman Osborn, Essex developed superhuman abilities accompanied by schizophrenic traits. One of these voices identified itself as Lord Apocalypse, a powerful mutant who intended to usher in \"the Final Age\" of humanity and, presumably, bring about either mutant rule or the end of the world entirely. It is unclear if Lord Apocalypse was real or hallucinatory, but regardless, Essex was fired from Oscorp for his interaction with his hallucinatory voices.Calling himself \"Sinister\" and elaborately tattooed to that effect, Essex relocated to New York, following \"Lord Apocalypse's\" instructions to slay ten \"innocent\" mutants, after which Lord Apocalypse would help complete Essex's transformation. Essex murdered four mutant youths but a fifth victim, Jean-Paul Beaubier, survived thanks to his superhuman speed. Under Marvel Girl's telepathic counsel, Beaubier provided the X-Men with information about Sinister. X-Men members Cyclops, Colossus, Storm, Wolverine, Marvel Girl and Nightcrawler dispersed throughout New York in search of Sinister  Having anticipated this response, Sinister snuck into X-Men headquarters, intending to slay the mutants who had remained behind. Sinister threw Professor Xavier down a flight of stairs, then fought Iceman, Angel, Dazzler and Shadowcat to a standstill before Rogue caught him and flew into the air with him. Rogue intended to drop Sinister to his death, but a returning Storm dissuaded her.Taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, Sinister broke down completely, suffering from sensory disorientation. Lord Apocalypse (or the hallucination thereof) appeared before him in his cell, declaring Sinister unworthy of being his Horseman, and then ordered Sinister to choke himself.

      "biography": "In times of pain and loss, in times of deepest sorrow, Sister Maggie remains Daredevil’s confidant and confessor: a light in his soul’s darkest nights, a reflection of his heart’s highest aspirations. She imparts wisdom and reminders of faith when Daredevil needs it most.\n\nTaking the Veil\n\nMargaret Grace Murdock is the former wife of heavyweight prize fighter Jonathan “Battlin’ Jack” Murdock. They have a son and name him Matt, and after his birth Margaret experiences postpartum depression. Her paranoia that Jack was neglecting her for Matt led her to attack him. Scared of herself, she runs away from her family.\n\nTurning to religion and becoming a nun, she found the strength to overcome her past problems and forge a new life dedicated to God and helping others. Re-adopting her first name, she became known as Sister Maggie while working amongst the poor and homeless in several missions across the world. Jack told Matt his mother had died, but Maggie secretly kept an eye on the young Matt, though she did not typically interact with him directly.\n\nCatholic Training\n\nSister Maggie has extensive training in Catholicism. Her strong faith in God gives her the strength to accept difficulties in life and to maintain an optimistic, hopeful attitude. She is highly talented in projecting this information to others, helping them to cope with their problems as well. Maggie is extremely compassionate and has basic medical training (first aid skills).\n\nAntagonists\n\nWhile Maggie believes that God's love embraces even Lucifer, she faces a few enemies such as Quentin Beck as Mysterio who leads a plot to drive Daredevil mad. In the process, he sends Bullseye (Lester) to capture an infant thought to be the Antichrist. Though Bullseye slays several nuns, Maggie is spared and protects the baby's location.\n\nRelatives and Chosen Family\n\nDaredevil (AKA Matt Murdock) is Maggie's biological son with Jack Murdock. She abandons her family but later provides guidance to Matt as Sister Maggie. While it takes her some time to admit to him that she's his mother, Maggie keeps a close watch over him throughout his life.\n\nThe Almighty God is Maggie's guiding light. She turns to him in times of need, especially when her son Matt is in danger of losing his faith or his life. She is a devout Catholic and works alongside her sisters in convents and missions across the world to help the sick and poor.\n\nA Sister's Story\n\nWhen Matt was blinded after a freak accident, Sister Maggie visited him in the hospital, offering him words of comfort that helped him through the trauma, though he had no idea she was his mother at the time. Maggie knew he had gained new senses from the accident and told him that they would eventually prove to be a gift; she made him promise to keep these abilities a secret, even from his father.\n\nYears later, Matt, now the costumed adventurer Daredevil, suffered a vicious beating at the hands of the Kingpin, and a stabbing by petty criminal Turk Barrett. Matt stumbled upon Fogwell’s Gym, where his father trained, and Sister Maggie found him there. Taking him to her church, she helped him recover, providing both medical care and prayer. Murdock recognized her cross and knew she was the same woman who had visited him after the accident. He also suspected she was his mother. When he asked her, she denied this, but he heard her heart skip a beat and knew she was lying.\n\nOver the years, Sister Maggie has provided both physical and spiritual aid to Matt, both as Daredevil and in his civilian identity. After Daredevil was exhausted from a series of emotional and corporal assaults led by Typhoid Mary, Maggie encouraged him to seek confession.\n\nWhen Matt was exposed as Daredevil and sought a new identity, Maggie suggested the name Jack, leading him to become “Jack Batlin” for a time. When Matt regained long-suppressed memories, Maggie helped him cope with the realization that he had seemingly killed a woman when he had first sought information on his father’s killers years before.\n\nAfter asking Matt to represent Ryker’s island inmate Louis Bastuto, Maggie later counseled Matt during the investigation of the Triple Threat Killer and during Mysterio (Quentin Beck)’s plot to drive the hero mad. During the latter encounter, she finally admitted to Matt that she was his mother, though she refused to discuss the life she had so long ago put behind her.\n\nMaggie protected a young baby girl that Mysterio had sent the assassin Bullseye (Lester) to abduct. At the Clinton Mission Shelter, Maggie was badly injured by Bullseye, and several other nuns were killed or tortured by him. But she refused to give up the infant. Matt’s lover Karen Page tried to trick Bullseye with a doll while Maggie fled with the baby, but Bullseye discovered the truth and claimed the real infant. Karen distracted Bullseye from attacking Maggie, but he then killed Karen instead with Daredevil's club. After Daredevil saved the baby, he and Maggie named it Karen, and Maggie attended Karen Page’s funeral.",

He trapped her in his mystic bindings and she became his ward.  During this captivity, Nil began to seek and learn about humanity.  In that time, she escorted Michael Morbius, Blade, and Vengeance to her master and began to feel love for Strange.

      "biography": "Born in fire. Raised by monsters. Destined to destroy. He is the son of Hulk, Skaar. Abandoned on a Savage Planet \nThe catastrophe on Sakaar which caused the death of Caiera and the Hulk to seek revenge on those he held responsible gave birth to a new kind of monster. A lone child emerged from the charred waste the planet was left in. He grew quickly, and without parents to raise him so did his rage. Taken in by savage creatures, the child learned at a young age to kill in order to survive. Soon, he was given a name – Skaar – and his story was just beginning. Skaar was proclaimed a prophet by some and a demon by others, but all he cared about was claiming his birthright – the Old Power. There were those who would oppose him, but after suffering so many hardships since birth, Skaar only knew how to endure. Return of the Silver Savage \nThe Silver Surfer was trapped on Sakaar at one time and forced to fight in the arena of the Red King. After he was freed by Hulk, he was able to return to his master's side. It is unrevealed if his master sought retaliation for imprisoning his herald, but Galactus was going to devour the planet. Hoping to warn the population - giving them enough time to evacuate - the Silver Surfer returned and was met with violence. Skaar viciously attacked the Surfer and managed to enslave him again with an Obedience Disk. Hell-bent on destroying Axeman Bone and his army, Skaar persisted in fighting a war that only delayed his people from escaping Sakaar's imminent destruction. Caiera's spirit tried to reason with her son after she took the Old Power from him. Skaar said he only wanted to cleanse the planet of those he believed were evil, but a vision shown to him by the Surfer illustrated how everyone on Sakaar would die once Galactus arrived. Skaar tricked his mother into thinking he saw the error of his ways, but once she restored his power, Skaar doomed his people by destroying their means of escape. Caiera was left with no choice but to banish him to Earth. Before he was completely sucked through the wormhole, Skaar watched as his mother sacrificed herself to Galactus hoping to sate his hunger with an enormous amount of Old Power. The Silver Surfer said her final act would save billions since the Old Power could sustain his master for years to come. Skaar chose to defile Caiera's memory and awakened Galactus' need to feed once more with a blast of his Old Power, and then he was gone. Daddy Issues \nOn Earth, Skaar didn't find peace as an encounter with the Fantastic Four, She-Hulk and H.A.M. M.E.R. forced Norman Osborn to bomb the battlefield, seemingly killing him in the process. Skaar didn't die that day, but he learned he could transform into a young boy. His inner child despised everything Skaar stood for, but Skaar only had one thing on his mind – to find the Hulk and kill him for abandoning him on Sakaar. He blamed his father for every horrible thing he had to bear on his home world, and he would have the chance to pay him back when the Hulk finally arrived. Banner suppressed the personality known as the Green Scar, leaving the \"Savage Hulk\" in his place, but this incarnation was still more than a match for Skaar. While Hulk had no memory of his son, this didn't stop the raging titans from nearly causing a nuclear catastrophe during their brawl. After Hulk and the Warbound averted disaster, Skaar deemed Hulk wasn't worthy enough to kill and left. Training Days \nSkaar allied with Banner, now freed of his Hulk persona courtesy of the Red Hulk. Banner wanted to train his son should the Green Scar return and decided Skaar needed to learn all the things his savage childhood denied him; aspects like teamwork, developing friendships and resisting temptation. Skaar's training resulted in several pairings with deadly sparring partners. His first battle pit Skaar against Cain Marko, the powerhouse known as Juggernaut. The conflict ended badly for Marko as Skaar used a combination of strength and Old Power to punch him into orbit. Next on Banner's list of playmates was Daken. This meeting almost led to disaster when Skaar transformed back into a child and asked Daken to kill him, forcing Banner and Wolverine to save him. A friendly game of football with A-Bomb and Korg nearly turned deadly when the Harpy attacked. Fearing his wife, Betty, had become the creature once more, Banner saved her from Skaar's blade. When it was revealed to be Marlo, A-Bomb took her away. Finally, Skaar's last lesson would be taught while fighting one of Hulk's oldest foes, Tyrannus. Skaar was tempted to join Tyrannus and his horde of monsters, but he chose to drive the villain back to his underground lair instead. Skaar received a hero's parade for saving the city.  Fall of the Hulks \n When a collection of the smartest criminal minds on the planet came together in a group called the Intelligencia, Banner became their prime target. In their pursuit to destroy the Hulk they besieged several others to help further that goal. One of the Intelligencia's first acquisitions was a man who betrayed them in the past, Doctor Doom. They used the Cosmic Hulk to invade Latveria and abduct the mad dictator. Skaar attempted to thwart the Intelligencia's plans, but Cosmic Hulk was too powerful, and Skaar had to be saved by Banner. Doom was taken, but Skaar got a second chance to prevent a kidnapping when the Red She-Hulk assaulted the Avengers. More brutal than anticipated, Red She-Hulk beat her opponents and took Henry Pym. The only chance they had left was to take the fight to the Intelligencia where Skaar met his half-sister, Lyra, and several other heroes who allied with Banner against them. However, once Banner was captured by his enemies, Skaar was forcibly ejected from the Hellcarrier and temporarily on his own.  World War Hulks \n Skaar did what he knew best – fight. He fought against the Intelligencia's army of Hulks marching on the nation's capitol. He fought against some of the \"Hulked-Out Heroes\" running amok. He found a way back to the Hellcarrier and saved Banner from death at the hands of the Red She-Hulk – nearly killing her in the process by running her through with his sword. From the moment Skaar arrived on the planet he had been fighting and waiting for the opportunity to kill the Hulk, and even though he walked away from it the first time they met, he would get another chance. In order to free those transformed into Hulks, Banner drew all the radiation back inside his body, becoming the Hulk once more. Father and son would again meet on the field of battle, and Skaar was ready for a rematch. The son of Hulk was first to attack with the intent to kill, and try as he might Hulk appeared to be taking the worst of the blows between Skaar's strength and his deadly Old Power. Betty came to the aid of her ex-husband, but even the power of the Red She-Hulk could not slow Skaar's onslaught. In an attempt to get rid of her, Skaar lashed out and inadvertently placed several onlookers in jeopardy. When the Hulk set aside their differences to save innocent lives, Skaar finally realized his father was not a monster as Banner said. Skaar decided not to fight any longer and shifted back into a child. Banner saw a little something of him inside the boy and chose to embrace him and make sure his son knew he would be there for him - always.  Sibling Rivalry \n Skaar watched as his new family adjusted to one another when a sudden, horrific sensation shot through him. Hiro-Kala, the twin brother he never met, was using the Old Power to propel the planet K'ai toward the Earth in an attempt to destroy the father who abandoned him on Sakaar. Both siblings shared a similar story save for the fact that Skaar changed his opinion of the Hulk, and he knew Hiro-Kala was evil and unable to see the light. Skaar also knew his father was unprepared to do what was necessary to save the world – kill Hiro-Kala. Skaar used his Old Power to operate one of the stone ships of the Shadow People to take the Hulks into space, and once on K'ai Skaar wanted to confront his brother despite the protests of the Hulk. Korg and A-Bomb were assigned to watch Skaar, but he eventually gave them the slip and met Hiro-Kala face-to-face. While Banner helped the planet heal itself, Skaar imprisoned Hiro-Kala in a rock tomb essentially making him a part of K'ai and ending the threat to Earth. The Hulks went home, and K'ai was brought back to the Microverse by Arcturus Rann and the Enigma Force.",

      "biography": "Long a victim of child abuse, Sally Blevins finally escaped her abusive stepfather when her mutant power first manifested itself and he threw her out of the house. She ended up a runaway, living on the streets until she joined the Morlocks, a group of homeless mutants. At one point, Skids encountered Rusty Collins, who was being pursued by the Freedom Force (government-chartered mutant enforcers composed of former members of the Brotherhood of Mutants) and a mob of mutant-hating humans. Rusty had accidentally injured a woman with his pyrokinetic powers and was wanted by the U.S Government. Skids’ force field allowed the two to easily escape, but they were eventually overtaken by the Freedom Force on the edge of Central Park.Before the evil mutants could take them in, a mob of humans attacked the Freedom Force. In the confusion, Skids and Rusty escaped. She tried to get him to the safety of the Morlocks, but the Freedom Force caught up with them again, this time in the sewers beneath New York. Fortunately, the young mutants were saved by the timely arrival of the original X-Factor. After a brief skirmish, Freedom Force retreated.Skids and Rusty began to learn more about their powers with X-Factor’s mentorship, becoming the first of several X-Factor “trainees” as well as developing a romantic relationship. They shared other adventures alongside the rest of the trainees, at one point calling themselves the X-Terminators. In this capacity, the team helped stop a demonic invasion of New York.Eventually, X-Factor was disbanded and most of their trainees were inducted into the membership of the New Mutants. Rusty and Skids, however, learned instead that Freedom Force were taking mutant infants that were abducting during the demonic invasion into government custody. They tried to save the children but were imprisoned. The other New Mutants were unable to rescue their friends due to their concurrent adventures.Rusty was able to break himself and Skids out of prison, in order to prevent the Vulture from releasing another villain, Nitro, from captivity. The couple were returned to custody, however.A mutant terrorist group, the Mutant Liberation Front, took notice of Rusty and Skids and freed them. In the process, they had a brief run-in with the Cable, who was also trying to rescue the couple at the same time. For reasons of their own, the couple voluntarily joined the Front and served with them for a brief time.Rusty and Skids were kidnapped, however, by the Acolytes of Magneto when that team of self-styled mutant saviors attacked and decimated the ranks of the Front. The Acolytes took the couple to the orbiting space-station Avalon and inducted them into their group. Later, however, Holocaust attacked the Acolytes and destroyed their space station headquarters. Rusty Collins was killed and Skids was injured. Holocaust was stopped by the X-Men, and Skids was taken to the X-Men's mansion for medical attention. Upon recuperation, she left the mansion without being noticed.Skids became a college student in Boulder, Colorado, studying biological sciences. She was eventually contacted by her friends of the New Mutants who had long since become X-Force, but they were soon all attacked by Reignfire and his incarnation of the Mutant Liberation Front. During the adventure, Skids’ force field disrupted the teleportation abilities of Locus, causing both of them to be caught in a trans-spatial backlash which deposited them in the Balkan country of Latveria. Skids and Locus were then captured by an age-old sorceress named Pandemonia, the self-styled Queen of Chaos, who sought to recruit mutants into her own personal army. With the assistance of the young sorceress Jennifer Kale, X-Force managed to defeat Pandemonia and rescue their friends, whereupon Skids returned to university life.For a brief time, Skids was a member of the Los Angeles branch of the X-Corporation, and she was on hand to aid the X-Men against the threat of Elias Bogan. Following the events of House of M|M-Day, Skids was one of the many mutants who fled to the Xavier Institute and made a home in the refugee camp there. Recently Skids rejoined the Morlocks (secretly working for S.H.I.E.L.D.).",

      "biography": "A scientist at Beemont Manufacturing, Jalome Beacher created a chemical that could be used to coat a surface and thereby eliminate all friction between it and any other object. Unfortunately, his department was closed after a larger corporation bought out Beemont, and Beacher found himself downsized by the new management, Mr. Rockwall. Since his invention was never unveiled, Beacher decided to open his own manufacturing plant based on the non-stick chemical, but he needed funds for a sizable down payment. He used his chemical to create a costumed identity for himself and began robbing banks as Slyde. Not even Spider-Man nor the police could stop him! Perhaps he could even steal from the new management of Beemont, forcing Rockwall out of business? Instead of stealing money, Slyde stumbled upon evidence that proved Rockwall was using the company as a money laundering operation. Slyde blackmailed Rockwall for a sizable amount of money, and the two agreed to meet. On one side, Rockwall stood with his hired goons in ambush. On the other, Slyde had secretly contacted the District Attorney to turn Rockwall in. On yet another side, Spider-Man was on hand, having discovered the plan. In the resulting confusion, Slyde swooped in, taking the ransom money and sliding away, leaving Rockwall, Spider-Man, and the authorities behind. Spider-Man next tangled with Slyde months later in Atlantic City. Slyde was on the trail of money exchanges brokered by financier Carl Jenkins, and he stole a sizable amount. Spider-Man inadvertently encountered him, as he was in the area helping his Aunt May and her friend Nathan Lubensky at the time. He forced Slyde to abandon the money in order to flee.Once, Slyde ran afoul of the Maggia. He learned the hard way not to steal from their associates: the Maggia had his brother Matt kidnapped! Slyde sought help from Luke Cage, Hero for Hire, paying him to help save his brother. The two were also joined by Spider-Man, who happened upon them, and they were successful in rescuing his brother.   Slyde also appeared as a member of the Crimson Cowl's Masters of Evil, in their plot to get rich through a blackmail scheme using global weather control. The team was defeated and apprehended by the Thunderbolts, and Slyde was among those remanded to custody.Spider-Man caught Slyde robbing banks once again, and quickly apprehended the villain. However, even as he was being remanded, Slyde considered this a victory for himself, as he felt he did well for a man of his age, over forty. With Jalome in jail, Matt \"borrowed\" the Slyde costume. The Spot contacted Slyde, and arranged a meeting. However, when the Spot arrived, he found a brainwashed Elektra and ninja of the Hand standing over Matt’s dead body, and he was quickly captured as well. The Spot and Slyde were resurrected by the Hand to join Hydra’s army of superhumans, all orchestrated by the Gorgon. Slyde was among the sixty to seventy agents led by Elektra against S.H.I.E.L.D., but he was felled by S.H.I.E.L.D.’s ally, Wolverine. Jalome was recently seen being recruited by Hammerhead to join a new criminal movement to take down the heroes and usurp the imprisoned Kingpin's criminal empire at the height of Civil War. After refusing to follow Hammerhead's lead and inferring that he would inform the Kingpin of Hammerhead's plans, Slyde was shot and killed by Underworld.",

      "biography": "Conrad Josten was the youngest brother from a large midwestern farming family. His older brother, Erik, ran away from the army to become a soldier-for-hire and, later, a super-villain. His crimes ruined his family as his infamy grew, but Conrad, fueled by pain and guilt, ran away from home. Not much has been revealed about the intervening years, but Conrad was later approached by Henry Peter Gyrich, head of the Commission on Superhuman Activities, who was looking to form an alternative hero team to the Thunderbolts, of which Erik had become a part of as the villain-turned-hero, Atlas. While most of the Redeemers had criminal pasts of their own to atone for, and thus agreed to join the team, it has been suggested that Conrad was approached with the offer that his participation would help the Commission look favorably on his brother Erik’s “criminal” activities. He was outfitted with a special costume to access the Darkforce Dimension, and he took the code-name Smuggler, an alias of Erik’s in his first appearance as a costumed criminal. In fact, Gyrich had launched a plan to eliminate, if not control, the world’s population of superhumans, starting with the Thunderbolts. He remade Nomad into Scourge, charging him with the task to hunt down and eliminate the team, who at this time were scattered and underground. The Thunderbolts eventually defeated Scourge, which led to a confrontation with Gyrich and the Redeemers. Gyrich and the Redeemers were actually being influenced by nanotech, microscopic probes that manipulated Gyrich’s superhuman phobias and allowed him to force the Redeemers to fight. Freed of the nanoprobes with help of the Thunderbolts, Gyrich nevertheless ordered the Thunderbolts to disband, and their role was supplanted by the Redeemers. The Redeemers took the place of the Thunderbolts in their Mt. Charteris headquarters, being trained by  Captain America under the direction of the Commission and S.H.I.E.L.D. Conrad was among the team when they battled Graviton, but Graviton decimated the ranks of the Redeemers. In particular, Smuggler’s powers were turned inward on themselves, and he disappeared, believed to have been killed like his teammates. Instead, Conrad had become trapped in the Darkforce dimension, lost for many weeks. When the Thunderbolts reassembled, Baron Zemo began recruiting his own group of Thunderbolts that would help him battle the original team over the life of Photon, who had the power to inadvertently destroy the world. To this end, he manipulated the comatose body of Blackout, a Darkforce-manipulator, like a puppet on strings. During the battle between the two teams, Zemo revealed Blackout was merely a shell in which he kept the Smuggler trapped. This had the desired effect of turning his brother, Atlas, against his team, and Zemo gained the upper hand. When Zemo was triumphant, he restored Conrad fully to Earth, and he shared a bittersweet reunion with his brother.Conrad remained with the Thunderbolts as the Smuggler, being drawn into their plot against the Grandmaster as well as the  Civil War|Superhuman Registration Act.",

Ultimately both parties were exiled from Earth, and as such the Gods sought to create an agent to prevent the Beasts' return. To that end, Nelvanna, goddess of the Northern Lights, mated with a human. With the midwifery assistance of Sarcee mystic Michael Twoyoungmen, Nelvanna gave birth to a daughter, Narya. Twoyoungmen bound the infant to the lands of Canada, allowing her to assume human form; however, she would weaken if she left Canada's borders.\n\nTwoyoungmen raised the rapidly maturing Narya as his own daughter, and both were soon recruited into Alpha Flight as Shaman and Snowbird. Narya was given the human cover identity of RCMP Records Officer Anne McKenzie, as whom she met and fell in love with fellow officer Doug Thompson. Snowbird and her teammates protected Earth from the Great Beasts, but when Narya married Thompson and became pregnant with his child, the outraged Eskimo Gods banned her from their realm. When Narya went to the Arctic alongside Doug and Shaman to give birth, the necessary magic accidentally revived the evil Pestilence, who had lain dormant underground there. Pestilence possessed Snowbird's newborn son and aged him into an adult, intending to menace Earth with his powers of death and decay. In the ensuing battle, Thompson and the baby were killed by Pestilence, and Vindicator was forced to kill a Pestilence-possessed Snowbird. The souls of Narya, her husband, and their child were then welcomed into the Gods' realm.\n\nSnowbird's spirit occasionally returned to Earth until she was resurrected through a combination of science and magic by the terrorist organization Advanced Idea Mechanics.

      "biography": "POWERS\n\nSpeed can move, think and react at superhuman speeds. His entire body is adapted towards the rigors of high-speed running, including his cardiovascular and respiratory systems. He metabolizes an estimated 95% of caloric energy content of food (normal human use is about 25%). His enhanced musculature makes him virtually tireless due to his metabolism not producing fatigue-building poisons. His body constantly expels waste products during his accelerated respiration through exhalation. His tendons have the tensile strength of spring steel and his bones can withstand high-speed impacts because they are significantly more durable than normal calcium.\n\nSpeed’s practical reaction time is about five times faster than a normal human’s and the speed at which his brain processes information is heightened to a level commensurate with his bodily speed, enabling him to perceive his surroundings while traveling at high velocities. Speed’s body has an invisible aura that prevents his clothing from being affected by air friction as he moves at high speeds.\n\nSpeed can run at supersonic speeds, and is capable of short bursts of speed well beyond supersonic levels. At his average speed, he can run for about four hours until he needs to replenish his energy. He can run up vertical surfaces before gravity overtakes him and run across liquid by moving too fast to break its surface tension. By rapidly vibrating his hands in close proximity, Speed creates hyperkinetic vibrations he can direct at a target, accelerating and destabilizing its atomic matter until it explodes.\n\nORIGIN\n\nYears ago during a battle with the Salem's Seven, the Scarlet Witch (Wanda Maximoff) channeled the chaos magic found within New Salem, inadvertently using fragmented energies of the Hell-lord Mephisto, into herself to conceive twin sons.\n\nBelieving the twins were fragments of his own lost soul, Master Pandemonium abducted the twins resulting in the twins seemingly being reabsorbed into a reconstituted Mephisto; however, the twins’ souls had been so transfigured by the Scarlet Witch’s magic that they temporarily destroyed Mephisto.\n\nBelieved destroyed, the twins’ souls were apparently cast back in time and reborn as individual entities. Thomas ended up in Springfield, New Jersey, while William was adopted by Jeff and Rebecca Kaplan and raised in New York’s Upper West Side by Frank and Mary Shepherd.\n\nOften erupting into violent behavior, Thomas was arrested and placed in the NJ Youth Correctional Facility after “accidentally” vaporizing his school where they attempted to turn him into a weapon. When the Hulkling (Teddy Altman) was abducted by the Super-Skrull (Kl’rt), the Vision used the Avengers’ fail-safe program to locate Thomas to recruit him into the Young Avengers. Upon being rescued, the Young Avengers discovered Thomas and Wiccan (William Kaplan) looked nearly identical and Wiccan later came to believe the two were both sons of the Scarlet Witch. After rescuing Hulkling and narrowly averting a war between the interstellar Skrull and Kree Empires, which both claimed custody over Hulkling, Wiccan and Thomas, now calling himself “Speed,” planned to locate their missing mother; but they were interrupted when the Superhuman Registration Act (SHRA) passed and the Young Avengers were banned as outlaws when they failed to register.\n\nCaptured by a SHIELD Superhuman Restraint Unit, the Young Avengers were soon rescued by Captain America (Steve Rogers) and joined his underground resistance movement, the \"Secret Avengers.\" Afterward,&nbsp;the Young Avengers helped the young Runaways team escape similar arrest by SHIELD and teamed up against Marvel Boy (Noh-Varr), a nanite-controlled agent of the top-secret Cube prison facility. Speed was among the heroes captured by the Cube’s Warden, although he was promptly rescued by the Young Avengers and Runaways who had not been apprehended.\n\nWhen the Skrulls began an invasion of Earth, the Young Avengers joined in stopping their plans of world domina- tion. Afterward, Speed and Wiccan traveled to Genosha, Wundagore Mountain, and Cresskill, New Jersey in search of the Scarlet Witch, whom they believe to be their mother, but found Master Pandemonium, who sought to escape the life of the demonic being he had become, liv- ing in the Cresskill house. Master Pandemonium helped the twins realize they should embrace the present and not the horrid past they once lived . In the aftermath of the Skrull Invasion, the Young Avengers battled the Young Masters – Big Zero (Amity), Enchantress (Sylvie Lushton), Executioner (Danny), Melter (Christopher); Egghead (an android from the Microverse) and Coat of Arms, whom Thomas previously met years ago while in juvenile detention.",

      "biography": "James Saunders, a disgruntled chemist tired of his job with the Hudson Pharmaceutical Company of West Caldwell, New Jersey, was contacted by the Grandmaster and offered superhuman powers in exchange for joining a team that would compete on his behalf. Saunders agreed, and he created a formula based on information given to him by the Grandmaster and that granted him superhuman speed. The Grandmaster then had him take the identity of the Whizzer, join the Squadron Sinister, and fight the Avengers, who themselves were pawns of the Grandmaster’s opponent, Kang The Conqueror.Although the Squadron was defeated, the Grandmaster kept his word and returned Saunders and the others to Earth with their powers. A few months later, Saunders and the other members of the Squadron Sinister were hired by the alien geographer, Nebulon. Nebulon and the Squadron Sinister tried to melt the polar ice caps, but they were stopped by the Defenders. In the end, Doctor Strange cast a spell of amnesia over the Squadron members, causing them to forget their powers.Saunders got his job back at Hudson Pharmaceuticals and worked there for some time until his memory was accidentally restored when the Avengers questioned him about one of the other Squadron members, Doctor Spectrum. Saunders experimented with the original formula that had given him his powers, creating a variant that increased his speed to even greater levels. He took a new name, Speed Demon and began to use his powers in various thefts, most often clashing with Spider-Man.Later, Speed Demon joined the Sinister Syndicate, led by the Beetle (now the hero MACH-IV). During this time, he developed a rivalry with various other members of the team. The team proved short-lived, and Speed Demon rejoined their later incarnation led by  Leila Davis, the wife of the villain the Ringer, which was similarly disbanded shortly after, due as much to the petty in-fighting among its members as their defeat by Spider-Man.Deciding to branch out, Speed Demon would later participate in an event called the Bloodsport, an annual tournament held in Madipoor showcasing fighters from around the globe. During the first round, He was pitted against Wolverine (as Patch) in a Cylinder Match. Despite his best efforts and the addition to throwing knives into his arsenal, Speed Demon did not fair well. While trying to incapacitate Patch in a vortex of wind, Speed Demon was caught in the neck by one of his own throwing knives.  Bleeding profusely, Saunders fell pray to Patch. While the crowd cheered for death, Patch ultimately choose not to kill his wounded opponent. Speed Demon, despite his injuries, survived.Sometime later, He joined the villains-turned-heroes team the Thunderbolts and, with them, fought Fathom's Five, Hydra, the Purple Man, and the Avengers. Always contentious and prone to grandstanding, he seemed to serve faithfully with his teammates. But in fact, Sauders had been committing crimes in his old identity of the Whizzer, funneling it into an account to keep the Thunderbolts operational. He was originally discovered by his teammate, Blizzard, but Speed Demon bullied him into keeping it a secret. This came to a head when Saunders robbed division of Richmond Enterprises, which resulted in his former teammate Nighthawk seeking him out. Before the Thunderbolts could stop Nighthawk, a revived Squadron Sinister also arrived, and they took both Nighthawk and Speed Demon away with them. The Squadron hoped to take over the world in order to better solve the world’s problems, but they were again confronted by the Thunderbolts. Speed Demon hoped to trick the Squadron into thinking he would help them, but he turned on them, helping the Thunderbolts force them to escape. Nevertheless, Songbird ultimately kicked Speed Demon out of the Thunderbolts because of his previous robberies,  claiming that what the Thunderbolts needed more were members whose hearts were behind their efforts to reform.Speed Demon returned to the Squadron Sinister, who preferred to be called Supreme Power, who were again recruited by the Grandmaster. This time, the Grandmaster claimed that the stakes of the game would affect the entire universe, and he hoped to use the Squadron to find the Wellspring of Power, from which he drew upon to grant the Squadron their abilities. (Indeed, Speed Demon’s powers had been noticeably increasing during his time with the Thunderbolts, presumably having something to do with the Wellspring.) The Thunderbolts’ Joystick, investigating the Wellspring on behalf of Baron Zemo, intercepted Speed Demon’s attempts to track the Wellspring, and the two fought. Joystick surprised Speed Demon by suddenly exhibiting superhuman speeds even greater than his own, and she left him defeated, both his legs broken.",

      "biography": "In an alternate timeline, the child of Mary Jane and Peter Parker grew to become \"Mayday\" Parker - a vivacious teenager with a talent for basketball. Her athletic prowess and bubbly personality made her a popular student with a hectic social life. May was unaware of her father's heroic past until her own latent powers revealed themselves at a crucial point in a ballgame. Walking home afterwards, she was menaced by the Green Goblin - Norman Osborn, Jr. - who hungered for revenge on Peter Parker for the long-past battle that killed Norman's grandfather and crippled Spider-Man. Instead, it was Spider-Girl who faced the new Green Goblin, and twin legacies were born anew.\n\nPeter and Mary Jane Parker initially forbade May from adopting her new role, but they soon realized that their protests were in vain, and Peter chose to help teach his daughter the skills she would need to survive. As Spider-Girl, May encountered many new villains and allies in her war against crime. Most importantly, she convinced Norman Jr. to abandon his pointless feud, and they co-founded a loosely banded super-team of \"New Warriors.\"\n\nIn a battle with the super-villain Killerwatt, who controlled electricity, Spider-Girl was severely shocked. This apparently caused her to lose her powers, until, in a battle with the new Spider-Man, she fell into a generator, where she was, again, shocked severely. Her powers returned, along with a few new powers.\n\nSpider-Girl was faced with other specters from her father's past, including the near-invincible Black Tarantula. The Tarantula arrived from South America to select May Parker as the perfect young woman to continue his bloodline. Creating \"Team Spider\" to supposedly assist May in her war on evil, he began a twisted mind-game to win May's heart, all the while seeking to strengthen his grip on New York's criminal infrastructure.\n\nMay has also fought versions of classic Spider-Man villains. She once fought the Savage Six, and has also fought Aftershock (Electro's daughter). She recently teamed up with Felicity Hardy, who has taken on the role of the Scarlet Spider. She also occasionally faces old villains from Spider-Man's past. She has faced Kaine, Venom, the Kingpin, the Hobgoblin, and Doctor Octopus, to name a few.\n\nRecently, May experienced some of Kaine's power and they both saw a vision of her being stabbed to death in her red and blue costume. She started wearing her black costume to try to trick fate, but she was nevertheless stabbed by a Scrier in a battle. Near death, Normie gave her his symbiote (as a farewell gift, the symbiote healed Normie's scars and tattoos) and the symbiote healed May. In order to save May from the Hobgoblin, the symbiote (who turned out to be a she) drove the Hobgoblin away, but in the process was killed by his sonic emitter. Hobgoblin later escaped.\n\nWhether facing old Spider-Man villains, newer versions of classic bad-guys, or completely new villains, Spider-Girl will always uphold her father's motto: With great power, there must always come great responsibility.",

      "biography": "Peter Parker was orphaned at the age of six and left in the care of his elderly uncle and aunt, Ben and May Parker. Peter was academically gifted, displaying an uncanny affinity for science that was nothing short of genius. As a student at Midtown High School, Peter attended a public evening exhibition where a spider, accidentally irradiated by a particle beam, fell onto Peter's hand and bit him. Peter left the exhibition in a daze and walked into the path of an oncoming car. Without thinking, Peter jumped onto the side of a wall to which he stuck with his bare hands. Stunned, he realized he had acquired superhuman powers similar to those of a spider: enhanced strength and agility, and the ability to cling to almost any surface. To test his new powers, Peter donned a mask and took part in an all-comers wrestling match against Crusher Hogan, winning with ease. Spotted by a talent scout who promised to arrange a TV appearance, Peter hurried home and created a more elaborate costume. Thus Spider-Man was born. With his new powers and sudden fame, Peter promised himself he would take care of Uncle Ben and Aunt May. Following his first appearance on television Peter ended up making the decision that would change his life. Peter tackled a burglar escaping past him, saving the owner of the wrestling arena thousands of dollars. The wrestling arena owner thanked Peter by promising Spider-Man a prominent role in his brand new wrestling league. The wrestling league was a huge success and Spider-Man became its star. As the money rolled in, he decided to reveal to his aunt and uncle the powers he had acquired from the spider bite. Initially, his aunt was frightened by these powers, but Uncle Ben was ecstatic. He was happy for his nephew and could see these amazing powers gave Peter a self-confidence and a belief in himself he did not have before. At this time the Mutant-Human War went into full swing. Peter, as the mysterious Spider-Man, was accused of being a mutant by the local press. Peter wanted to deny it, but Uncle Ben advised him to stay quiet. Ben could see that Peter was the idol of mutants everywhere. Finally, one of them was not afraid to be seen in public. Ben believed if Peter could give hope to those children who were born different than normal humans, then he should. Uncle Ben's wisdom paid off in the end when the Mutant-Human War ended with mutants victorious. The most public and popular of mutants, Peter revealed his true identity and became an international superstar as a wrestler and an actor. He even starred in a movie with his high school human friend Mary Jane Watson, a controversial move since normal humans rarely scored major lead actor roles. The movie ended up launching Mary Jane's career and established Peter as a \"can't miss\" star.Shortly thereafter, Peter took a break from public life. He married his high school sweetheart, Gwen Stacy, and the two of them attended college together, earning doctorates. Peter returned to public life and he and his Uncle Ben set up Spider-Man, Inc., spreading out into many areas including science and charity work.Today, surrounded by his family, including his young son Richard, and close friends, Peter Parker is the envy of the world and its most popular mutant; but lately, Peter has felt like something is wrong in his world. And he has begun to worry about his secret. What would happen if the world discovered he was not truly a mutant?They did find out, when J. Jonah Jameson discovered a journal of his. In the journal was not only the truth about his not being a mutant, but also the fact that he knew that this was not the way things were supposed to be, that he knew Gwen, Uncle Ben, and Gwen's father should be dead. It was discovered that the green goblin had lead J. Jameson to the book.This changed everything for the human race. Peter's bodyguard, Rhino, attacked and nearly beat to death the real green goblin, a close friend of Peter. The world turned on Peter, even when he tried to help. A boy was nearly beaten to death just for wearing a Spider-man shirt. Eventually, it was discovered that it was Peter himself who gave JJ the book in the Green Goblin outfit.When Gwen and the rest of the family got hold of the book, they thought that he had just made it all up, and that he was insane. Finally, in the end, Peter and his family moved to the countryside, to live a peaceful life.",

      "biography": "Peter Parker was the son of scientist Richard Parker and his wife Mary. While Richard worked alongside Ed Brock on medical research, their two families grew close; though several years older, Eddie Brock Jr. was close friends with Peter. Tragedy struck when both sets of parents were killed in a plane crash; Peter was taken in by his Uncle Ben and Aunt May, and lost touch with Eddie. Inheriting his father’s intellect, Peter grew to be a quiet, bookish, boy. His best friends at Midtown High, his school in Queens, were Harry Osborn, son of industrialist Norman Osborn; and Mary Jane Watson, a fellow brain who lived across the street. Peter’s relatively normal life changed abruptly during a school trip to Osborn Industries, Inc. The company had been working on a super soldier serum, the Oz Compound; a spider exposed to it escaped and bit Peter before it was destroyed. Peter soon discovered that he had been mutated, gaining superhuman strength and agility and various spider-like powers. After Peter accidentally broke jock Flash Thompson’s hand in a fight, the Parkers were hit with expensive medical bills; to help pay them, Peter secretly took up a wrestling challenge, wearing a mask to hide his youth and identity. The fight promoter gave him a more colorful costume and dubbed him Spider-Man, but his new career was cut short when he was accused of stealing money. Peter allowed a robber he encountered on the way home to escape because of his bad mood, an action that would later haunt him. He subsequently argued with his uncle over his slipping grades and recent poor attitude, and ran off to cool down; but when he returned home, he learned that a burglar had slain Uncle Ben in his absence. Overhearing some cops mention a cornered criminal who might be the burglar, Peter donned his costume and raced to capture him, only to find it was the same criminal he had allowed to escape earlier. Guilt ridden, Peter finally accepted the great responsibility which came with his powers, becoming a crime fighter as Spider-Man. Norman Osborn transformed into a monstrous, Green Goblin-like menace after mainlining the Oz Compound and attacked Peter’s school, battling Spider-Man until he was shot down by police marksmen and presumed dead; Harry vanished into police custody for protection and questioning. Spider-Man encountered the criminal Shocker, the mutant Wolverine (on the run from Weapon X) and the rampaging Hulk. To help his aunt pay the bills, Peter tried to sell photos of Spider-Man to the Daily Bugle, and ended up hired to maintain the newspaper’s website. Learning that Uncle Ben’s killer worked for Wilson Fisk, the Kingpin of Crime, Peter set out to bring him down. After trying to get information from the Enforcers, he learned the Kingpin’s whereabouts from ambitious underboss Mr. Big. Breaking into the Kingpin’s office while Fisk hosted a party elsewhere in Fisk Tower, Spider-Man was spotted on the security cameras, defeated by Fisk’s superpowered henchman Electro, unmasked, and thrown out a window. Kingpin figured out who had provided his intruder’s information, and personally murdered Mr. Big before having the  body dumped in the river wearing Spider-Man’s mask. Peter inquired about the security cameras in the Internet and sent them a letter going by the name Arthur Simek. He then learned that the security cameras record everything on CDs and that they were stored in an armored cabinet. Peter returned to Fisk’s building, and after defeating Electro, the Enforcers and Fisk in the building's basement, sent the Daily Bugle security footage he had stolen showing the murder of Mr. Big; Fisk swiftly went into hiding. Peter soon revealed his dual identity to Mary Jane, and they began dating. He fought alongside Iron Man at the U.N.; ran into Daredevil in Hell’s Kitchen and helped apprehend the Punisher, a killer vigilante; encountered a lizard creature and a monster composed of swamp vegetation (both transformed scientists) in the sewers; and was mesmerized by Xandu into attacking the sorcerer Dr. Strange. He encountered the former Russian spy, the Black Widow, who stole his webshooters; met the martial artist Shang-Chi; ran into a vampire and unidentified vampire slayer; and prevented a murder by the assassin Elektra. A new girl, Gwen Stacy, whose policeman father had investigated Uncle Ben’s killing, joined Peter’s school; soon after, Peter went to the mall with his friends, where they bumped into the off-duty X-Men after Wolverine recognized Peter. Parker next faced the twin threats of Otto Octavius, alias Doctor Octopus (A.K.A Doc Ock), an Osborn scientist who had gained powers at the same time as Osborn himself; and Kraven, a reality TV show hunter who announced his intention to hunt and kill Spider-Man. After losing his first fight with Octopus, Spider-Man soundly defeated both him and Kraven outside an illegal genetic research lab, in front of a horde of assembled press. The televised fight and a quick interview afterwards helped turn around negative public opinion about Spider-Man; minutes later, he fought one of the lab’s rogue creations, the Sandman. The next day at school, Harry returned—but Peter’s joy evaporated when Norman resurfaced, too. The senior Osborn offered Peter a stark choice: work for him or see his loved ones killed by the goblin. The following day, Peter learned from General Nick Fury that S.H.I.E.L.D. was monitoring him, and was aware of the Osborn situation, but could not intervene unless the goblin made a public move. Spider-Man confronted Osborn to say he would not be intimidated, unaware that Harry had invited Mary Jane over; the goblin seized her and carried her to the Queensboro Bridge, then dropped her off it, and Spider-Man only narrowly managed to catch her. Facing both Spidey and S.H.I.E.L.D. attack helicopters, Osborn fled back home and overdosed on the serum, mutating further. Peter pursued but was nearly killed before Harry walked in on the fight and saved him by driving a spike into the goblin’s back. The pursuing helicopters shot the goblin, who turned back to Osborn and was taken into custody. In the aftermath, Nick Fury told Peter that when he turned 18 and was an adult, he would be forced to work for S.H.I.E.L.D.. Peter’s friendship with Gwen Stacy grew as she began to confide in him regarding family troubles, though this meant he arrived minutes too late to assist Iron Man in capturing the rampaging Rhino. When an imposter dressed as Spider-Man committed a string of robberies, the real Spider-Man was shot in the shoulder by police trying to apprehend him, and Fury sent the Wasp over to Peter’s school to patch him up. While this was happening, the fake Spider-Man killed Captain John Stacy, Gwen’s father. Enraged, Spider-Man foiled the imposter’s latest bank robbery, beat him to a pulp but stopped when he realized he almost killed the guy and left him for the police, clearing his name. As her mother had run off with another man, Gwen moved in with the Parkers; Mary Jane, meanwhile, broke up with Peter, fearful he would one day be killed. Finding boxes full of mementos of his parents in the basement prompted Peter to track down Eddie Brock. Now a university student, Eddie was trying to complete their parents’ Venom Project, a protoplasmic medical dip nicknamed “the Suit” which could enhance its wearer’s abilities while healing illness and injury – even curing cancer; however some of Eddie’s comments led Peter to wonder if their parents had been murdered by their corporate employers. As Spider-Man, he broke into Eddie’s lab to examine the dip, but it enveloped his body, creating a new black costume. He briefly enjoyed this new look, easily stopping a kidnapping and beating an upgraded Shocker; however, after the Suit took control of Peter and nearly killed a mugger, Peter had to electrocute himself to remove it. Seeing the danger of the dip, Peter went back to the lab to destroy the rest of it, confiding in Eddie that he was Spider-Man and apparently convincing Eddie to let him destroy the dip, unaware Eddie had more hidden away. Exposing himself to the Suit, Eddie became an insane, monstrous menace and attacked Peter. In the end, an accidental electrocution seemingly killed Eddie, though the subsequent disappearance of his belongings suggested Brock may have survived. After confronting Nick Fury to ask if his parents had been murdered, Peter returned to the lab, where he found the rest of the dip gone and encountered Eddie’s professor, Curt Conners, the former lizard-man, who deduced Peter was Spider-Man.Shortly thereafter, Peter got back together with Mary Jane; offered guidance to unstable Latverian mutant teen Geldoff alongside the X-Men; and stopped martial artist Danny Rand from using his “Iron Fist” on an aggressive man during a street fight. Wounded X-Man Wolverine later sought refuge in Peter’s home while fleeing remnants of Weapon X. They were also joined by Daredevil who helped them only because innocent people are getting hurt. Also a brief appearance by Black Widow. The Enforcers returned, as did their boss, the Kingpin, who had gone free after the murder evidence against him was ruled inadmissible. Sam Bullit ran for D.A. on an anti-Spider-Man platform, supported by Jameson and the Bugle, and when Peter spoke out against the Bugle’s anti-Spidey stance, he was fired; however, reporter Ben Urich learned that Bullit was tied to the Kingpin, and the Bugle withdrew its support. The Enforcers tried to intimidate Jameson into reversing this, but Spider-Man intervened. Soon after, Jameson admitted his mistake to Peter and reinstated him. Spider-Man next encountered the burglar known as the Black Cat, who became attracted to him. She had stolen a stone tablet sought by the Kingpin, and Elektra was hired to retrieve it. After a fruitless three-way skirmish between Black Cat, Elektra and Spider-Man, Peter and the Kingpin both figured out the Black Cat was secretly Felica Hardy, who was soon trapped by Kingpin and Elektra. Spider-Man’s arrival allowed her to get free, and she threw the tablet into the river, only to be seemingly slain by Elektra. Several of Spider-Man’s foes, led by Norman Osborn, escaped S.H.I.E.L.D. captivity. Fearing for Peter, Fury brought him to the Triskelion base used by the Ultimates, and placed his loved ones under observation. The escapees attacked the Triskelion and captured Peter, blackmailing him into joining Osborn’s “Six”. This group attacked the White House but was opposed by the Ultimates, who informed Peter that Aunt May was safely in protective custody, prompting Spider-Man to turn on Osborn and help the Ultimates recapture the criminals. While Aunt May visited Florida, Peter heard a Spider-Man movie was being filmed and angrily confronted its film crew, but learned he had no legal recourse to stop the film. Equally put out by the news, Doctor Octopus attacked the movie set; when Spider-Man stepped in, Octopus defeated him and abducted him to Brazil, where Spider-Man bested Octopus in a rematch and hitched a ride back to the States in the cargo hold of a passenger jet. He narrowly beat his aunt home, only to be confronted by an angry Gwen, who had figured out his double identity and blamed him for her father’s death. Peter managed to convince her otherwise, and she forgave him, joining his trusted circle of confidants. A short while later, the movie opened to huge box office. Spider-Man stopped the maniac Gladiator, who had taken hostages in a museum, and met Captain Jeanne De Wolfe of the NYPD. Injured by Gladiator’s blades, he sought medical assistance from Dr. Conners, who later experimented with Peter’s blood in search of cures for disease, having obtained Peter’s reluctant permission to do so. A few months later, a creature Conners had created by mixing Peter’s DNA with his own reptile-infected DNA escaped, killing a number of people, including Gwen Stacy, as it followed echoes of Peter’s memories back to his home. Peter accused Conners of being behind Gwen’s death, and Conners revealed what he had done, just as the creature came out of hiding. Peter attacked it, eventually tricking it into leaping into a fiery factory smokestack. Later, an angry Peter convinced Conners to turn himself in. Deciding that Spider-Man had caused enough death, Peter told Mary Jane he was dropping his dual identity; but he could not avoid his sense of responsibility, stopping a mugging while wearing a makeshift mask, and soon realized he could not quit. When the X-Men’s Jean Grey used her telepathy to punish Wolverine for an indiscretion, she unwittingly swapped the minds of Spider-Man and Wolverine, trapping each in the other’s body. After a series of misadventures, the duo foiled another robbery attempt by the Shocker before Grey restored them to their rightful bodies. Later, Peter enjoyed a trip to the beach with Mary Jane, Kong, Liz and a new kid in school that Liz liked, Johnny Storm. After the secretly superhuman Storm was unexpectedly ignited by their campfire and flew off, he came back the next day to apologize to Liz; as Spider-Man, Peter offered Storm advice and they formed what might prove to be an enduring friendship. Together, they rescued people from a tenement fire.After helping the Ultimates capture a rogue cyborg, Peter accompanied Ben Urich to interview the now-celebrity sorcerer Dr. Strange. Turned away by the Doctor’s manservant Wong, Peter sensed something was wrong and returned as Spider-Man to investigate. Witnessing what he thought was Wong attacking the unconscious Doctor, he broke in through the window, unwittingly shattering the mansion’s mystic defenses. The nightmare being who had been attacking Strange pulled Peter into a horrifying dream world until Strange managed to wake him, and Peter fled in terror. When Harry Osborn returned, Peter learned that he had dated Mary Jane prior to Peter, and that he too had been  mutated in the same explosion that empowered Doctor Octopus and his  father. Now mentally unstable and hallucinating, Harry transformed into a monstrous Hobgoblin. He went on a rampage, trying to get Peter to kill him, but Peter refused; when Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. arrived, they took Harry down hard, and an enraged Peter struck the  government man. Peter then left and Fury told his men to crack the code of the Oz drug by his birthday then take away Spider-Man's powers. Afterwards, Peter broke up with Mary Jane, fearful for her safety and feeling he could no longer trust her.Later, Spidey got caught up in a gang war between Kingpin and his rival Hammerhead, and has encountered the mysterious vigilante Moonknight, as well as fighting Hammerhead and the Enforcers alongside Shang-Chi, Iron Fist,Elektra and Black Cat. He has also started dating Kitty Pryde of the X-Men.Recently, Spider-Man was kidnapped along with the X-Men by Deadpool and his Reavers. They were taken to the island of Krakoa to star in a show where mutants were hunted down for crimes they had committed or been accused of. They managed to escape with Peter after the whole ordeal finally feeling ready to reveal his secret to his Aunt May. Upon his return home however, Peter found a message on his answering machine left by his dear Aunt stating she would be staying the night with Miles Warren. So with no need to explain why he was missing for the entire night into the morning he decided to put off telling her for another time.Peter was at a mall with Mary Jane, when a mysterious man wearing a scorpion costume attacked them. When Peter tore the mask off of the mystery man, he saw his own face staring back at him. Confused, he brought him to the Fantastic Four for a DNA test. When the results came back as Peter Parker, Spidey took off his own mask to prove that the man couldn't be him, but, in fact, a clone.",

      "biography": "Young Miguel O’Hara was raised in the alternate universe of Earth-928, during a future time after the end of the “Heroic Age”. He grew up with his eccentric mother, Conchata, younger brother Gabriel, and the abusive man he believed to be his father, George. Brilliant and precocious, Miguel was awarded enrollment in the Alchemax School for Gifted Youngsters (formerly the X-Men’s Headquarters) in Westchester under the fair direction of headmistress Angela Daskalakis. Here he befriended Xina Kwan, who helped Miguel defend himself against the bullying of Kron Stone, son of Alchemax’s Vice President of Research and Development, Tyler Stone. With Xina’s encouragement, Miguel mustered the bravery to have Kron expelled from the school.\n\nYears later, as young adults, Miguel and Xina dated until Miguel cheated on her with Gabriel’s girlfriend, Dana D’Angelo. In time, Miguel and Dana were engaged. Confident and smugly self-assured, Miguel became project head of the genetics program of Alchemax, performing research inspired by the Spider-Man of the Heroic Age involving alterations of animal’s genetic structure. Told he was poisoned by Tyler Stone with an addictive drug called Rapture for quitting after Alchemax fatally used a criminal as a test subject to expedite research, Miguel tried to purge his body clean on a genetic level. Once the drug was bound to his system, he would need it for the rest of his life. Since only Alchemax legally sold the drug, Miguel would have been forced to continue employment at Alchemax or buy the drug through the black market. His experiment to genetically rest his body was sabotaged by his jealous supervisor, Aaron Delgato, accidentally endowing Miguel with fantastic spider-like abilities. After an explosion in the lab, Delgato apparently fell to his death while Miguel fled, realizing his new powers as he avoided the Alchemax sponsored Public Eye security patrol. A Thor worshipper aided Miguel’s escape, deeming “Spider-Man’s” return as an omen of his god’s return. Tyler Stone hired the cyborg bounty-hunter named Venture to investigate the incident. With Venture in pursuit, Miguel returned to his Babylon Towers apartment, and concealed his identity in a full body costume acquired at a Mexican Day of the Dead festival. After a fierce assault, Spider-Man shredded Venture’s circuitry. Upon recounting the events to his quirky holo-agent (holographic assistant) Lyla, Miguel realized his uncertain future.\n\nWith Stone feigning ignorance of Miguel’s transformation, Miguel returned to work, hopeful to find a cure for his condition; but Miguel gradually discovered the importance of Spider-Man in his world, where his own employer was a major source of corruption and oppression. He helped rescue Karyn “Kasey” Nash, Gabriel’s girlfriend, after she was kidnapped by a Zaibatsu Samurai, the Specialist, for Alchemax to perform human experimentation. Spider-Man’s victory over the Specialist earned him the enmity of another major corporation, Stark-Fujikawa, and left him plummeting below the elevated city into Downtown, the realm of the forgotten and undesirables of Nueva York, independent of the major corporations’ control but ruled by gangs. Here, Spider-Man encountered the cruel Watchdogs and Fenris gangs, the hopeful Thorites, the justice seeking Throwbacks, and the largest gang, the Freakers, with their cannibalistic leader, the Vulture. Spider-Man rejected the Vulture’s offer to join his crusade against Alchemax, and after a vicious battle aided by Kasey, Gabriel and the Throwback, he retreated home. While he was away, Dana was approached by Tyler to partner with her firm, Synthia, and Alchemax. Miguel had discovered that Spider-Man had become a hero to his institutionalized mother (alone after George died at a young age) and inspiration for the Spiderite cult of costumed followers.\n\nAfter another battle with the Vulture, Miguel’s world was turned upside-down as he switched places with the Spider-Man (Peter Parker) of the Heroic Age of Earth-616, waking up next to Peter’s wife, Mary Jane, due to Fujikawa (in the Modern Age) and Stark-Fujikawa (in 2099) running experiments on a temporal energy generator. While Peter tackled the Vulture of 2099, Miguel faced Venom (Eddie Brock). The two Spider-Men were united to face the twisted time-traveling Hobgoblin of the year 2211 (Robin Borne) from the alternate universe of Earth-9500. Hobgoblin’s father, Spider-Man (Max Borne) deflected her Retcon bombs into the generations and the ensuing explosion sent everyone back to their respective universes.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, Miguel became more comfortable in his role as a costumed defender. He halted the attacks of the hyper-adaptable Mutagen (Gerald Bernardson), protected the city from disaster from a reawakened Cold War Russian super soldier, Chernobyl, wrestled himself free from electronically transmitted mind control by Macroware software developer Dr. Damian Fawcett, clashed with a specially trained agent heavily armed with SItuation Emergency GEar (SIEGE), and defended Dana from the monstrous Man-Spider (Antoine Tarantella). The mysterious amnesiac Net Prophet (formerly Justice, John Roger Tensen of Earth-148611) was liberated from Interspace after the Virtual Unreality experiments of Euromax transfer, the pretentious scientist Jordan Boone, lured the nigh-unstoppable Thanatos (a Destiny-Force powered megalomaniac Rick Jones of Earth-9309) to Alchemax, where he kidnapped Tyler Stone and Spider-Man, and after the two defended Dana’s sister, Father Jennifer D’Angleo, in Downtown against the Fenris gang, Tensen opted to explore the world.\n\nCaptain Marvel (Genis-Vell) and a critically injured Starfox of the Heroic Age of Earth-616 were sent to 2099. After encountering Spider-Man, Captain Marvel located Miguel to act as their guide. At Alchemax they battled Thanatos, sending the three into the Dystopian alternate future of Earth-9200 ruled by evil future Hulk, Maestro, the other heroes defeated Thanatos, returning everyone back to their original timeline.\n\nWhen Spider-Man battled the savage Bloodsword and the Fenris gang Downtown, back home Lyla began malfunctioning, while at Alchemax Stone made romantic advances towards Dana. Upon his return, Miguel with Dana visited Alchemax’s floating city, Valhalla, where it appeared that Thor and Heimdall had returned, though lacking the nobility of their Heroic Age counterparts. Alchemax CEO, Avatarr, had transformed ordinary people into the Aesir, loyal to the corporation, in order to eliminate the rising super heroic interferance. With help from Doom, Ravage, Punisher (Jake Gallows), the X-Men and Loki ( a transformed Jordan Boone), the Aesir were defeated.\n\nWhile Miguel tried to get back to a normal life, Lyla attacked Dana out of apparent jealously. She and the rest of the city were victims of the mad cyberspace entity named Discord, trying to \"ease humanity into Armageddon\". After saving Stark-Fujikawa’s head, Hikaru-Sama, Miguel joined Gabriel (as “Firelight”) in Cyberspace and defeated Discord. Afterwards, Gabriel admitted to his brother that he knew his secret identity from the start, recognizing the costume from the Mexican festival. Meanwhile, Kasey was kidnapped by SIEGE for Stark-Fujikawa and, as a repayment of Hikaru-Sama’s debt, transformed into Payback, a cyborg warrior designed to be a worthy associate of Spider-Man. Fighting against Risque, Venture’s cyborg sister, Payback failed, leaving Spider-Man alone to defeat the villain. Gabriel was beaten by Alchemax’s Flyboys as they arrested Kasey. While Miguel eavesdropped, Conchatta confronted Tyler to release Kasey, Blackmailing him with evidence that he killed his ex-wife, Nancy. There, Miguel learned the truth that the Rapture he was given was only a short-lasting simulation-and that Tyler Stone was really his father. Miguel left profoundly disturbed.\n\nXina, Lyla’s creator, repaired the holo-agent, spitefully programming her to insult Dana. Offended, Dana accused the emotionally raw Miguel of dating Xina again; after an explosive fight, Miguel and Dana broke up. Later, Spider-Man battled the mercenary android Vlad the Impaler targeting a boy named Gedde Ohara (mistakenly believed by Miguel to be targeting his brother Gabriel O’ Hara), and after Woodstock 2099 fought against Major Jones, a dealer peddling a metamorphosis-enabling drug called Chameleon. For a vacation, Miguel and Xina visited Nightshade, an independent corporation run by their old headmistress, Angela, when Alchemax performed a literal hostile takeover via Mr. Pembert, the Corporate Headhunter, and the six Corporate Raiders. Though the monstrous genetically manipulated ex-Flyboy, Sgt. Rico Estevez (Subject 394, a.k.a Travesty), and Spider-Man defended Nightshade, the Raiders succeeded, killing Angela in the process. Packrat and his scavenger gang of Foragers descended upon the ruins of Nightshade, kidnapping Spider-Man. The gang offered Spider-Man a means of freedom if he fixed an old robot named Junior. The android, apparently the inert body of a Super-Adaptoid, recognized something in Spider-Man, and awakened as an amalgam of O’ Hara’s Spider-Man with Spider-Man and Venom from the Heroic Age. Calling itself Flipside, it behaved like an emotionally unstable psychopath. Heroically, Spider-Man saved his captors life, leaving Flipside shredded and decapitated; however, after Spider-Man departed, Filpside reassembled itself and resumed its assault on Packrat’s gang. On Miguel’s walk home through the desert, he was assaulted and exhausted, having a horrific nightmare before Xina rescued him.\n\nMiguel and Xina attempted another vacation in Mexico City, where they ran into Gabriel and Kasey (who believed Gabe was secretly Spider-Man). There a man named Fernando Morgez performed an arcane ritual to revive his dead sister Anita, inadvertently summoning zombies from a local graveyard instead. Spider-Man, temporarily blinded by Morgez’ spell due to his sensitive eyes, teamed with the Sorceress Supreme, Strange, to end the undead invasion. Distraught over his failure to make amends for his sister’s accidental death, Morgez committed suicide. The four returned back home seeking some normalcy; instead, they found the country had been overtaken by Doom, who sent federal officers to abduct Miguel from Xina’s car. Taken to the White House, Miguel impressed President Doom with his confidence. With all megacorps nationalized under Doom’s control and Avartarr dead, Tyler Stone became Doom’s corporate Minister, while Stone offered Miguel his seat as CEO of Alchemax. Later, as Spider-Man assisted protesting Spiderites brutalized by federal Watchdogs, Doom offered him a cabinet position as Minister of Supernormal Affairs. Disgusted with Tyler and his dubious relationship with Dana, Conchatta surprised Tyler at his apartment and shot him twice.\n\nIn Neuva York, the battle cries of Blood mace (formerly Bloodsword and Bloodaxe) against “leaderless” Alchemax were abbreviated by the return of the Venom symbiote, which engulfed him in an acid-excreting ebony shroud, leaving behind only a skeleton. Venom traveled to confront the hospitalized Tyler, burning Miguel and slashing Dana. Spider-Man and S.H.I.E.L.D. agents engaged in fierce combat to protect Stone from Venom, but the monster escaped. Miguel, accepting his promotion, decided to use his position to forge a new direction for Alchemax, and to protect his alter-ego by ordering S.H.I.E.L.D. reps to leave Spider-Man alone. Venom resurfaced and kidnapped both Dana and Xina; Venom released Xina, while Miguel severed Venom’s arm. After Venom escaped, grabbing Xina again, Miguel authorized S.H.I.E.L.D. to use lethal force. Miguel returned to find Venom had taken Dana again and fled, forcing Xina to drive her car. The battle culminated at the visually askew place called the Escher Club, where Miguel had first met Dana. Dana shoved Venom, allowing Xina to escape, but was killed by S.H.I.E.L.D. bullets passing through Venom. While Venom eluded the authorities, Dana died in Spider-Man’s arms. Miguel returned to Alchemax, demanding answers from his researchers on how to stop Venom. Studying a piece of the symbiote, Miguel realized the symbiote was averse to sound. Broadcasting high intensity sound through the public speaker system, Spider-Man tackled a weakened Venom, discovering that beneath the symbiote was his half-brother, Kron Stone. Miguel separated Kron from the symbiote and forced a confession out of him. After being left for dead by the Punisher, Kron had encountered and bonded with the mutated symbiote, which had been sitting dormant in the sewers for some time. Kron faked his own death, and upon hearing his father had survived an assassination attempt, he had sought to complete the murder.\n\nMeanwhile, Downtown, the Vulture and the mysterious Goblin attacked Kasey Nash, out to prove Spider-Man was allied with Alchemax and the corporate establishment. Summoned Downtown by Gabriel, Spider-Man battled the Goblin. Struggling against the Goblin’s hallucinogenic attack, Spider-Man barely escaped with his life. The Goblin rallied Downtown’s citizen’s against Spider-Man by projecting images of Spider-Man (taken out of context) implicating him as a corporate flunky. Spider-Man left, disgusted by the ingratitude, to find President Doom’s sovereignty at an end as evident by fragments of his Environmental Maintenance Platforms (EMPs) fallen from the sky.\n\nAfter Dana’s funeral, wheelchair bound Tyler Stone attempted to return as CEO of Alchemax. Miguel refused to yield, stating his intention to run a compassionate corporation to serve people, and ejected Stone from the building. Tyler’s attempt to shock Miguel with the knowledge of his paternity had no effect. Miguel discovered that his time as Spider-Man had brought out the best in him, and it was time to become a hero out of costume as well. At Alchemax, Miguel was joined by his brazen mother as the best candidate for his personal assistant, handling even the violent Grunt Union representative, Boru.\n\nUnion problems became a minor issue for Miguel when communications with the New Atlantis project, Alchemax’s undersea research and habitation endeavor, were severed. Miguel learned that Alchemax had been exploiting the undersea mutates, using them for slave labour. The mutates, under leadership of one called Marriner, broke free; and Roman, who modeled himself after the legendary Sub-Mariner, rebelled. Torn between corporate loyalties and ethical treatment of the mutates, Miguel opted to attempt peaceful negotiations; however, Roman took the initiative to launch an offensive, flooding Nueva York and dispatching a leviathan, Giganto. Spider-Man incapacitated and captured Sub-Mariner, and sent the sea-monster home. Via holovid, Tyler confronted Conchata about her assassination attempt, telling Miguel he’s his father, and admitting he knew all along Miguel was Spider-Man. These revelations, however, actually brought Miguel and his mother closer.\n\nTrying to reach Jennifer from the flooded Downtown, Spider-Man fought the Goblin. The Goblin revealed himself to be Gabriel, motivated by jealously for his brother. Chaos reigned in the city as the Atlanteans waged war while the Vulture set charges to demolish the Alchemax building As Tyler attempted to flee to a Martian colony, he was killed by the Atlantean, General Dagim. As Spider-Man and Fr. Jennifer made their escape, Conchatta was believed to have been killed and Alchemax was destroyed. Miguel later learned that Gabriel was innocent, since a shape-shifter took over Gabriel’s life for a time and played the role of the Goblin. Pronouncement of Conchatta’s death was premature, and she later worked to identify the shapeshifter.\n\nAfter the polar ice caps melted, a massive deluge killed most of the world’s inhabitants. The remnants faced a new threat from space from the techno-organic Phalanx. Spider-Man worked together with Doom, whose foresight ended the invasion at the cost of his life. As society rebuilt itself, Miguel reopened Alchemax and married Xina, Together they reawakened Steve Rogers, offering him Thor’ hammer, Mjolnir. Jettisoned into space, Rogers passed Mjolnir back to Miguel, deemed worthy to lift the hammer. Though not physically transformed, Miguel became heir to awesome power. Secretly aided by the Cyberspace persona Zero Cochrane 2.0, Miguel ruled for the next thousand years, ushering in an unprecedented age of enlightenment. Peace, morality and progress that spread from Earth to the surrounding worlds. In 3099, Rogers was once again revived and received the hammer, leaving Miguel to retire. Miguel O’ Hara’s journey from a cowardly, arrogant youth to super-hero to galactic leader and icon was at an end.\n\nNote: Proteus (Kevin MacTaggert) of the “House of M” reality arrived in 2099 via Jordan Boone’s Virtual Unreality portal, diverging a new reality, Earth-6375, one in which Miguel’s dual identity was made public early on. This version of Miguel O'Hara joined the Exiles to help fix damaged alternate realities.",

Jessica Drew has been all of these things, but it seems no matter where her life takes her, it is her destiny to be the high-flying Super Hero known to the world as Spider-Woman.\n\nA Childhood Lost\n\nBorn in 1924, Jessica Drew traveled with her parents, Jonathan and Miriam, to Mount Wundagore, in the small Balkan nation of Transia. There, Jonathan conducted genetics research with Dr. Herbert Wyndham, who would later become the armored man-god known as the High Evolutionary. At seven years old, Jessica contracted uranium poisoning from her father’s work, but Jonathan and Wyndham saved her life through a spider-derived serum and years of hibernation in a genetic accelerator. Jessica spent decades in stasis, receiving subliminal education via special tapes. When she was finally awakened, she was cured, and had aged only to her early teens. She also discovered that she now possessed super human powers—a result of the combination of the radiation exposure and the spider-serum.\n\nJessica eventually left Wundagore to start a new life and met a man with whom she fell in love. But by accident, she apparently killed him with her powers. In the aftermath, Jessica was chased by an angry mob before being rescued by Count Otto Vermis, a high-ranking member of Hydra, the worldwide subversive organization devoted to achieving global domination. Hydra trained Jessica as a field agent, and to control her more fully, Vermis subjected her to memory suppression. He also manipulated Jessica into believing herself to be a spider evolved into human form by the High Evolutionary, which devastated her psyche. Further, Vermis gave Hydra agent Jared Kurtz the task of becoming Jessica’s lover. Outfitted with a special gliding uniform and given the codename Arachne, Jessica was assigned to kill S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury. But, during the mission, Jessica learned from Fury the true nature of Hydra and Kurtz, which led her to abandon the organization.",

      "biography": "Spiral was created to be an agent of Mojo, the despotic leader of Mojo World, often used as his favored personal servant, executioner, and spy.  She, along with Gog and Magog, were sent by Mojo to capture Longshot, the rebel leader who escaped Mojo World and landed on Earth. Spiral, Gog and Magog failed, forcing Mojo himself to come to Earth. Not only did Mojo hope to keep Longshot from returning to Mojo World, he decided to begin a plan to enslave Earth as well. Aided by Ricochet Rita, a stuntwoman and his new love interest, Longshot defeated Mojo, forcing him into an interdimensional portal with Spiral. The heroes also entered the portal in order to continue the fight, but Mojo managed to return Longshot to Earth amnesiac.It remains unrevealed if Spiral later became trapped on Earth or elected to stay, but she next appeared having joined for unknown reasons, the government sponsored team called Freedom Force. (It is suggested that she used this as a means of learning more about Earth). During this time, she battled many opponents such as Magneto, Daredevil, the Avengers and Avengers West Coast, X-Factor, and Firestar. Spiral eventually left the team shortly after a clash with the X-Men in Dallas, Texas, where the X-Men seemingly died in battle with the trickster-god, the Adversary. During her time on Earth, Spiral also created a guise as \"pro-priestess\" of the Body Shoppe, a place where genetics and technology are used to alter people in the same way that Spiral herself was altered. She is responsible for the transformation of Lady Deathstrike, as well as, presumably, many of the cyborg Reavers. Also during this time, Spiral lured Rachel Summers of the X-Men to capture and slavery in Mojo's universe. Similarly, she also helped Mojo capture Besty Braddock, at which point Betsy was given bionic eye implants. The New Mutants rescued Betsy with the help of her brother, Captain Britain, but Mojo had planned all of this from the start, so that Betsy's new eyes would broadcast images of the X-Men to the television-obsessed society of Mojo World.After her time with Freedom Force, Spiral presumably returned to the Mojo's universe, where later, Longshot and Dazzler led a rebellion against Mojo. For reasons of her own, she teleported the X-Men to the universe to aid the rebellion. After Mojo was seemingly killed by Longshot, Spiral teleported away.Spiral was later revealed to be Ricochet Rita from an alternate future, one in which she was abducted by Mojo, transformed by the engineer Arize, and granted the ability to wield magic. (She had long thought of herself as another of Mojo’s humanoid slaves, artificially created through genetic engineering and designed with six arms, rather than only two, so as to ensure Spiral's hatred of other humanoids.)  At one point, Mojo set his sights upon the hero Shatterstar and, with Spiral, captured him. Mojo transformed the hero into a digitized state, mortally wounding him. In an unexpected act of heroism, Spiral transported Shatterstar and Longshot back to Earth, to a hospital where lay a youth named Benjamin Russell. She transferred Shatterstar's essence into the comatose body of Benjamin, physically linking the two. Spiral teleported away, her true motives remaining unclear, but obvious that she held deep feelings for both Shatterstar and Benjamin Russell.On her next appearance, Spiral was marked with a sigil of the Crimson Dawn, although the implications of this remain a mystery. The cultists known as the Dragons of the Crimson Dawn had kidnapped Captain Britain, hoping to use his connection to extradimensional energies to usher in the “coming of the Crimson Dawn,” but Spiral sought out his teammates of Excalibur to help rescue him. Although she claimed capable of using the energies of Crimson Dawn for her own purposes, she chose to help Excalibur and defeat the Dragons, whereupon she teleported away as mysteriously as she came.Spiral was once again at Mojo’s side when the X-Babies needed to use Mojo’s machines to save their teammate Psychilde and, later, when Mojo hoped to kidnap the Exiles’s teammate Morph. Spiral later sought out the sacred blade known as the Five Fingers of Annihilation, a weapon forged to defeat the alien Skornn. She tricked Shatterstar into fighting Dominicus Pierce, its current owner and Spiral’s former lover, but Pierce handed the weapon to him, knowing Shatterstar to be a capable warrior. Spiral then revealed herself and her true intentions, to welcome, not defeat, the Skornn. Shatterstar fought Spiral and agents of her creation, which included Roundhouse, but the battle ended with the two enemies thrown into a portal and landing on an alternate earth, although separated by many years. In the meantime, Spiral became known as Apocalypse, ruling the land with an iron hand. Shatterstar joined an alternate version of X-Force to confront her. After the final, tumultuous battle, Shatterstar reclaimed the fabled Five Fingers blade and returned to Earth.  Spiral was captured, but presumably managed to escape soon after.Returning to Mojo’s side, Spiral encountered Juggernaut and Nocturne who had been sucked into the Mojoverse after falling into a portal created by Xorn. Spiral led Nocturne to believe she had successfully used her powers to possess her and return to the X-Men’s mansion, but in fact she was merely playing possum so that Mojo could capture more X-Men and return them to Mojo World. She transformed the X-Men into “X-Babies” versions of themselves, but the X-Men escaped and soon turned the tables on her and Mojo.",

      "biography": "During World War II, Jacqueline Falsworth bravely served in Britain’s Home Guard. During an air raid attack on London, she had less to fear from the bombing, however, than from the vampire Baron Blood, who attacked her. She was saved by the android Human Torch, who drove the vampire off. Jacqueline invited the Torch and his team, the Invaders, to dinner at the Falsworth Mansion. Her father, Lord Falsworth, then revealed to family and company that there was one other super-hero in their midst — himself! He told of his career during World War I as Union Jack and volunteered the use of his mansion as a base of operations for the Invaders.This did not bode well for the other resident in the mansion, the Lord’s visiting \"nephew\" (really his brother), John Falsworth, who was secretly Baron Blood and a Nazi sympathizer. He arranged for the capture of Jacqueline and her father by a Nazi spy operation which the Invaders had been fighting, and he again attacked Jacqueline, biting her. The Invaders saved Jacqueline and her father, uncovering the truth about Baron Blood, but Jacqueline had been drained of too much blood. She was rushed to a hospital and received a blood transfusion from the Human Torch, who had developed quite a crush on the young woman. She soon discovered that the transfusion of the Torch's android blood, plus the foreign enzymes introduced into her bloodstream by Baron Blood's bite, combined to give her super-human speed. When the hospital was invaded by a Nazi agent in battle armor, called the Blue Bullet, who was looking for the Invaders, Jacqueline used her new powers to save the weakened Torch and to help the other Invaders defeat the Blue Bullet.Jacqueline made herself a costume and called herself Spitfire, after the British fighter plane of the same name. She joined the Invaders, soon helping them recover her brother, Brian Falsworth, from behind enemy lines. The Torch’s feelings went unrequited, as Spitfire had developed her own crush on their teammate Captain America. Spitfire and Union Jack would continue to serve with the Invaders whenever they were in the U.K. Spitfire continued adventuring for some time, as the Invaders became the All-Winners Squad. She also joined her brother and the Destroyer in hunting war criminals. By 1951, they reorganized the V-Battalion with other heroes of the time, becoming the organization’s first ruling Penance Council. She left the V-Battalion after her brother died in a car accident, and retired from adventuring shortly thereafter. During the 1950’s, Spitfire’s super powers had waned significantly and, eventually, completely disappeared. By 1956, Jacqueline married an English nobleman, Lord Crichton. Her husband died sometime after they had a son, Kenneth. She then moved back into Falsworth Manor, to look after her ill father.In more recent years, Baron Blood returned to haunt Jacqueline and her family, and Lord Falsworth called Captain America for help. Captain America was able to destroy Baron Blood, beheading the vampire with his shield, although Jacqueline's father died of an heart attack during the final confrontation. Captain America was aided in battling the vampire by a friend of Jacqueline's son, Joey Chapman, who assumed the identity of Union Jack to help. Initially, Jacqueline disapproved of Chapman's lower class standing, although she did not stop him from continuing his crime-fighting career, and she eventually grew to accept him as a willing successor to her father and brother's legacy.Later, Jacqueline was approached by Namorita, who needed help rescuing Prince Namor the Sub-Mariner and the Human Torch from the latest incarnation of the Nazi villain, Master Man. Jacqueline was reunited with Captain America and Union Jack. In attempting to rescue their ally, Jacqueline raced in the path of a bullet meant for Namor, discovering the last remnants of her super-speed. She was mortally wounded, but after another emergency blood transfusion from the android Human Torch, Jacqueline's metabolism returned to superhuman levels and her Spitfire powers reactivated. A side effect of her returning powers caused her to become young again, as she reverted to the body of a 16-year old. Jacqueline helped Namor on several occasions with his corporation Oracle, Inc., but eventually returned to her home at Falsworth Manor. After her son Kenneth became the new Baron Blood and died battling Union Jack, Jacqueline found herself with no living relatives and discovered that she was now aging at twice the normal rate. Determined not to miss anything life offered, she began a romantic relationship with Chapman. Both were recruited into a new version of the Invaders by the Thin Man, hoping to bring down the group Axis Mundi. After this new Invaders subsequently disbanded, she and Chapman amicably ended their relationship, and she has most recently assisted Chapman and Captain America in defending London from the Red Skull's latest plot.",

      "biography": "Jonathan Ohnn was working as a research scientist on behalf of Wilson Fisk, the Kingpin of Crime. The Kingpin hoped to create a new super-powered henchman to replace the Answer, who was killed after an encounter with Dagger. Ohnn turned his attention to Dagger's partner, Cloak, and used his machines to duplicate Cloak's power to open transdimensional portals. Curious, Ohnn stepped into the portal as the machines shorted out and, as a result, found himself transported to the so-called Spotted Dimension, a crossroads dimension. When he used a portal back to his laboratory, Ohnn found himself covered in spots that were actually portable space warps.At the same time, the heroes Spider-Man and Black Cat were investigating Fisk's building. Calling himself the Spot, Ohnn confronted the heroes and initially managed to thwart them. But when Spider-Man returned later, the Spot battled him again, only to be soundly defeated and traumatized into thinking he could never be a supervillain.After many years, however, Ohnn reappeared as the Spot, teaming up with the lesser-regarded villains Grizzly, the Gibbon, and Kangaroo. The Spot hoped to join the three in a successful crime spree, forming the Spider-Man Revenge Squad. Spider-Man actually threw the fight in their encounter, hoping to bolster the resolve of Grizzly and the Gibbon in becoming \"good guys\" instead. He must have been successful, as the two subsequently turned on their teammates, defeating the Spot and the Kangaroo.At one point, the Spot was captured by the organization known as the Gideon Trust, who forcibly used Ohnn to open a portal to the Negative Zone dimension.  The Gideon Trust hoped to investigate and exploit the natural resources of the Zone for their own purposes.  The Fantastic Four were trapped in the Zone and they defeated the agents of the Gideon Trust before using the Spot’s portal to return to Earth.  In the process, Ohnn seemed to have died.  In fact, the Spot survived and at some point was remanded to the Cage, an internment facility for superhumans. There, he was conscripted to form an unlikely crew with Hypno-Hustler, Rocket Racer, and Big Ben, all led by the sadistic Tombstone. In this manner, the crew was able to survive the challenges of prison, although Ohnn turned the tables on Tombstone, snitching on his activities in exchange for a parole. Even so, Tombstone used the Spot to arrange an escape from prison. He thanked the Spot for his help by killing him, snapping his neck.However, the Spot reappeared months later, contacting his close associate, Slyde, and arranging a meeting. Both were upset at the reports of the Hydra capturing or killing lesser-known supervillains. However, when the Spot arrived, he found a brainwashed Elektra and ninja of the Hand standing over Slyde’s dead body, and he was quickly captured as well. The Spot and Slyde were resurrected by the Hand to join Hydra’s army of superhumans, all orchestrated by the Gorgon. The Spot was among the sixty to seventy agents led by Elektra against S.H.I.E.L.D., but he was felled by S.H.I.E.L.D.’s ally, Wolverine.",

      "biography": "POWERS\n \n\nSprite’s body is augmented by cosmic energy, like other Earth Eternals, and has complete control over his molecular structure. As a result, he can change his physical appearance and apparent age, but will always be mentally a child, and be treated as such by other Eternals. He is virtually immune to disease, aging and extreme temperatures and can regenerate from any injury that does not totally disperse his molecules or cosmic energy. Like other Eternals he can be reactivated by Celestial technology after death, but this process can be stopped by other Eternals. He can manipulate gravitons to levitate objects or fly at 760 mph. He can also teleport himself over great distances, but finds the process unnerving. Without using other powers, he can lift 5 tons. Sprite focused his Eternal powers towards illusion, matter rearrangement and elemental transmutation, surpassed among the Eternals only by Sersi. With the Uni-Mind and Dreaming Celestial’s power, Sprite altered reality on a cosmic scale.\n\nORIGIN\n&nbsp;\n\nSprite is thought to have been born around 1000 years ago, though he has claimed to be millions of years old. Regardless, he is considered one of the youngest Eternals, and by the modern era was physically identical to an 11-year-old human, a source of frustration for Sprite, who felt excluded from some activities more physically mature Eternals enjoyed. He vented by playing pranks, both on fellow Eternals and mortals, including William Shakespeare and J.M. Barrie. When the Dreaming Celestial’s chamber was damaged in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Sprite joined an Eternal Uni-Mind to fix it. In an apparent manifestation of mahd w’yry, Eternal madness, Sprite realized he could use the Dreaming Celestial to change his life.\n\nIn the modern era when fellow Eternal Ikaris brought his human friend Margo Damian to the Eternal’s city Olympia, Sprite scared her by creating a monster and received a public spanking by Ikaris. When most Eternals formed a Uni-Mind to address the Celestials’ threat, Sprite stayed behind to access Zuras’ computers. Uncovering a Deviant plot to bomb the Celestials Sprite broke Zuras’ edict to contact the banished Forgotten One (aka Gilgamesh). Creating a suit for the Forgotten One, Sprite sent him against the Deviant device, helping the Forgotten One earn the name Hero. When Zuras learned of Sprite’s behavior, he ordered Sprite and Hero be each other’s guardians. After Zuras died, Sprite convinced Gilgamesh, to join the Avengers. Free to continue his own plans, Sprite abducted a Greek shepherd, but was discovered by Ikaris before he could do anything else. Next he snuck into Eternal scientist Phastos’ laboratory and sent Olympia to the Negative Zone, claiming this an accident. After the Eternals returned Olympia to Earth, Sprite brought Gilgamesh to Paris, where Gilgamesh and Sprite, disguised as a flying Captain America, fought the sorcerer B’Gon. Sprite also helped when Thena and Kro’s children were threatened, and was present when Ajak sacrificed his life. Suspecting Sersi had succumbed to mahd w’yry, he tried to warn her because the only “cure” was molecular dispersion and death; when she ignored him, he summoned Ikaris and Arex to help her, and when she rejected them too, Sprite encouraged her to officially make Black Knight (Dane Whitman) her Gann Josin (betrothed), hoping Dane could help her. When her case worsened, Sprite demanded her life be spared. Ute the Watcher helped save her by sending her to another&nbsp;\n\ndimension. Later, in a mistaken battle between Eternals and the Fantastic Four, Sprite battled Ant-Man (Scott Lang) before the heroes ended a threat posed by the half-Deviant Maelstrom.\n\nSprite secretly revived Zuras and Ajak from the Reactivation Chamber and fooled them into believing a Uni-Mind was needed in San Francisco, then used their power and that of the Dreaming Celestial to rewrite reality and make all Eternals human. In his new form, Sprite became a child actor and musician named Colin, star of “It’s Just So Sprite” on the Tweenie Channel. Officially, he was a normal human legally divorced from his parents and was a celebrity Superhuman Registration Act supporter. When other Eternals’ suppressed memories began to surface, Sprite brought the partially awakened Makkari to the Dreaming Celestial hoping to attract enough Eternals to make another Uni-Mind, but Deviants and the Avengers interfered, and Sprite fled when the Dreaming Celestial woke. Meanwhile the reunited Eternals discovered Sprite’s work had accidentally attracted the Horde, cosmic creatures that could destroy the Earth. Zuras personally administered Sprite’s punishment, allowing him a mortal death and leaving his body on a train at Union Station in Los Angeles. Though theoretically the Eternals’ Reactivation Chambers could revive Sprite in his Eternal state, Sprite said he would be untrustworthy if revived, and Zuras agreed.",

However, a meeting with Professor Charles Xavier, the telepathic founder of the Xavier Institute For Higher Learning and the team of superhuman mutant adventurers known as the X-Men, changed Sammy's outlook on life, and he was enrolled as a student at the school.Enroute to the Institute, Xavier found himself unable to contact the X-Men.  On investigating, he found them assisting the Juggernaut in battle against their old nemesis - and Juggernaut's former partner in crime - Black Tom Cassidy.  Sammy dove into the ocean and saved Juggernaut's life, forging a bond of friendship between the two.Recently, the team of super-powered Canadian operatives known as Alpha Flight was charged with retrieving all the young mutants residing at the Xavier Institute, as the Attorney General's office, the Governor of Connecticut, and the Canadian government had deemed the Institute unsafe for children to inhabit.  This led to a clash with the X-Men, which was quickly halted after Sammy agreed to accompany the Canadian heroes back to Canada.There, Sammy's father continued to beat him until Juggernaut came to visit. Juggernaut attacked Sammy's father and was subsequently arrested by Alpha Flight. Nevertheless, Sammy's mother left her husband and Sammy returned to the Institute, where he became roommates with Jay Guthrie. One night, Sammy went looking for Juggernaut in the nearby woods and saw him conversing with Black Tom and the Brotherhood. Unaware that Juggernaut was acting as a spy for the X-Men in the Brotherhood's ranks, Sammy confronted him and was killed by Black Tom.",

In between attempts to conceal her odd appearance, she escaped her peers’ taunts in the woodlands, where she bonded with the squirrels and formed a close friendship with one she named Monkey Joe. \n\nIdolizing Iron Man (Tony Stark), based at nearby Stark Enterprises, Doreen made herself a costume and took the name Squirrel Girl, hoping to become his partner.\n\n\n\nSquirrel Whisperer\n\nSquirrel Girl possesses enhanced strength, speed, agility, and reflexes. A super humanly nimble acrobat gifted at climbing trees, she can perform standing high jumps of at least 30 feet. Small claws on each digit enhance her gripping and climbing and are also useful to some extent as weapons in hand-to-hand fighting. Her right hand contains a retractable knuckle spike, larger and more durable than her claws, which can easily carve wood. Her enlarged incisors can chew through solid wood. She has a bushy, semi-prehensile tail, roughly six feet long, which enhances her sense of balance—she can also use it to cover her opponents’ eyes, or to wrap around herself for warmth or protection. Highly flexible, the tail can be fully concealed beneath civilian clothes, albeit somewhat uncomfortably.\n\nAble to mimic squirrel vocalizations perfectly, she can fluently communicate with them and direct their actions, often commanding large numbers simultaneously. She frequently uses multiple squirrels to distract, disorient, or even assault her opponents, and these animal allies often chew through circuitry, wiring, clothing and other materials, attacking targets with their teeth and claws.",

      "biography": "As Herald for the world devourer, Galactus, Stardust found suitable worlds for her master to consume. She performed above her master's expectations as she would track down and destroy any inhabitants of a world that happened to escape the destruction, wiping out any trace of their civilization.Stardust first met Beta Ray Bill as Bill was trying to defend his people, the Korbinites, who happened to be the next target of Galactus. Their planet was eventually lost, but the remaining survivors had transferred their life essences into an orb that Beta Ray Bill would protect until he could find a new world for his people to inhabit. Stardust, however, had other plans as she hunted Beta Ray Bill.  She was determined to wipe out the Korbinite's existence forever. The two engaged in battle and Bill would not fall knowing that he was the last hope for his people. Eventually, Stardust called upon his powers to open a dimensional gateway to banish Beta Ray Bill and his people into, but instead she unwittingly released a foe greater in power and evil than either have ever confronted. Asteroth was now let loose upon the universe, and it was up to both of them to stop her. Galactus, meanwhile, had repaired the damage done to a fallen Korbonite, Alpha Ray, and sent him to intercept Stardust and Beta Ray Bill. Stardust, knowing that Asteroth had to be banished from this plane of existence, used her immense cosmic abilities to create a black hole. Alpha Ray arrived just in time to deal a major blow to Asteroth and drove her into the black hole removing Asteroth as a threat. Stardust became a victim of her own creation as she could not escape the black hole's gravity and was consumed as well. Stardust eventually returned to her master's side and was present at the time of the Annihilation Wave. Galactus sent Stardust to join two other former heralds, Firelord and Red Shift, in opposing the forces of Annihilus before taking the Silver Surfer as his herald once more. While in battle with Anihilus's forces on the planet Daedalus 5, Stardust and Red Shift detected the presence of Galactus, who had been turned into a weapon by Thanos. Stardust saved Gamora during her battle with another former herald, Terrax, and reunited her with the rest of the rebellion. In order to give Nova and his remaining forces time to evacuate, Stardust and Red Shift seemingly sacrificed themselves by delaying the destruction of Daedalus 5 by temporarily holding back the cosmic energies of Galactus before they could consume the planet. Stardust, in time, was able to reform herself in the Andromeda Galaxy unclear of what drew her there. While traveling back to the side of her former master, Galactus, Stardust intercepted a cluster of alien life forces she recognized to be of her race, the Ethereals. The fifty three entities that formed the group explained that the Annihilation Wave wiped out their civilization, and they were the last of their kind. They branded Stardust as a traitor since she was off helping the Corporeals, the Solid Ones, in fighting their war instead of aiding her people and attacked her. Stardust was unwilling to listen to the accusations and struck back using the Power Cosmic to obliterate the entities. However, horrified at her rash actions, Stardust siphoned their essence into her and was willing to use them as her conscience as they now shared a destiny. Finally, Stardust reached Galactus who was in a weakened state because of the energies he used to defeat Aniihilus' forces. Asking to be taken back as herald once more, Stardust was asked by Galactus for a show of loyalty. Knowing exactly what Galactus wanted, no matter how monstrous it may have seemed, Stardust obliged and willingly gave the fifty three beings residing within her to Galactus to feed upon and partially replenish him. Galactus took Stardust back as a second herald and showed her a glimpse of the future where the Silver Surfer will turn on Galactus once more, and Stardust will be called upon to stand at his side. It is then that Stardust revealed that both corporeal and ethereal beings are equally useless to him and only one being in the universe commands her allegiance and her love – Galactus!",

      "biography": "750,000 years ago, Alars, a member of the Eternals of Earth, a cosmic-powered sub-species of humanity, departed Earth after his brother Zuras became the Eternals' leader. Alars journeyed to Titan, a moon of Saturn, where a band of exiled Eternal settlers had slaughtered each other in war. Alars married the only survivor, a young woman named Sui-San, and they transformed Titan into a paradise. Alars ruled the Eternals of Titan as Mentor and created ISAAC, a computer which serviced all of Titan's technological needs.The youngest son of Mentor and Sui-San, Eros had the natural ability to excite pleasure in others, but his power had no effect upon his mutant older brother, Thanos, who worshiped the cosmic embodiment of Death and led an army against Titan. During this assault, Thanos killed and dissected Sui-San, trying to learn why he was born different. While his brother was captivated by Death, Eros loved life, and began visiting other systems for adventure and romance. Eros even visited Earth at least once, and was remembered in Earth's legends. He had many lovers, but his only steady relationship was with the prostitute Heater Delight. Eros later helped Heater escape more than one possessive master, including Dark Roger and Axel the Rescorlan. While she was the property of Pro-Boscis the Procurer, Heater kept Eros from saving her because she didn't want his face damaged; she instead manipulated Pip the Troll into saving her.In recent times, Thanos conquered Titan with another army, slaughtering most of the Titans until Mentor and Eros were the only remaining resistance. Thanos, now seeking the Cosmic Cube, brought Rick Jones to Titan to learn its location. Rick was freed by Mentor, Eros and the Kree warrior Captain Marvel, who had been bonded to Rick; together, they battled Thanos' armies and drove off his lieutenant on Titan, the Super-Skrull. Mar-Vell ultimately bested Thanos by seemingly destroying the Cosmic Cube, and Mentor and Eros were able to rebuild Titan. Mar-Vell became a close friend of the Titans after his help. Thanos, however, had secretly left behind a programming virus compelling ISAAC to act on his behalf. Creating lieutenants for itself, ISAAC took the Titans captive. One lieutenant, Elysius, was attracted to Eros, but she later shifted her affections to Mar-Vell and changed sides when he came to Titan to oppose ISAAC. Mar-Vell ultimately drove Thanos' programming from ISAAC, saving Titan. Mar-Vell soon succumbed to cancer, spending his last days on Titan. Eros was devastated by the loss, and remained close to Elysius in the days that followed. Elysius eventually had ISAAC help her create a son from Mar-Vell's DNA; she named the child Genis. He was raised to believe that Eros was his father, and Eros helped maintain the facade until Genis' accelerated coming of age.Longing for new adventures, Eros visited Earth again and encountered the Avengers battling the Plantman. Eros asked to join their team and was accepted as an Avenger-in-training; but the Avengers were reluctant to present a man named \"Eros\" to the public so the Wasp rechristened him \"Starfox.\" Eros was chagrined to meet fellow trainee Captain Marvel (Monica Rambeau), and he looked down on her, still stung by the death of Mar-Vell. Starfox learned teamwork and responsibility amongst the Avengers, but still found time to engage in several romantic liaisons, including a one-night stand with his teammate She-Hulk. The team also valued Starfox for his scientific knowledge as he was serving on a roster devoid of the Avengers' usual scientific geniuses. After many of the Avengers were taken to Battleworld to serve in the Beyonder's \"Secret Wars,\" the Vision became the Avengers' chairman and promoted Starfox to full membership to fill out the roster. Starfox retained his standing when the other Avengers returned.One evening, Starfox invited himself and the Wasp to a party in Soho which was held by Sersi, a member of Earth's Eternals. When Sersi was brought to the Eternals' city of Olympia to participate in a gathering of all Eternals, Starfox was brought along. In Olympia, he fascinated his Earth-bound cousins with the story of how Alars had founded Titan. Starfox participated in the Eternals' Ritual of the Uni-Mind, merging with them into a single psionic entity; but when the villain Maelstrom tried to siphon the Uni-Mind's power for himself, and the Vision and Scarlet Witch freed the Eternals from the Uni-Mind. Starfox managed to incapacitate Maelstrom with his pleasure powers, which he revealed to the Avengers for the first time. Maelstrom caused his own death by having his servant Deathurge kill him so that he could live anew in another cloned body. The Avengers subsequently thwarted Maelstrom's next plot to halt the Earth's rotation. After seeing Captain Marvel's courage in that battle, Starfox finally accepted her use of his friend's name, apologizing to her for the way he had slighted her. The Avengers became embroiled in a civil war amongst the Skrulls, during which the pirate Nebula seized Thanos' starship Sanctuary II and used it to command a Skrullian fleet to destroy the planet Xandar. When Starfox confronted Nebula, she claimed that Thanos was her grandfather. Before Eros could learn more, Nebula was teleported away by the Beyonder, who had misunderstood the wish of the Xandarian survivor Firelord that Nebula be cast out of the galaxy. Starfox was determined to learn if Nebula's story was true, quit the Avengers to hunt her alongside Firelord. The pair were attacked by Super-Nova, another survivor of Xandar who incorrectly believed Nebula to be one of the Avengers, and Starfox was badly injured, but he soon recuperated and resumed his pursuit of Nebula. He finally caught up to her and helped the Avengers thwart her attempt to harness the Infinity Union, a device of the Stranger's which could grant her cosmic power.Soon afterwards, Thanos obtained the Infinity Gauntlet (which housed the six Infinity Gems) and used it to offer the universe to Death. Thanos took Starfox hostage during the crisis so that his brother could witness his actions, but Thanos allowed himself to be beaten, not truly desiring victory in the end. Starfox continued to serve as an occasional Avenger, participating in the Avengers' mission to the Shi'ar Empire during the Kree-Shi'ar war, as well as joining the Avengers against Morgan Le Fay when she mastered the power of the Twilight Sword. In the aftermath of that battle, Starfox befriended his fellow Avenger Tigra, and she set off into space with him to visit Deneb-VII. Tigra soon became bored of Deneb-VII, but the duo found new excitement when the universe was threatened by the Infinites, cosmic beings from another universe who had no regard for the lives of lesser beings. Starfox and Tigra teamed with Jack of Hearts, Quasar, Thor, Photon and Moondragon to face the Infinites. Starfox helped appeal to the Infinites through Eternity, the embodiment of space, and one of the Infinites ultimately chose to sacrifice itself to repair some of the damage they had done. Later, Starfox led a small army of Eternals in attacking Thanos (or possibly one of the \"clones\" known as the Thanosi) during his quest for the Celestial Messiah, but they were soundly defeated and Eros was cast into outer space, beaten senseless. Starfox later confronted the time-traveler Thanatos, a version of Rick Jones from another reality intent on gathering items of power. Thanatos struck Starfox in the neck with the Spear of Destiny, causing a wound which could not be healed, then threatened to kill him unless he brought Rick Jones (now bonded to Genis) to him. Starfox was forced to comply, but Rick and Genis were able to defeat Thanatos in the end, reversing his actions. After Genis' power of cosmic awareness drove him insane, Starfox joined with Elysius, Mentor and the other Titans in opposing him; they were ultimately able to help Genis regain his sanity.",

Obsessed with the experiments Connors did to create the Lizard, Stegron stole the dinosaur DNA and injected himself. In moments Stegron was turned into an orange stegosaurus type creature. Now bent on turning all humanity into creatures like himself he took several dinosaurs with him from the Savage Land to New York. There he encountered Spider-Man, Black Panther, and Ka-Zar. During the battle that followed Stegron was beaten by being knocked into a nearby river.\n\nMonths later Stegron returned and blackmailed Connors into helping him restore several dinosaur remains from a museum. Connors did what Stegron asked and accidentally turned into the Lizard. The two reptiles clashed as Spider-Man showed up and put Stegron into hibernation using the extremely cold temperatures the weather was producing. Months later Stegron, now back in his human form, woke from hibernation and wandered New York. During a battle between the Vulture and Spider-Man, Stegron regained his powers and joined many of Spider-Man's enemies in an all out battle to defeat him. However Stegron was knocked unconscious and was taken in by the authorities.Stegron managed to escape and headed back to the Savage Land. While in the Savage Land he took over a S.H.I.E.L.D. installation which drew the attention of Thunderstrike, the Black Widow, and the Black Panther. During the battle over the installation Stegron was forced into an extremely cold environment and again went into hibernation. Sometime later Stegron managed to awaken from his slumber and terrorized Roxxon Oil, who was illegally drilling in the Savage Land. Soon Stegron was opposed by Ka-Zar, Shanna The She-Devil, and Spider-Man. During the battle the Hulk and a gigantic bird creature known as Chtylok arrived and helped Stegron fight off Roxxon Oil. The heroes then joined forces with Stegron when they realized he was trying to protect the Savage Land. Eventually Stegron managed to scare the Roxxon agents and was left in peace in the Savage Land.Sometime later Stegron, reverted back to his human form, exiled himself to wander the Arctic Circle when he stumbled upon the Rock of Life. Inspired by its de-evolving abilities, he took it with him back to New York where he slowly began to transform back into his dinosaur form. He then sent the Rock to a friend of his who then put it on display at the Museum of Natural History in hopes that it would devolve the inhabitants of New York City into prehistoric creatures like himself - with him as their leader. As a result, various heroes and villains with connections to the animal kingdom such as Spider-Man, Puma, Black Cat, the Vulture, Lizard, Man-Wolf (John Jameson), and Vermin were affected by its power, causing an increase in their savagery. However Spider-Man maintained control, and discovered Stegron's plans at the museum where the two battled. With the help of Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman Spider-Man managed to stop the Rock's powers from reaching others in New York using a piece of his armor. He then beat Stegron into submission. Stegron was then taken into custody by the authorities as the Fantastic Four placed the Rock in a secure vault in the Baxter Building.",

      "biography": "In 1602, Doctor Stephen Strange was a physician to Queen Elizabeth I of England. Though he was officially the court’s doctor, the Queen knew of his magical abilities, and quietly tolerated them by occasionally asking him to draw upon them. When the globe began to see raging storms and bizarre weather patterns, the Queen called Dr. Strange and her spymaster, Nicholas Fury, to consult them. Strange believed that it was possible the world was coming to an end. He also volunteered the information that an old man was bringing him a powerful weapon of some sort for him to guard, and the Queen agreed that it should be protected. Strange left soon afterwards, consulting his own dreams with the aid of his wife, Clea, which told him of the approaching Virginia Dare from America; the plight of the four of the Fantastick; and the Grand Inquisitor Enrique and his witchbreed children; before he could take no more.When Count Otto von Doom’s assassins tried to kill Virginia Dare in the court of the Queen, Dr. Strange discovered Virginia’s shape-shifting ability and agreed with her and her Indian protector, Rojhaz, to keep it a secret. The Queen’s servant, Peter Parquagh later came to Strange and delivered a message that he must meet with the Queen, while nearly being bitten by a venomous spider that Strange’s old friend, Sir Richard Reed, gave to him. But before Strange could visit the Queen, she was dead, killed by another one of Doom’s plots. He and his wife, Clea, continued to care for Virginia, who had grown deathly sick after her transformation. The girl soon recovered, though the new King, James of Scotland, was not as kind as his predecessor, and Strange hid Virginia from him and consulted with Fury, who still felt loyal to the Crown of England. Strange warned him in his astral form, but Fury would not listen.Strange’s next astral stop was Doomstadt, where he spoke with the old man, Donal, and promised him that there would soon be a group sent to rescue him and his treasure: the staff of Thor. Strange then brought his facts to Fury and Carlos Javier, advising them that Donal was trapped in Latveria, along with Sir Richard Reed and his crew, and their only chance to save the entire universe was to invade Latveria and free them. After Javier used his powers to discover that Strange believed he was telling the truth, the two agreed and with Strange left in England, Fury, Javier, and his group of witchbreed set out in a flying ship, powered by Jean Grey; flying off to Latveria and the Castle of Count Otto von Doom.As he watched the group leave, Dr. Strange collapsed to the ground and his spirit flew to Earth’s Moon where he spoke with Uatu The Watcher of worlds. He explained to Strange that his kind had watched the universe since it’s beginning, and that he, Uatu, was a very young Watcher, watching a very young Earth. Uatu revealed that a person sent back in time to 1602 had caused the strange weather conditions, and had rebirthed heroes that weren’t meant to exist for more than 300 years, before their time. The only solution was to return the traveler back to his home time, but he revealed this to Strange and made him promise not to reveal it as long as he lived.Luckily for the rest of the world, Strange was soon executed and his spirit told his wife Clea what he had been told by the Watcher. Clea then took his severed head to the New World and Strange explained through it to the gathered heroes-recently back from Latveria-that they must return Captain America to his own time. After the group had found the rift, Strange warned them that they had no more than two days remaining, and thereafter returned to his own death. Clea later gave them his head to bury along with his body, as a hero of the universe.",

      "biography": "Ororo Munroe was raised in Morocco, learning English from American films. Ororo's family was murdered under unknown circumstances, and she fled to America as an illegal immigrant. She stole cars in Harlem before relocating to Texas. Although Storm's mutant powers manifested during her youth, she was too frightened to experiment with them. In Texas, Ororo was mentored and befriended by slightly older car thief Yuriko \"Yuri\" Oyama. However, Yuri soon saw Ororo as a rival, and their friendship ended in a motorcycle chase which Ororo halted with a sudden rainstorm; Yuri lost control and had a seemingly fatal collision with a truck. Guilt-ridden, Ororo continued thieving in Texas, briefly serving time in juvenile detention. At one point she declined an offer to join Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants.Pursued by police after stealing a car, Ororo panicked and lashed out with her powers, almost killing several bystanders before she was caught. The X-Men  arranged her release and recruited her hours later. Still nervous about her abilities, Ororo, now called Storm, learned several new applications of her powers, including the ability to fly, and became attracted to fellow student Hank McCoy, a.k.a. the Beast, whose lifetime of mistreatment made him doubt anyone could love him.Weapon X imprisoned the X-Men, torturing them and mutating Beast into a furry, animal-like form. When they were eventually freed by the Brotherhood of Mutants, Storm tried to kill Weapon X's Colonel Wraith, but Nightcrawler stopped her. Feeling more unworthy of Storm than ever, the transformed Hank ended their relationship. The rift between them widened when Beast inadvertently helped the Brotherhood free Magneto from Professor X's mental conditioning, but they reconciled during the resulting crisis.Still feeling inadequate, Beast left the X-Men when new recruit Angel became attracted to Storm. He soon joined Emma Frost's \"New Mutants,\" but their press conference was disrupted by a Sentinel attack, during which Beast perished. Grief-stricken and enraged, Storm lashed out uncontrollably before Professor Xavier calmed her telepathically. In the tragedy's aftermath, Storm drastically altered her hairstyle and clothing to distance herself from her time with Beast. She also became more predisposed to act as the team's conscience, preventing Rogue from killing Sinister just as Nightcrawler prevented Storm from killing Wraith.Storm gradually bonded with Wolverine, and they shared a kiss while searching for an abducted Rogue. When Rogue chose to accompany her abductor, rejecting and insulting Wolverine, he left the X-Men. Storm pursued him to Canada, where both were attacked by Yuri, now transformed by Weapon X into Deathstrike. Storm ended their fight with a lightning strike to both women. Storm was resuscitated by Wolverine  They both returned to the X-Men, their feelings still unresolved.",

      "biography": "By his own account, the Stranger is a composite being possessing the combined strength and intellect of the billions of humanoid beings who once lived on the planet Gigantus, an ancient world in the Andromeda Galaxy whose size approached the limit at which a planet can exist before fissioning into a sun. Gigantus, the home of a highly advanced and pacifistic people, was the target of the imperialistic race of Eternians, who decided to destroy Gigantus when it proved too big to conquer. Before their world’s destruction, however, a vast fleet of Gigantian escaped to retaliate against their attackers. After destroying Eternus, the Gigantians in some as yet unknown way melded their minds into a single being, apparently to one day combat Eternians’ similar composite entity, the Overmind. It is not yet known what the process of this merger entailed: whether the composite-form’s body is an artificial organic construct or one of the Gigantians’ bodies enhanced to be a suitable receptacle for his race’s mental and physical might. This being, later to become known as the Stranger, has existed for some eons now, engaged in the same pursuit of knowledge that had engaged his race.The Stranger happened upon Earth in the mid-20th Century, apparently attracted by the sudden proliferation of superhumanly powered beings on Earth. Investigating some of these beings the Stranger encountered Magneto and his Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, and the original X-Men. The Stranger took Magneto and the Toad with him to his home-base to study. Apparently from his observations of Magneto and the Toad, the Stranger concluded that the powers in the process of development by the denizens of Earth would be misused and, in time, become a threat to other worlds. Thus he journeyed to Earth in two occasions for the express purpose of limiting Earth’s population through a random purge. On each of these occasions, he was convinced by the selfless actions of Earth beings (the Hulk and scientist Al Harper) the Earth had the potential for good. After his second attempt to destroy Earth, the Stranger declared it safe from any future reprisals.Since that time, the Stranger has employed his vast powers on behalf of the Earth. The first of these incidents pitted him against his ancient enemy, the Overmind. The Stranger used his superior power to imprison the Overmind on a mole of dust. The second time he assisted Earth in the deactivation of the Null-Life Bomb, the same device that he once invented to destroy Earth’s population. The third time he came to Earth was to thwart a plot by the Olympian god Pluto.The Stranger remains an enigmatic being, studying the phenomena of the universe for unknown reasons, and acting toward other living beings with unfathomable motives.",

      "biography": "Centuries ago, the Straw Man opposed the demon Kalumai. During one of their early battles, the Straw Man ripped one of Kalumai's horns from his head and closed the gateway through which Kalumai manifested on Earth, sealing it behind an oil painting known only as \"The Scarecrow\". The Cult of Kalumai was virtually destroyed, and over the succeeding years the painting traveled from hand to hand as occultists tried to fathom its secrets and Kalumai attempted to reopen the gateway. Eventually, the painting resurfaced in New York. Cultist Gregor Rovik attempted to purchase it, but when writer Dave Duncan forcibly intervened so his younger brother Jess could win the painting, the Straw Man's attention fell on Dave. When Rovik stole the painting and tried to sacrifice Jess' girlfriend Harmony Maxwell using Kalumai's horn, the Straw Man apparently possessed Dave as the Scarecrow, reclaiming Harmony and the painting, and gruesomely destroying Rovik upon an animated tree, leaving Dave with no memories of these events. Kalumai's agent Bartolome sought to retrieve the horn by piping night demons through the gateway, but the Straw Man banished Bartolome and his demons. When the painting was publicly displayed, Kalumai found a sympathetic onlooker and recreated him as an avatar of his power. While the possessed man battled the Fantastic Four's Thing (who had accompanied his blind artist girlfriend Alicia Masters to the showing at the request of Jess Duncan, who wanted his help in unraveling the mystery of the Scarecrow), the Straw Man presumably controlled Dave. Tricking Kalumai's pawn into sealing the painting/gateway permanently with Kalumai's own power, the Straw Man vanished into the burning painting, apparently taking Dave Duncan with him forever. Later, the Straw Man joined the convocation of Fear Lords, powerful demons who thrive on fear. The Straw Man attended only to inform the others that Earth was under his protection and he would oppose their plans. To aid humanity in resisting their fear-mongering, he manifested under the name Skirra Corvus and created the \"Horror TV\" cable network to inoculate humanity against fear. Informing Dr. Strange of the Fear Lords' actions, the Straw Man's avatar was destroyed by the Lurking Unknown but left Strange the Scarecrow painting, through which he could return. When D'spayre betrayed the Fear Lords and absorbed their powers, the Straw Man returned and sacrificed yet another manifestation of himself to free Dr. Strange and defeat D'Spayre. The Straw Man continues to observe humanity from his otherworldly home. Though he has acted as Earth's self-proclaimed protector, his true origins and motivations are known only to himself.",

Eventually, he recovered, but X-Factor at that time had dissolved its government ties, and Guido retired from full-time crime-fighting.Recovering, Carosella returned to Cheney's employ for a time before becoming involved with the underground mutant fighting league the Arena. Liberated by Storm of the X-Men, Carosella subsequently joined the X-Factor Investigations agency in Mutant Town run by his former X-Factor teammate and best friend Jamie Madrox. The ever-jovial Guido Carosella uses humor to cover up the constant pain he's suffered from the moment his mutant nature manifested and deformed his body. Despite his less-than-serious nature, Carosella is a formidable fighter, having held his own against the likes of the Blob and the Hulk.",

      "biography": "Stryfe is the clone of Nathan Christopher Summers, alias Cable, the son of Cyclops of the X-Men. Nearly two millennia in an alternate future, the aged mutant Mother Askani, alias Rachel Summers, led the Askani cult which opposed the rule of Earth by the long-lived mutant tyrant Apocalypse. In need of a powerful warrior who would oppose Apocalypse, Mother Askani sent a female member of the cult back to the X-Men's own time period. The Apocalypse of that time infected the infant Nathan Christopher Summers with a techno-organic virus that was rapidly spreading through his body and, if not stopped, would kill him. The Askani cult member persuaded Cyclops to let her take the infant to the far future, where advanced medical science could save his life. Once the infant Nathan had arrived in the Askani's time, Mother Askani had him cloned, so that if Nathan himself died, the cult could raise his clone to be their savior. The clone's growth was greatly accelerated until he was the same age as Nathan himself. The Askani succeeded in halting the spread of the techno-organic virus in Nathan's body, thereby saving his life. However, Apocalypse and his forces then invaded the Askani's hiding place. Apocalypse found the infant clone and decided to raise him himself. The Askani took the original Nathan to safety, and he was raised to early adolescence by Cyclops and his wife Phoenix, whom Mother Askani transported to the Askani's time period. Apocalypse named the clone Stryfe and encouraged the boy's arrogance and cruelty as he grew into adolescence. Stryfe was watched over by Apocalypse's aide Ch'vayre, who regarded the boy's malevolence with mixed feelings. Neither Apocalypse nor Stryfe was aware that Stryfe was actually a clone. At this point in Apocalypse's millennia-long existence, he had to transfer his consciousness and life forces from one body to another to maintain his life. When his current body grew too old and feeble, Apocalypse intended to take over the powerful young body of Stryfe. Apocalypse's plans were thwarted, however, when he was killed by the adolescent Nathan Summers, who became known as Nathan Dayspring Askani'son, and later as Cable. Stryfe went into hiding with Ch'vayre and eventually became the military leader of the new dictatorship that arose in Apocalypse's place, the New Canaanites. Cable, meanwhile, became the foremost military leader of the New Canaanites' opposition, the Clan Chosen. During the war between these opposing forces, Cable and Stryfe clashed repeatedly, becoming bitter enemies, even though neither was aware of the true relationship between them. Eventually Cable went back in time to the Twentieth Century, hoping to change the course of history by stopping Apocalypse back then. Stryfe fled to the Twentieth Century himself and organized the terrorist group called the Mutant Liberation Front. Inevitably, Cable and Stryfe came into conflict yet again, first when Cable headed the mercenary team called the Six Pack, and later after Cable had taken over the New Mutants, whom he reorganized into X-Force. At one point Stryfe ordered the massacre of the Native Americans of the Camp Verde Reservation, the original home of X-Force member Warpath, in order to cover up secret, illegal genetic experimentation being conducted in its vicinity. Posing as Cable himself, Stryfe publicly made an assassination attempt on Professor Charles Xavier, founder of the X-Men, and nearly succeeded in killing him. Stryfe defeated Apocalypse and seized control of his team of superhuman warriors, the Dark Riders. Believing himself to be the real Nathan Summers, Stryfe captured Cyclops and Phoenix, blaming them for abandoning him as an infant. As a means of spreading further destruction, Stryfe also introduced the Legacy Virus, a disease genetically engineered to be lethal to mutants, into present day Earth. The Legacy Virus has since infected a large number of mutants and killed many of them. Ultimately, Cable and Stryfe had their climactic battle on Earth's moon. They fell through a time vortex and were seemingly destroyed by a self-destruct device in Cable's battlesuit. In fact, however, Cable survived while Stryfe's body was annihilated. But Stryfe's consciousness projected itself into Cable's own mind and took control after Cable returned to Earth. Eventually, however, Cable's mind reasserted control, and Stryfe's consciousness left his body. Later, Warpath was injected with drugs by the criminal scientist Edwin Martynec that stopped his heart. Warpath's spirit was transported by Stryfe's spirit to the netherworld ruled by the demon Blackheart. Blackheart had promised to let Stryfe return to the world of the living in Warpath's body if Stryfe could defeat Warpath's spirit. But instead Warpath's spirit defeated Stryfe and returned to his body, thereby coming back to life. Stryfe, on the other hand, remains a prisoner in Blackheart's netherworld.",

      "biography": "Namor's father, American seaman Leonard McKenzie, embarked on an expedition to Antarctica in 1920. McKenzie's ship was searching for the Lemurian city rumored to house the mythical Helmet of Power at the behest of one of his passengers, Paul Destine. However, McKenzie distrusted the uses to which Destiny would put the Helmet and caused an avalanche to bury the city. Making his way to safety, McKenzie set explosive charges to break up ice floes in the ship's path, unaware that Atlantis lay beneath the waters.The city sustained heavy damage, and Atlantean Emperor Thakorr commanded his daughter Fen to investigate the cause of the explosions. Startling McKenzie's crew, the blue-skinned princess wound up staying aboard the ship for several weeks. In a strange twist of fate, Fen and McKenzie quickly fell in love and were married. Thakorr, fearing his daughter had been kidnapped or killed, sent an Atlantean war party to search for her. Thinking her a captive, the Atlanteans slaughtered McKenzie's crew and apparently McKenzie himself. Afterwards, Fen returned with the War party to Atlantis. Nine months later, Namor was born the first known Homo sapien - Homo mermanus hybrid.The young prince grew up with a short, nasty temper and a hostile attitude toward surface-dwellers, whom he blamed for the near-destruction of Atlantis. When Thakorr discovered men in diving suits near Atlantis, he assumed they were advance scouts for an invasion force causing the fiery Sub-Mariner to launch frequent pre-emptive attacks against humanity, causing untold destruction throughout New York City and leading him into confrontation with the original Human Torch. When Nazi troops attacked Atlantis, however, Namor joined the Allied cause alongside Captain America and his fellow Invaders.Atlantis largely avoided the damage sustained by the surface world during World War II, but did fall prey to a series of severe earthquakes at war's end that destroyed much of the fabled city and Namor again was dispatched to New York, where he fell afoul of Paul Destiny, who had finally obtained the Helmet of Power and was causing the quakes. His power destroyed much of Atlantis, killing Thakorr and Fen. Under compulsion of the Helmet, Namor returned to New York with amnesia and became a wandering derelict.Eventually, Johnny Storm, the second Human Torch, discovered Namor in the bowery. Burning away the extra hair and substantial beard Namor had grown, Storm dropped the Atlantean in the harbor. The immersion restored most of Namor's memory. Assuming humans had destroyed Atlantis, Namor rashly invaded New York to avenge the destruction of his homeland. Even after the survivors of the Atlantean civilization welcomed him as their rightful king, he stubbornly spent the next several years warring with the surface world, most often opposed by the Fantastic Four. In the midst of his campaign against humanity, Namor developed an attraction to Susan Storm, the Fantastic Four's Invisible Girl. In his regal arrogance, he has courted her for years, seemingly undeterred by Sue's relationship with Mister Fantastic. Though he later realized he couldn't have her, and focused his attentions instead upon his Dorma. Against the surface dwellers, Namor has teamed up with both Doctor Doom and Magneto, though both turned against him once they felt they had the upper hand. With the help of the Fantastic Four, Namor soon defeated both one-time partners.Eventually, Namor realized he had to put aside his hatred for humanity for the good of his people and banned official acts of war against Homo sapiens. Namor even grudgingly began using his superhuman abilities to defense of the surface world. First and foremost, he was the monarch of Atlantis. As such, he was beholden only to his subjects. The Sub-Mariner was a founding member of the loosely knit group of heroes known as the Defenders, brought together with Doctor Strange and the Hulk when an ultimate computer called the Omegatron threatened Earth. However, a curse forced the original three Defenders and the Silver Surfer to part ways. The condemnation was lifted, but Namor did not return to the Defenders at that time. Even though they had saved the earth many times, Namor viewed his duties with this loose-knit band of Defenders a distraction at best. The team eventually disbanded, due to circumstances beyond their control. Later, the founding three Defenders and the Surfer were drawn together once again to battle the forces of evil.  For several years Namor was part of Illuminati, a group of influential super heroes who met secretly to share information. The meetings were kept secret because demands made by Namor. The Illuminati were eventually disbanded after some serious disagreements including but not limited to the fact that Iron Man wanted the Illuminati to support the super hero registration act but most of the others, including Namor, disagreed.",

      "biography": "A sentient bacteria, Sublime arose during the first manifestation of life on Earth. With the rise of multicellular life forms, Sublime had endless hosts to infect and control; however, in modern times, Sublime saw mutant-kind’s evolution as the first real threat to its eternal dominion and sought to prevent mutants from becoming the dominant species. It took a human host in Dr. John Sublime, a scientist employed by the Weapon X project that created the living weapon Wolverine. Moving on to the parent Weapon Plus project, creators of anti-mutant Super-Sentinels, Sublime eventually headed the entire program and sponsored a new Weapon X project led by Malcolm Colcord, who sought revenge against Wolverine for having savagely scarred him. Sublime also used a fortune gained from his host’s successful pharmaceutical company to found the Transpecies Movement, a cult of human “U-Men” seeking to empower themselves by grafting harvested mutant organs to their own bodies. He also penned a best-selling book entitled The 3rd Species outlining the U-Men’s philosophy.After taking the Transpecies Movement public, Sublime purchased an old prison near Hong Kong whose sole inmate was the mutant Kuan-Yin Xorn. Sublime sought to transform the prison into a mutant organ farm, but its plan was thwarted when the X-Men were alerted to the situation by Xorn’s warden, Ao Jun. Sublime later met with X-Men Cyclops and Emma Frost, and used the living brain of mutant Martha Johansson to subdue them for harvesting. Sublime then ordered his U-Men to attack the X-Men’s home at the Xavier Institute to use it as an organ farm, but the X-Man Jean Grey defeated them. Cyclops and Emma escaped and confronted Sublime, whom Johansson telepathically forced to fall from the building, killing its human host. Taking a new host, Sublime rewrote their DNA to match John Sublime’s and set about replicating a part of itself to create the aerosol drug Hypercortisone-D, a.k.a. “Kick,” which enhanced mutant powers while causing violent insanity. As Kick, Sublime compelled student Quentin Quire to cause a riot at the Institute and incited Xorn to launch an all-out attack on New York as Magneto.Later, the Weapon X program’s newest agent, Chamber, assassinated Sublime’s human host, but it simply took on another host body and altered its DNA to become John Sublime once more. The former Weapon Plus agent Fantomex subsequently teamed with Weapon X’s Agent Zero and Wolverine in confronting Sublime, though Sublime’s U-Men forced the trio to retreat. Sublime later posed as Megacorp head Michael Grand to obtain a new breed of genetically-enhanced super-beings created by Mister Sinister to use in an army to oppose Weapon X. For a year, Fantomex killed many of Sublime’s hosts until, during one such attempted assassination, Sublime’s host body was instead killed by Chamber, and it chose Fantomex as its next host. Subsequently, thirty years into the future of at least Earth-5700, Sublime abandoned Fantomex and infected Wolverine, whose consciousness had been sent to the past of Earth-616 to the time of his initial escape from Weapon X. Sublime infected Wolverine’s past body to ensure he scarred Colcord, setting in motion the chain of events that would lead to the future decimation of mutant-kind. Rejected by Wolverine’s healing factor, the Sublime bacteria then infected John Sublime, creating a temporal loop.Note: Despite similarities, there is no known connection between Sublime and the cellular collective That Which Endures or the energy farmer the Harvester.",

      "biography": "The Sugar Man was in charge of the Seattle Core, a slave camp that helped power North America during the Age of Apocalypse. This happened to be the same slave camp that held Illyana Rasputin, the sister of Colossus. As leader and teacher of the next wave of X-Men, Colossus was asked by Magneto to retrieve his sister so Magneto could have access to her reality-traveling powers - power that had become extremely rare in the Age of Apocalypse. Colossus and his students, the team called Generation Next, broke into the core to rescue the young girl. During the rescue attempt, Sugar Man discovered two of Colossus's students and ordered their immediate execution. With their cover blown, the young mutants fought desperately to survive. It appeared the Sugar Man was destroyed by a psionic bio-blast from Chamber in the opening moments of the battle but that was not the case. Sugar Man shrunk himself down and hid in Colossus's boot as the X-Man tried to get Illyana to safety. Following the Sugar Man's apparent death, a huge battle broke out in the Core. Colossus's students fought bravely but were apparently wiped out by the Sugar Man's guards. Colossus was able to escape with his sister, not realizing the miniature passenger he carried along in his boot. Not wanting to give away his position, the Sugar Man remained in Colossus's boot until the final battle in Apocalypse's headquarters. Realizing things were going poorly, Sugar Man dove into the M'Kraan Crystal and traveled back in time to the moment the Marvel Universe and the Age of Apocalypse split. He entered the Marvel Universe and made his way to the island nation of Genosha. While there, he took control of the island. He used his knowledge of the genetic-altering Infinite process to create the mutate slave population that thrust Genosha forward as an industrial giant. The island nation of Genosha had been under reconstruction since the brutal attack of Sentinels controlled by Cassandra Nova. The Sentinels killed close to 14 million mutants in the attack. However, Sugar Man survived deep beneath the surface of the island. Several Magistrates working with the Dark Beast to find a supply vault were slain while working in the catacombs under the island's surface. The Morlock known as Callisto persuaded Wicked, to use her spirit controlling ability to explore the catacombs underneath the island. This search resulted in the spirits being attacked and both Callisto and Wicked suffering the pain through empathic backlash. Callisto and Omega Sentinel teamed up and went into the tunnels together, leading to a violent underground battle with the Sugar Man and the two headed monster Rastus. Callisto killed both men, although she lost her left arm in the battle.",

      "biography": "Shiro Yoshida’s mother was exposed to the atomic devastation of Hiroshima during World War II and died giving birth to him. He was raised by his father Saburo, a member of the powerful Japanese Clan Yashida who pursued a diplomatic career and became Japan’s ambassador to the United Nations. Shiro was often left in the care of his uncle Tomo, a fanatic anti-American. After Shiro’s mutant powers first manifested, Tomo sought to use him as a weapon against the U.S., giving him a costume and calling him “Sunfire.” Soon after, Tomo sent Sunfire, the shapeshifting terrorist Mystique, the mutant power-stealing Rogue, and the memory-stealing mutant Blindspot to steal the formula for bonding the nigh-unbreakable metal Adamantium to a human skeleton from Lord Dark Wind. The mission failed, and Blindspot wiped the memories of those involved.Invited to join Saburo in America, Tomo incited Shiro to attack the Capitol building in Washington, but he was opposed by the heroic mutant X-Men. Saburo sought to reason with Shiro but was shot and killed by Tomo, who in turn was killed by Shiro. Deported back to Japan, Shiro found himself a social outcast for having dishonored his father. He fled to Tokyo’s slums and fell in with the criminal Dragon-Lord of Krakinowa, who sought to restore Japan’s status as a world power. Sunfire was sent to destroy an American cargo ship, leading to conflict with Namor the Sub-Mariner, who made Sunfire realize the ramifications of his actions and teamed with him to defeat the Dragon-Lord. Having redeemed himself, Sunfire was accepted as Japan’s protector. Sunfire soon encountered the American hero Iron Man in Vietnam, but was kidnapped by the would-be conqueror the Mandarin. Iron Man intervened and rescued Sunfire, who then sought revenge, but was opposed by the Mandarin’s giant robot Ultimo. Once again saved by Iron Man, Sunfire began to rethink his anti-American beliefs.Later, Sunfire was contacted by Professor Xavier, who was recruiting a new team of X-Men to help rescue the original group from the living island Krakoa. Sunfire joined up long enough to help defeat Krakoa, but refused to stay with the team as he was devoted to serving Japan. Later, when Moses Magnum was threatening to sink Japan into the sea, Sunfire was unwilling to accept the X-Men’s help; but he was countermanded by Japan’s Prime Minister, who forced Sunfire to work with them. Together, they defeated Magnum, and Sunfire’s opinion of the X-Men improved as a result. Later, the X-Men and Sunfire were among the many heroes forced to participate in the Grandmaster’s Contest of Champions, during which Sunfire battled Darkstar to a standstill. After the giant green dragon named “Puff” attacked Tokyo, Sunfire was sent to work with the X-Men again by his cousin Mariko, now leader of Clan Yashida.Sunfire later investigated the new designer drug “Sleet,” tracing its origins to the island nation of Madripoor, where he teamed with mutant soldier Cable (an old friend of his father’s), the New Mutants and the X-Man Wolverine against the Mutant Liberation Front. Returning to Japan, Sunfire was captured by Doctor Demonicus and brainwashed into serving as a member of his terrorist Pacific Overlords. Sunfire and fellow pyrokinetic Pele were sent to Hawaii to disrupt a ceremony honoring Namor for his World War II heroism. Opposed by Namor and the Avengers, they freed Sunfire from Demonicus’ thrall, and he joined the heroes in defeating the Overlords. The Japanese government soon outfitted Sunfire with a specially-designed suit of armor, the successful test of which inadvertently ruptured a dimensional void that threatened to swallow the entire Earth. Working together, the X-Men and Sunfire resealed the void. Later, after Wolverine became involved in a war between Clan Yashida and the ninja Hand clan, Sunfire came to his aid, but was unable to prevent Mariko from being poisoned. Sunfire was subsequently tasked with escorting a Japanese whaling fleet to Antarctica to protect them from hostile Atlanteans. Sunfire erroneously believed Namor was responsible, but the true culprit was ultimately revealed to be Namor’s rival Attuma.\n\nWhen the X-Men’s nemesis Magneto released an electromagnetic pulse across the globe, the energy overloaded Sunfire’s body and caused his powers to flare out of control directly over Tokyo. This forced the Japanese government to imprison Sunfire, but he was soon freed by his cousin the Silver Samurai and Wolverine to help oppose a government plan to outfit giant Red Ronin robots with mutant-hunting technology. Battling one of the robots, Sunfire’s powers again flared out of control and Wolverine suggested he seek aid from Canada’s Department H, unaware that the Department had fallen into malevolent hands. Informed by the Department’s scientists that he had radiation poisoning, Sunfire remained with them seeking a cure. Unknown to Sunfire, the scientists had injected him with Zero Fluid, a compound that turned half his body jet black and created an ambient charge of bio-kinetic energy within his body that conflicted with his bio-atomic powers. Frustrated by the scientists’ inability to cure him, Sunfire returned home, seeking refuge in an abandoned monastery. There, he was contacted by the Japanese government to join the fledgling super-team Big Hero 6. Sunfire initially declined, but later joined the team to help defeat the Everwraith. Possessed by the ethereal creature, Sunfire resisted its attempts to release his powers, but when his young teammate Hiro learned the truth of his condition, Sunfire expelled the entire bio-kinetic charge instead, dispersing the Everwraith. Eventually, the Zero Fluid was removed from his system, and he was assigned to work as a field agent with the Yakiba, the Japanese military intelligence. His first mission was to expose a shapeshifter that had infiltrated the military. Mistakenly believing this to be Mystique, Sunfire sought her out, but encountered Rogue instead. Together, they discovered that the true culprit was an alien Skrull who had been watching Sunfire as part of an alliance with the eternal mutant Apocalypse and his plans involving the legendary Twelve, mutants supposedly destined to usher in a golden age for their kind. In truth, Apocalypse sought to gather them together so as to siphon their collective powers to grant himself godlike power, and to that end he sent his Horseman Famine to capture Sunfire. Ultimately, the Twelve were able to break free, and Apocalypse was defeated.After the mystic city of K’un-Lun began appearing in the midst of Tokyo, Sunfire teamed with several American heroes to prevent its full manifestation. A short time later, Sunfire was approached by the feral mutants Sabretooth and Wild Child with an ultimatum to join the subversive Weapon X organization. Sunfire declined and attacked Sabretooth, but was in turn shot by Wild Child and left for dead. Sunfire survived this encounter and soon after accepted an offer from Xavier to join the X-Corporation, a global mutant search and rescue operation, in its Mumbai, India headquarters. Still acting as protector of Japan, Sunfire encountered the alien Titannus, who sought to forcibly recruit Earth’s heroes into an army to wage intergalactic war. Titannus easily defeated Sunfire, and then attacked Tokyo, resulting in several of Earth’s heroes teaming up to defeat him. Later, Sunfire was implicated in Clan Yashida’s criminal activities and his status as Japan’s protector was suspended. Sunfire sought to clear his name and joined with Rogue to oppose the perpetrator, Dark Wind’s daughter Lady Deathstrike. In the ensuing clash, Deathstrike severed Sunfire’s legs and defeated Rogue, imprisoning them both with Deathstrike’s other captive, Blindspot. Sunfire bade Rogue absorb his powers, and he seemingly died from the strain. After Deathstrike was defeated, Rogue returned to her hideout, but Sunfire’s body was gone. During the mutant Scarlet Witch’s reshaping of reality, Sunfire was seen alive and well as the Emperor of Japan.*Following the events of \"House of M|M-Day,\" Sunfire was revealed to have been captured by Apocalypse, who transformed Sunfire into his newest Horseman Famine.",

      "biography": "Sunset Bain was always a highly motivated genius with both money and personal connections. At M.I.T., she romanced an undergraduate Tony Stark, gaining access into his parents' company. Donning a simple green bodysuit with a wig and a nearly undetectable mask, Sunset became Madam Menace.  She hired underlings to break into Stark Industries, and within a year launched her own company (Baintronics, Inc.), partially based on prototypes stolen from Stark and others. Bain soon dropped Stark and moved on to other targets. Sunset and Baintronics subsequently cultivated a spotless public image, courting senators, celebrities and billionaires. Meanwhile, Menace built a lucrative business supplying sophisticated weaponry to the criminal elite, a tremendously profitable underground seasonal \"Sharper Villain\" catalog of armaments. When Machine Man lost an arm fighting Baron Brimstone, it was stolen and sold to Madam Menace, who intended to reverse engineer it and create her own robot army. When Machine Man came for his limb, Menace personally confronted him, capturing him via her directed EMP technology and an electro-magnetic stasis field. Menace engaged in negotiations to sell the robot, but Machine Man escaped; Bain escaped by blowing up her yacht. Bain adapted a sonic disruptor and recaptured Machine Man, but Alpha Flight freed the robot. When Machine Man was later attacked by a Termini (a larval form of the planet-destroying Terminus), Iron Man brought the damaged Machine Man (and the head of the destroyed Jocasta) to Sunset's Seattle-based Baintronics headquarters. Using her Duplikatron technology, Madam Menace created replicas of Machine Man and Jocasta's head. She returned a slightly defective version of Jocasta's head to Machine Man when he recovered and retained the original Jocasta and duplicate Machine Man for research.The mercenary Silver Sable once attempted to capture Menace at an underworld armaments demonstration.  Menace and her client (Dr. Octopus) escaped from Sable operatives Sandman and Hawkeye. Bain has supplied armaments to the Orb, and worked with the New Enforcers, allowing her to study the Dreadnought, Super-Adaptoid, and Dragon Man, among others. She also employed Stuart Clarke (Rampage) and Parnell Jacobs (War Machine) to gain access to their armor. When Bain failed to decode Jocasta's AI, she recruited Tony Stark to do the work, sending War Machine to destroy Stark's current employers when Stark declined. Suspicious, Stark accepted, quickly deducing Jocasta's identity and freeing her, while also convincing War Machine to quit. Bain later hired the Taskmaster to destroy Stark Enterprises' latest semiconductor technology. Taskmaster succeeded but Bain betrayed him to the police. Taskmaster retaliated by forcing a war between Baintronics and the Triad gang, and he continues to stalk Sunset.",

It started with an opponent knocking da Costa to the ground, spitting a racial remark, and Bobby responded with a heated temper, sparking his mutant power and beating his opponent into the ground. Although confused after regaining his senses, da Costa was abandoned by all except for his girlfriend, Juliana. This attracted the attention of Donald Pierce, renegade White Bishop of the Hellfire Club, who attempted to kidnap da Costa but failed, taking Juliana instead. Charles Xavier intervened, sending his formative New Mutants to help da Costa confront Pierce. In the battle, however, Juliana took a bullet meant for Bobby. Consumed with grief and anger, da Costa helped defeat Pierce and accepted Xavier’s invitation to join the New Mutants. Taking the code-name Sunspot, da Costa served with the New Mutants, learning more about his powers and participating in many adventures.\n\nAt one point, he was reunited with his long-lost mother who, because she was an archeologist on an expedition, had remained estranged from her son for many years. She invited Roberto and his teammates to join her on an expedition in Brazil, but unknown to all, Roberto’s father, Emmanuel da Costa, had formed an alliance with the Hellfire Club and was determined to stop her, as he had business interests in the same area. The Club’s assassin, Axe, failed to kill her, thanks to the New Mutants, and her expedition soon led to the discovery of Nova Roma and the New Mutant’s subsequent recruit, Magma. Emmanuel da Costa would go on to become a member of the Inner Circle of the Hellfire Club, the same group that originally tried to kidnap his son. Despite his Roberto’s protests when he found this out, his father went on to become the White Rook of the Inner Circle.\n\nSunspot left the New Mutants at one point, feeling that the others blamed him unfairly for using his powers and injuring their teammate Cannonball during a soccer game. He made his way to Los Angeles, followed by the Warlock, and encountered the gang called the Fallen Angels. The two stayed with the Fallen Angels for a brief time, until it was revealed they had been gathered by Ariel, who was a member of an alien race studying mutations. Ariel betrayed the Angels to her alien race, who kidnapped the team for study. Sunspot helped the Angels escape, after which he and Warlock returned to the New Mutants.\n\nJust prior to the disbanding of the New Mutants, Sunspot learned that his father had died, and he was contacted by Gideon, a businessman and mutant who wanted to help da Costa assume his new role as leader of the da Costa family fortune. In reality, Gideon was a member of the Externals, a subset of the mutant race who believed themselves immortal, and they believed da Costa to be an External as well. Gideon initially groomed Bobby for his role as an External, even to the point of being responsible for his father's death by poisoning him. However, Gideon soon discovered that he wrong. He instead subjected Bobby to hideous experiments. Sunspot was later rescued by his friends who now made up the team X-Force, and Sunspot joined their number.\n\nOne of Gideon’s experiments was the attempt to reproduce Sunspot's powers in another being. A test subject named \"Project 19\" was given a transfusion of Sunspot's blood, resulting in the being Reignfire. Reignfire became the leader of the Mutant Liberation Front, and when the team clashed with X-Force, he hinted that he was actually Sunspot. About the same time, the true Sunspot entered a transport portal when battling the M.L.F.’s Locus and was separated from his team. Unfortunately, it was months before X-Force encountered Reignfire again, and when they did, their leader, Cable, used his telepathic powers to “restore” Sunspot/Reignfire’s memory, since they believed that Reignfire must be a version of Sunspot from the future.\n\nIn fact, Reignfire had captured Sunspot through a telepathic link between them that gave Reignfire all of Sunspot's memories and allowed him to control the mutant. Reignfire then switched places with his counterpart, convincing X-Force that Sunspot was Reignfire instead, controlling Sunspot to the point that it he still appeared to be Reignfire leading the M.L.F. Shortly, however, Cable discovered the truth, breaking the telepathic link and ousting Reignfire. Still, Reignfire retained Sunspot's powers and memories, and in their next encounter he was able to siphon Sunspot's powers into his own body. In his final battle with X-Force, Reignfire's physical form was destroyed by a molecular disruptor, and he took possession of Sunspot's form. With the aid of the disruptor and his teammate Siryn, Sunspot eventually regained control. Sunspot then drained Reignfire of all of his energy, leaving him powerless.\n\nDa Costa was later blackmailed into joining the Hellfire Club by its Black Queen, Selene. Selene originally taunted Sunspot by claiming that Damocles Foundation, formerly run by Gideon, was seeking to begin a new experiment similar to the process that created Reignfire. The two raced to stop it, and they were joined by X-Force. However, Selene wanted the process for herself, and she subdued Sunspot and X-Force. She then offered to resurrect the spirit of Juliana, Sunspot’s first love, in exchange for his agreement to become a member of her new Hellfire Club. Sunspot, distraught, agreed, although Juliana was resurrected in the body of an unknown girl. Sunspot agreed, although whether or not he was truly reunited with Juilana was never revealed.\n\nPresumably, many of Sunspot’s allies remain unaware of his involvement with the Hellfire Club, as Bobby also served as head of the Los Angeles branch of the X-Corporation before its dissolution. About the same time, he was approached by Sebastian Shaw who claimed to be the Club’s Lord Imperial, Once again, Donald Pierce appeared to challenge Shaw. Pierce was defeated with the combined efforts of both the X-Men and Shaw, being decapitated in the process. Even so, Shaw was severely injured, and he stepped down to allow da Costa to become the Lord Imperial.\n\nRecently Sunspot left the Hellfire Club (after also form a new Brotherhood of Mutants along with other former New Mutants) and now he is instructor of the Young X-Men team.",

      "biography": "After the Fantastic Four stopped the Skrulls' attempted invasion of Earth, Skrull Emperor Dorrek invested vast resources into creating a superbeing of his own. K'lrt, a decorated soldier and warrior of the Skrull empire, was chosen to undergo a process that endowed him with all the powers of the Fantastic Four, except, when powered by an interstellar beam, far stronger.  When the Super-Skrull first confronted the Fantastic Four, he bested them with their own abilities until Mister Fantastic identified the power source beamed from the Skrulls home planet and created a jamming device, depriving the Super-Skrull of his powers. Then the Invisible Girl tripped him into a crater and the Human Torch melted the rock around it to seal him in.  Realizing their champion's predicament, the Skrulls developed a stronger source of power and beamed it to him. Re-powered, the Super-Skrull, disguised himself as Doctor Franklin Storm, the father of the Invisible Girl and the Human Torch, and again attacked the Fantastic Four. He called himself the Invincible Man, and claimed that he had received his powers in the Skrulls' prison laboratory. But Mr. Fantastic soon discovered the truth and threatened the Skrull homeworld with a fight to the death with the Super-Skrull and a direct atomic attack on their homeplanet.  The Skrulls recalled the Super-Skrull and sent Dr. Storm back, although they first booby-trapped him with an explosive in an attempt to destroy the Fantastic Four. Storm, however, threw himself on the floor and took the brunt of the explosion to save his family and their friends, killing himself.His repeated defeats at the hands of the Fantastic Four allowed the Super-Skrull to fall out of favor with his government.  Despite a second chance against the thunder Thor, the Super-Skrull was exiled. However, due to the loyalty to his race and his extreme power levels, the Skrulls have usually found they have need of the Super-Skrull, recalling him to service time and again. For example, Dorrek once hoped the Super-Skrull would the Kree Captain Marvel), disrupting the Kree from their surveillance of Earth, but Captain Marvel turned Kl'rt's power against him. Another time, he was drafted into the then-ongoing Kree-Skrull War, fighting the Avengers but hoping to take advantage of the war to increase his own political standing. This time, he was sent into permanent exile for treason. Working as a free agent, the Super-Skrull became an agent for Thanos the mad Titan, running once more into Captain Marvel. This time, his defeat left him stranded on Earth without interstellar transportation. Hoping to power a starship and flee the planet, he tried to steal the Cavourite crystal but was confronted by Ms. Marvel and Spider-Man. The Super-Skrull routed the two, but when he captured the crystal, its energies interfered with those of the interstellar beam that boosted his powers-- he found himself teleported to the Skrull throneworld. Unfortunately, he could never regain his physical form. The throneworld soon fell victim to Galactus, and the process of the planet's destruction send the Super-Skrull's disconnected form back to Earth, where it became trapped in the Van Allen Radiation Belts. Eventually, a group of scientists, including Dr. Walter Langkowski, a.k.a. the hero Sasquatch, made contact with the Super-Skrull's atoms with their equipment, inadvertantly allowing the Super-Skrull to reincorporate. The Super-Skrull's elation at being free was tempered with the fact that he was now physically dying. As a result of his entrapment within the radiation belts, he had developed a form of leukemia. Sasquatch battled the rampaging Skrull but was ultimately forced to return him to his discorporate state and return it to the Van Allen Radiation Belts once more.During his time of incapacitation, the Skrulls lost their natural shape-changing powers and their empire was decimated into factions. (In fact, K'lrt's wife R'Kll was the assassin who killed the Emperor Dorrek.) One of the self-proclaimed \"Empresses\" of the empire's remnants, S'byll, tricked the Silver Surfer into using his power cosmic to re-form the Super-Skrull in order that they may aid her fleet in battle against the Badoon. This act threatened to escalate a new Kree-Skrull war, and the Super-Skrull convinced the Surfer to use his power cosmic to help him catalyze the latent shape-changing powers in S'byll's genetic structure. The two were able to awake the full power of a shape-changing Skrull in S'byll as well as to give her the ability to rekindle the shape-changing powers of others of her race. S'byll was sure that this ability would grant her support for her Empress-ship and allow the Skrulls to defy the Kree's genocidal efforts against the Skrulls. K'lrt stayed on as S'byll's champion, enjoying unparalleled fame as a great hero of the Skrull worlds.Shortly after, the enigmatic Stranger appeared and tried to add S'byll to his collection. The attempt was foiled when the pirate Captain Reptyl arrived on the scene and traded his entire pirate crew for her. In return for her freedom, he asked to become a privateer in her cause, and S'byll, happy to find a new ally, accepted his service. Enraged, K'lrt dueled with Captain Reptyl for the honor of being S'byll's consort and the Warlord of the Skrulls. K'lrt lost, and was believed slain, left to drift in space. In fact, the Super-Skrull did not die, but managed to find his way back to Earth where he decided to remain hidden until he could receive orders from a legitimate heir to Emperor Dorrek. At one point, the Super-Skrull duplicated the likeness of Danny Rand, a.k.a. Iron Fist, fully assuming his identity in order to use the Rand Corporation and gain economic control of the Antarctic paradise known as the Savage Land. This conflicted with the plans of another company, Oracle Inc., owned by Prince Namor the Sub-Mariner. Namor, Namorita, and Misty Knight confronted Super-Skrull, who, with his plans ruined, abandoned Rand's identity and fled. (The assembled heroes set out on a search for the real Danny Rand, eventually freeing him from the alien H'ylthri.)During his time of hiding, he appropriated the identity of Lon Zelig, a master of disguise, and he quickly gained renown in Hollywood. Eventually, he was targeted for assassination by other Skrulls, who believed K'lrt to be a living representative of an old regime and a dangerous potential menace. The Skrulls tricked the Human Torch into fighting alongside them, but K'lrt defeated the attempt and revealed the truth to the Human Torch before disappearing once more.The Super-Skrull was impressed into serving a Skrull faction led by the Intelligentsia, a Skrull version of the Kree's Supreme Intelligence. Although he apparently bristled at her leadership, he followed one of her orders to kidnap Kelly, a girl on Earth who held a special connection to the nexus of all realities. This first brought him into conflict with Captain Marvel over her fate, but Kl'rt kidnapped her, rather than killing her as was ordered, and returned to Intelligentsia with her. Hoping to stage a coup, with the girl's powers, the Super-Skrull again fought off Captain Marvel, but Kelly instead turned her power on herself, negating her abilities, rendering the whole thing moot. The Super-Skrull was never seen working with the Intelligentsia again. By this time, S'byll had died when her Skrull throneworld was destroyed by Devos. The Super-Skrull joined a faction of the empire who were seeking an heir to Emperor Dorrek, believing him to be found in Teddy Altman, Hulkling. Teddy was the product of the union between the original Captain Marvel and Princess Anelle, during the time of Marvel's abduction by the Super-Skrull many years ago. Despite the interference of Teddy's friends, the Young Avengers, the Super-Skrull revealed the truth of Teddy's origin and killed his \"mother\", a Skrull sent by the Princess to raise her son on Earth. Teddy was forced to acknowledge his heritage to both the Kree and the Skrulls, dividing his time between the two empires. In fact, unknown to all but the Young Avengers, Kl'rt impersonated Hulking, taking his place and his role in order to spy on the two races. Shortly thereafter, however, the Skrull empire fell victim to the Annihilation Wave, although the Super-Skrull, for all his power, seemed helpless to stave its course. Believing his son to be residing on a planet in its path, Kl'rt and a Skrullian engineer R'kin hoped to find the secret to stop the Annihilation Wave and its weapon, the Harvester of Sorrows, from its source: the Negative Zone. Rallying troops from a penal colony within the Zone, the Super-Skrull was instead betrayed by R'kin, who held the Super-Skrull responsible for the death of his father. Imprisoned, Kl'rt used his hypnosis to force R'kin to free him and fellow prisoner Praxagora, the last of a robotic race. The Super-Skrull urged Praxagora to escape, but not before absorbing enough of her energy to make one final stand from within. Kl'rt sacrificed himself destroyed the Harvester, once more proving himself to be a hero for his people. Super-Skrull's body was later revealed to be in possession of Praxagora who had survived the explosion and joined the United Front against Annihilus. In one of the battles against Annihilus' forces Super-Skrull's body was reanimated by compination of Firelord's and Ravenous' powers as they unleashed them in the mist of the battle. He stayed with the United Front until the end of the war.Recently, Ronan called both Kl'rt and Praxagora to Kree space in order to give them awards for their heroics during the war. However the Kree Empire was already infected by the Phalanx. Somehow the Phalanx had captured both Kl'rt and Praxagora and infected them with their techno-organic virus, causing them to become servants of the Phalanx. However, due to the intervention of the being known as Wraith both Kl'rt and Praxagora were freed from the Phalanx's control.",

      "biography": "Superia was a scientific genius who followed a path of ultra-feminism. Many of the foundations for her point of view came about after she constructed a time-probe and sent it into the 23rd century, where it obtained a history book. From the book, Superia learned of the future of Femizonia, a powerful nation state ruled by the women of that future, and of how the men of that era were treated as inferiors. Her research indicated that she was the ancestor of Thundra, the Femizons' most famous warrior and ruler. Although the Femizons' world was an alternate future (the dimension of Earth-715), Superia became determined to bring about the nation of Femizonia within her lifetime.Superia first came to the world's attention when she sponsored a pleasure cruise for female super-criminals which would transport them to the island of Femizonia. Superia called the women who arrived her Femizons, and intended to launch missiles from Femizonia which would infect the Earth with a biological weapon designed to sterilize all females. Surrounded by the island's protective dome, Superia and her followers would be unaffected, thereby granting them a powerful bargaining position over the rest of the planet-- Superia planned to force nations to submit to her, or face extinction; however, Captain America had tracked the cruise ship as he pursued his girlfriend Diamondback, and the mercenary Paladin accompanied him. Captain America was unable to prevent the missiles from launching, but he tricked Superia into fighting him near the dome so that it would be damaged, forcing her to destroy the missiles herself.\nAfter this, Superia operated with a smaller team of Femizons used mainly as bodyguards. She journeyed to A.I.M. Island (Boca Caliente) during one of A.I.M.'s weapon expos and attempted to kill their CEO Alessandro Brannex and claim their resources for herself, but Brannex proved to be the Super-Adaptoid, and ordered her death. However, Captain America was on A.I.M. Island, helping Diamondback track Snapdragon, who had nearly drowned Diamondback during the Femizons' cruise. Captain America mistook Superia for Diamondback, and wound up saving her from MODAM. Superia demonstrated no gratitude to her opponent. During these events, a vengeful Diamondback drowned Snapdragon.Posing as university professor Deidre Wentworth at Hayden College, Superia selected the bookworm-like student Cathy Webster as the recipient of a process that enhanced her physical prowess. Cathy became the patriotic heroine Free Spirit, but when she found that Superia's treatment included an irrational hatred of men, she turned on her. Free Spirit tracked Superia to Castle Zemo in Malpaso, Mexico, where Superia was conferring with Baroness (Heike Zemo). Captain America and Diamondback had also pursued Zemo, and when Superia learned that Captain America was dying from the degeneration of his super-soldier serum, she offered to develop a cure if Diamondback would complete Snapdragon's unfinished contract. Diamondback agreed, and became the new Snapdragon.\nSuperia and Snapdragon invaded A.I.M. Island as the Super-Adaptoid attempted to create a new Cosmic Cube there, attracting attention from the Avengers. Superia encountered a paralyzed Captain America and offered him a sample of her cure. Captain America refused, and the cure was claimed by the Red Skull, who was suffering from the same degenerative effects, and he apparently killed Superia to prevent her from developing more samples.",

      "biography": "Fritz von Meyer was once a Nazi scientist, the details of which remain unrevealed, although it is known he had access to looted gold from countless European capitals to fund his research. Von Meyer fled Germany at the end of World War II to settle in South America. A world expert on toxic poisons and apiculture (bee keeping,) he continued his research on breeding patterns of killer bees in comparative peace deep in the jungles.One day, he found a hive unlike any he had ever seen-- the bees exhibited no fear, an unusual passivity, and a highly developed intelligence. Believing that a nearby meteorite bombardment had somehow mutated the bees with radiation, von Meyer built a device that he hoped would reawaken the bees' killer instincts so that they could serve him. However, von Meyer had erred, so that, while the bees were no longer passive, they were not in his control. They began to swarm over von Meyer, killing him. In the midst of his death throes, his consciousness shredded, dissipating into the swarm of bees. Thus, von Meyer became an aggregate being, a living embodiment of the swarm, with his own scientific mind added to the mutant intelligence of the multitude of bees. Von Meyer claims to have used his powers to conquer, and at some point he must have developed giant mechanical bees that obey his commands.Shortly afterward, the international police agency Interpol, in its quest to bring war criminals to justice, managed to track down von Meyer. One agent somehow managed to capture the queen bee of von Meyer's swarm, encasing it in amber and fleeing to the United States. Von Meyer, calling himself Swarm, followed, killing the agent who was attempting to flee on a ship but failing to recover the briefcase that held the trapped queen. At the same time, the Champions were seeing off a friend of their member, Black Widow. They interrupted Swarm's attack, discovered the murder, and took the briefcase, unaware of its purpose. Swarm soon confronted the team directly, and during the attack, managed to free the queen. The queen was free to complete its mutation, begun earlier by von Meyer, and grew to gigantic size. The fight ended when the Champion Hercules, using his superhuman strength, threw the gigantic queen miles away. The bees of von Meyer's body were pulled away, following the queen, and left von Meyer as nothing but a skeleton.Von Meyer's skeleton was sent to New York's Empire State University biophysics department for further study. When the scientist started performing radiation tests on the skeleton, a queen bee that happened to be in the skull instantly began breeding millions of bees. (It is unclear whether this was the original queen bee somehow shrunken or a different one entirely.) Within moments, the entity of Swarm was reborn. Swarm decided to kill the scientist and launch a reign of terror on the campus. The scientist was rescued by Spider-Man, whose secret identity of Peter Parker had began work in the department as a teaching assistant, and Swarm turned his attention on Spider-Man, claiming that \"spiders and bees are natural deadly enemies.\" Spider-Man was saved only by smashing into nearby chemicals that happened to be some manner of insect repellant.Swarm immediately launched an attack on the city, hoping to cleanse the world of humankind. He also hoped to allow his queen bee to mutate and grow, and he began constructing a gigantic hive in the middle of the campus for this purpose. Parker learned from his fellow teaching assistants that they created more of the experimental insect repellant that saved Spider-Man's life. Pouring the chemicals on his costume and combining it with his web-fluid, Spider-Man once more confronted Swarm. The repellant caused the bees intense pain, and in their maddened state, they turned against each other. This also happened to the now-gigantic queen bee, whose hive refused to obey Swarm's commands and fled. Once more, von Meyer was reduced to nothing but a skeleton.Somehow, Swarm's intelligence survived, presumably due to the fact that he no longer needed the human skeleton upon which to manifest. Years later, experiments on a supercollider project at the Rand-Meachum laboratories in Houston, Texas, began disrupting the migratory patterns of various insects and causing Swarm severe distress. Vowing revenge, Swarm used various insects under his control to surreptitiously sabotage the project. The insect attacks alerted the attention of a government watchdog group. The leader of the group contacted his old friend, Doctor Druid, for help. Druid, in turn, manipulated events so that Doctor Henry Pym (in his Giant-Man identity) would unknowingly join his team of \"Secret Defenders\" to investigate.Doctor Druid and his regular allies confronted Swarm, who, frustrated on being discovered, hoped to use the destructive power of the supercollider to render all technology in the world useless, thus paving the way for insect life to become the rightful dominant lifeform on the planet. Druid psychically induced Archangel and Iceman (former members of the Champions) to converge on the site, and the battle was joined on multiple fronts. Ultimately, Druid was able to convince Swarm that if he truly believed that humankind would eventually destroy itself anyway, he shouldn't risk attracting the enmity of the human race and should simply wait for the inevitable destruction. Swarm agreed and fled. In the meantime, the other heroes were able to use their powers to stop the supercollider from overloading.When Onslaught was destroyed by Earth's heroes, the telepathic bond between von Meyer and his mutant bee colony was damaged. Swarm returned to New York, the place of Onslaught's destruction, to re-establish his psychic link or risk becoming discorporate again. He took over the Institute of Seismoharmonic Research to force its research team to adjust his body's vibratory field to restore him to full power, as bees fly by moving their wings so fast that they create a vibratory current they can ride on. In the meantime, a cloud of bees began forming over the city, attacking people and causing mayhem. This drew the attention of Spider-Man (Ben Reilly).Swarm's bees seemed to recognize and be afraid of Spider-Man, despite the fact that it was a different person in the costume, thus allowing the hero to enter the Institute unmolested and form a plan with the scientists. Spider-Man adjusted the equipment, so that, instead of allowing Swarm to pull together his bees, the bees' ability to fly was negated. Spider-Man easily captured the queen bee, professing to prevent Swarm from posing any future threat.When the cabal of villains known as the Pride was defeated by their children, it left Los Angeles and the West Coast with a power vacuum in its criminal community. Notified by its drones, Swarm appeared in Hollywood, claiming his rule over the city. He was opposed by the Runaways and taken down by their newest member, Victor Mancha, who used his powers to disrupt the electrical impulses that Swarm’s bees used for communication.",

He makes quite a bundle training and distributing hired help to the Super-Villain trade, and when he’s not a hired combat instructor, he’s a covert operative for government agencies.\n\nImitation Game\n\nThe man who would become the Taskmaster is born a prodigious savant of mnemonic talents in the Bronx, a borough of New York City to an unidentified mother. He discovers his unusual abilities in childhood when, after watching a cowboy television program, he finds he can duplicate the actor’s rope tricks. Growing to understand his ability, he sees a man perform a difficult backwards leap from a diving board; he duplicates the dive, but nearly drowns because he does not know how to swim. Afterwards, his mother calls in psychiatrists who study his ability, terming it “photographic reflexes.” He revels in his abilities in his youth, even becoming his high school football team’s quarterback after watching one professional football game. After graduating high school he contemplates becoming a Super Hero, but decides crime would be more lucrative.\n\nHe studies television footage of various Super Heroes and their techniques to expand his combat repertoire. Initially committing several grand larcenies, he decides it smarter to avoid risking direct confrontation with law enforcers, and uses his stolen capital to establish himself as a combat trainer for aspiring professional criminals—specializing in producing henchmen for Super Villains and criminal organizations around the world; one unidentified early graduate of his criminal academy would become espionage legend Spymaster. Designing a costume, he takes the moniker “Taskmaster”.\n\nTaskmaster then sets up the Solomon Institute for the Criminally Insane as a front for one of his training academies, but its administrator Dr. Parnell Solomon develops heart problems and has Taskmaster’s science staff grow him a clone, Selbe, to harvest for a replacement organ; though Selbe escapes and runs to the Avengers, who expose the operation with the aid of their ally Scott Lang, AKA Ant-Man. Taskmaster single-handedly holds his own against both Steve Rogers, AKA Captain America, and Tony Stark, AKA Iron Man in combat; while tempted to test himself against all the Avengers, he realizes that he would not be able to run his business from jail and ends up fleeing after the unfamiliar abilities of obscure robotic Avengers associate, Jocasta, throws him off balance\n\nPhotographic Reflexes\n\nTaskmaster’s “photographic reflexes” enable him to watch another person’s physical movements and duplicate them without practice, no matter how unique or complex these movements might be. He cannot duplicate feats that require superhuman strength or other superhuman attributes. By reviewing recordings of movements periodically, Taskmaster can retain duplicated moves indefinitely. When facing an opponent he has already studied, Taskmaster can virtually predict his enemy’s attacks, and he can see through disguises of anyone he has studied by recognizing their unique body language, making it virtually impossible to conceal any identity from him. He can also use his ability to mimic the voices of others and to learn new languages. For a time, Taskmaster could double his speed and reflexes to the point where he could grab bullets mid-flight, but he could only maintain his heightened state for minutes before risking permanent physical damage to his body. Taskmaster also briefly gained the power to duplicate others’ superhuman abilities by watching them use their powers. These latter two powers, gained during Albino’s experiments, have apparently worn off.\n\nA naturally gifted athlete, Taskmaster has trained himself into superb physical condition. His physical skills include multiple martial arts (modern and historical styles), boxing, wrestling, swordsmanship, archery, marksmanship, juggling, gymnastics, aerial acrobatics and sleight of hand. He is also trained in meditation, including a technique that enables him to conserve breath. Taskmaster has duplicated the fighting abilities of countless martial artists through watching movies, as well as the combat styles of Super Heroes and Super Villains including Ant-Man, Dane Whitman, AKA Black Knight, Boomerang, Lester, AKA Bullseye, Captain America, Shen Kuei, AKA Cat, Constrictor, Daredevil, Deadpool, Elektra, Hawkeye, Danny Rand, AKA Iron Fist, Iron Man, Moon Knight, Oddball, Puma, Punisher, Silver Samurai, Spider-Man, Thor, Logan/James Howlett, AKA Wolverine, Zaran and many others. His abilities also enable him to cheat at gambling, excel at professional sports and duplicate cooking techniques.\n\nTaskmaster has access to a massive arsenal of weaponry which his hired scientists customize according to his needs, generally modeled after those whose abilities he mimics, though usually not as high quality as the originals. He often carries a concave, disc-shaped shield, 2.5 feet in diameter and weighing twelve pounds composed of a metal alloy that he wields in Captain America’s style. The shield serves as both protection and a hurling weapon, its unique composition allowing it to move through the air with minimal wind resistance and rebound from solid objects with little loss of angular momentum; a billy club that he wields in Daredevil’s style; a pair of .45 colt automatic handguns modeled after the Punisher’s; wrist web shooters based on Spider-Man’s; a bow and several trick arrows based on Hawkeye’s gear; Pym Particles used in Ant-Man’s fashion; various European and Japanese swords modeled after Black Knight and Silver Samurai; and throwing darts, knives, sais, a lariat, grenade launchers, sniper rifles, crossbows, and a variety of explosives. His costume is composed of lightweight bulletproof Kevlar and has a utility belt for holding weaponry and devices, including a communications device. An image inducer concealed on his person enables him to project a hologram of himself in civilian clothes, as well as disguise his face and impersonate others. It is not known how long Taskmaster has been using the image inducer, or what his present facial features look like. He can also rig the inducer to project a hologram of himself as a decoy to confuse opponents. Taskmaster’s mercenary costume is composed of lightweight high- tenacity ballistic aramid fiber plates and mask and equipped with a Kevlar mesh lining. Taskmaster briefly used an energy generator housed in his glove that could transform into an energy shield equipped to absorb and redirect kinetic energy, emit energy webbing, form into claws based on Wolverine, and other weapons.\n\nTaskmaster briefly employed a group of androids modeled after various Avengers, but all have been destroyed.\n\nAfter he injects himself with a Nazi-made Super-Soldier Serum imitation, his brain instantaneously absorbs knowledge and retains it, but also impacts his long- and short-term memory negatively.\n\nInstructive Enemies\n\nSince Taskmaster makes a name for himself as a career criminal that trains villains in the art of heroic moves, he bases all his teachings off of watching Super Heroes like Steve Rogers, AKA Captain America, Matt Murdoch, AKA Daredevil and Peter Parker, AKA Spider-Man, and the Avengers to name a few. While their movements are informative, Taskmaster still battles the vigilantes when he has to do so.\n\nCriminal and Not-So-Criminal Colleagues\n\nWhile Taskmaster goes in and out of training criminal operatives to become Super Villains, he joins with others typically as a hired blunt instrument. He joins the Frightful Four to go up against the heroic Fantastic Four but his membership is short-lived.\n\nAfter recruiting criminals for Black Abbott, Taskmaster is arrested, but for a reduced sentence he is instructed to train others in the fighting style of Captain America—through the manipulative actions of Joann Shmidt, AKA Red Skull so that he could defeat the trainees in his own battle simulations. Red Skull also coordinated Taskmaster’s escape and resumed operations.\n\nTaskmaster hires a mutagenics specialist, Augusta Seger, AKA Albino, to help him duplicate the Avengers’ members superpowers. He pits his recruits against the Avengers to study them and with the specialists help, he duplicates some of them but only briefly before the Super Heroes defeated him.\n\nTaskmaster also assists Agency X after the Four Winds crime family clashes over the agency’s property. He teams up with Agent X, Inez Temple, AKA Outlaw, Wade Wilson, AKA Deadpool, Deadpool’s assistant Sandi Brandenberg, former love interest of Taskmaster, and the East Wind against Taskmaster’s former ally Black Swan who double-crosses them. Later, Taskmaster and Deadpool go up against one another with the latter defeating the former, but when money’s involved, Taskmaster will accept payment to help Deadpool.\n\nWhen Taskmaster is arrested, the government assigns him to the Thunderbolts for a time. After receiving a full pardon from S.H.I.E.L.D., Taskmaster is recruited to the 50-State Initiative as a drill instructor where he teaches MVP clones Spider-Man’s moves. He is later recruited into the Shadow Initiative by Norman Osborn, AKA Green Goblin, where he is promoted to lead alongside Parker Robbins, AKA Hood.\n\nWhile working with S.H.I.E.L.D., he injects himself with serum that enhances his knowledge absorption and retention but also causes memory loss so he doesn’t realize he works for the government agency and thinks himself a Super Villain; he also doesn’t remember that he marries, Mercedes Merced a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and his handler.\n\nThe Taskmaster’s Criminal Record\n\nAlong with skull-crushing Canadian mercenary Tyrell Farsa and telepathic mind-altering assassin Black Swan, Taskmaster was hired to kill a militant group trying to maintain control of an airstrip in the third world country Zaire. Upon completion of the mission, Farsa disrespected the cultured Black Swan by using his silk handkerchief; Taskmaster assisted Farsa when the Swan attacked, but Swan defeated them both.\n\nTaskmaster briefly joined the criminal Frightful Four team with Bentley Wittman, AKA Wizard, Wade Wilson, AKA Deadpool and Constrictor to battle the Fantastic Four, but when Deadpool went after Franklin Richards, the rest of the team left him to face the FF alone. This Frightful Four grouping broke up soon after. Afterwards, Taskmaster went back to training others, including Brock Rumlow (later Crossbones), Rachel Leighton (later Diamondback) and Sheoke Sanada (later Snapdragon).&gt;\n\nSpider-Man and Ant-Man soon discovered another of Taskmaster’s schools and battled him, preventing his theft of nuclear material. Clint Barton, AKA Hawkeye and Ant-Man later exposed and halted Taskmaster’s use of the Carson Carnival of Traveling Wonders as a mobile recruiting center, and Spider-Man and Jack Monroe, AKA Nomad disrupted his recruiting street gangs for Black Abbott. After battling Benjamin Grimm, AKA The Thing, and Vance Astrovik (later Justice) in Ohio, Taskmaster was captured by FBI agents and taken into custody.\n\nUnder the guise of John Smith, the Red Skull manipulated the Commission on Superhuman Activities (CSA) head Douglas Rockwell into reducing Taskmaster’s sentence in return for training John Walker (later USAgent) as the next Captain America using Rogers’ fighting style. After completing this assignment, the Red Skull arranged for the Taskmaster’s escape so he could resume his operations. The Skull funded Taskmaster’s activities, and Taskmaster tutored multiple students in Captain America’s fighting style so that the Red Skull could kill them in his own training exercises.\n\nLater, Taskmaster set up a new academy in a Brooklyn, New York mausoleum where he battled Spider-Man, who believed Taskmaster had kidnapped his wife, Mary Jane Watson-Parker; using a magnesium flare, Taskmaster escaped both capture and Spider-Man’s wrath. When the Spymaster was believed slain, unscrupulous industrialist Justin Hammer hired Taskmaster to train a replacement; Taskmaster’s lethal elimination tests whittled the candidates down to one winner, Nathan Lemon.\n\nTaskmaster briefly put his operations on hold when a faction of the Hand ninja cult created an assassination contest between Taskmaster and Tombstone to see who could kill the most targets. This led to a battle with vigilantes Matt Murdock, AKA Daredevil, and Frank Castle, AKA Punisher; Taskmaster wound up with the Punisher’s knife in his stomach and spent some time in a prison hospital recuperating.\n\nTaskmaster later resumed operations for the Red Skull and attended an assemblage of Red Skull’s division chiefs, which included Watchdog Prime, Sin, Arnim Zola, Minister Blood, Curtiss Jackson, AKA Power Broker, a Scourge of the Underworld, the Resistants’ Byron Calleym AKA Crucible, the Secret Empire’s Number Seven and Hydra’s Baron Strucker. When Crossbones took a leave of absence from the Skeleton Crew, Mother Night, claiming Red Skull requested the training, had Taskmaster train Cutthroat as his replacement. Hired by the Red Skull to kill Spider-Man, Taskmaster took this opportunity to try out new graduates Michael Bingham, AKA Blood Spider, Timothy Karlskin, AKA Death-Shield, and Joe Emberlin, AKA Jagged Bow, whom he had trained to be criminal versions of Spider-Man, Captain America and Hawkeye. Spider-Man and the anti-terrorist James Bourne, AKA Solo, defeated the trio as Taskmaster escaped capture once again.\n\nAfterwards, Taskmaster battled the Sam Wilson, AKA Falcon, when he helped Tyrone McQuaid escape from one of Taskmaster’s academies; attended Robert Brasman’s, AKA Brass Bishop criminal auction in Canada, where he fought Spider-Man and Alpha Flight; crossed swords with Daredevil, Wilbur Day, AKA Stilt-Man, Tatterdemalion and the Wild Boys over restaurant grease believed to be worth half a million dollars; took on Spider-Man and Felicia Hardy, AKA Black Cat, during a bank robbery training session; and testified as a character witness when super-criminal Peter Petruski, AKA Trapster tried to sue the criminal mechanic Tinkerer for faulty equipment. When the amnesiac Earth-93060 (“Ultraverse”) heroine Jennifer Pearson, AKA Siren, was teleported into one of the academies, Taskmaster gave her an audition to join and eventually developed a relationship with her. Taskmaster also discovered that Diamondback, who had joined under the ruse that she desired more training, had double-crossed him by planting explosives around the academy. When the young mutant Kyi, AKA Jolt, who desired to join Taskmaster’s academy, accidentally triggered one of the explosive devices, Taskmaster had Jolt open a portal large enough for Siren, Jolt and himself to escape. During the journey through the portal, Siren was sent back to her own dimension, Jolt teleported to an unrevealed location, and Taskmaster was pulled forward in time by a dimension-hopping madman as one of many criminals pitted against the Avengers and a distant cosmos’ heroes before being returned to his own time.\n\nTaskmaster later kidnapped computer hacker and arms supplier Jack Hammer, AKA Weasel, to retain his services, but after Deadpool defeated Taskmaster, Weasel declined this offer, though he offered his services in the future. Seeking his own death, the mysterious Architect, last of the Shining Ones, arranged a contest involving Mark Scarlotti, AKA Blacklash, Boomerang, the mercenary Bullet, Carl Burbank, AKA Bushwacker, Elektra Natchios, AKA Elektra, Fatale, Alfonso Lopez, AKA Machete, Douglas Scott, AKA Razor-Fist, Shatterhead and Maximillian Zaran to see which was fit to kill him. During the contest, Taskmaster overpowered Elektra using Daredevil’s fighting style, but she later returned and defeated him.\n\nLater, Taskmaster hired Augusta Seger, AKA Albino, a world renowned biologist specializing in mutagenics (the study of effects of human mutations), to help him duplicate superpowers. Taskmaster employed Batroc (Georges Batroc), Machete (Ferdinand Lopez, Alfonso’s brother), Zaran and Elton Healey, AKA Oddball, along with androids of Henry McCoy, AKA Beast, T’Challa, AKA Black Panther, Captain America, Hank Pym, AKA Goliath, Bruce Banner, AKA Hulk, Iron Man, Quicksilver, Namor, Thor Odinson, and “Victor Shade”, AKA Vision, to analyze the Avengers’ powers, pitting his operatives against several Avengers members.\n\nTaskmaster briefly duplicated the powers of the Avengers Firestar and Justice using Albino’s technology, but he was defeated by the duo and Hawkeye, and his new powers apparently faded. When the Avengers began using proactive tactics, they targeted Taskmaster’s numerous academies, briefly putting a stop to his operations and denying criminals, terrorists and super villains a valuable resource; however, Taskmaster continued to elude them. Taskmaster briefly employed Constrictor, Copycat (disguised as Titania/Mary MacPherran) and the “Deadpool Interns”—Deadair, Deadend, and Deadweight—to seek revenge on Deadpool. Afterwards, Taskmaster entered Madripoor’s Bloodsport tournament to help boost his price in training super villains, but was defeated by the telepathic mass murderer Mr. X.\n\nTrying to make up for the lost profit, Taskmaster returned to mercenary assignments and accepted Sunset Bain’s commission to sabotage a semiconductor being built by Tony Stark. Taskmaster completed the assignment, but when Bain tried to have him killed, he tricked Triads gangs into attacking her, ultimately harming her organization enough that she finally called off her hit. During this time he became involved with Sandi Brandenberg, but eventually broke it off; while they remained friends, he found it difficult to give her up. When Deadpool employed Sandi as a secretary, she brought Taskmaster in to aid him against the Black Swan. Taskmaster helped set Deadpool on the path to facing the Black Swan, and he also found time to execute Sandi’s then-boyfriend when he learned he had beaten her. When Deadpool seemingly died in an explosion battling the Black Swan, Sandi believed the amnesiac Alex Hayden, AKA Agent X, was Deadpool, and Taskmaster trained him on Sandi’s behalf, then aided Agent X and Outlaw, when the Four Winds crime family clashed over Agency X’s property. Discovering Agent X was an amalgam of Black Swan's agent Nijo, Deadpool, and Black Swan, they arranged to restore themselves to normal, but when the Black Swan tried to double-cross them, Taskmaster, Outlaw, Sandi and the Eastern Wind helped Deadpool and Agent X defeat Black Swan.\n\nThe Committee, a cartel of financiers ostensibly dedicated to reviving the US economy through illegal activities, hired Taskmaster to assassinate vigilante Marc Spector, AKA Moon Knight, who had been instrumental in defeating them in the past, after their agent the Profile determined that Moon Knight was without friends or determination. Taskmaster found that this was not the case, as Moon Knight’s friends came to aid him, and he tried to get out of his Committee deal, but Moon Knight pursued him to the Committee’s base and defeated him in battle.\n\nArrested and imprisoned under unrevealed circumstances, Taskmaster was recruited for government service by the CSA during the “Civil War” between US super heroes following passage of the Superhuman Registration Act (SHRA). Assigned to the Thunderbolts, Taskmaster joined other superhuman criminals in attacking Captain America’s anti-SHRA forces. Following Cap’s surrender, Taskmaster was rearrested, but before being transferred to the Negative Zone prison 42 he was quickly released by Deadpool, who had hoped to re-establish his reputation by defeating Taskmaster in a public display of combat.\n\nS.H.I.E.L.D. Commander Maria Hill gave Taskmaster a full presidential pardon after he helped test the defenses of a S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. The CSA then recruited him to train three clones of accidentally slain 50-State Initiative cadet Michael Van Patrick, AKA MVP, in Spider-Man’s fighting style so they could become Initiative agents as the Scarlet Spiders. Afterwards, Taskmaster was assigned to Camp Hammond as the Fifty State Initiative recruit drill instructor, where his many students included Ant-Man’s successor, Eric O’Grady, Bengal, Abigail Boylen, AKA Cloud Nine, Z’reg, AKA Crusader, Tako Shamara, AKA Dragon Lord, Geiger, Melati Kusama, AKA Komodo, Melee, Rage, Red 9, Speedball (Earth-8101’s simian Robbie Baldwin), Cassie Lang, AKA Stature, Triathlon and Ultragirl.\n\nLater, super-criminals Russ Broxtel, AKA Firebrand, Klaus Voorhees, AKA King Cobra, Brendan Doyle, AKA Mauler, and Calvin Zabo, AKA Mr. Hyde made a failed attempt to kill the Taskmaster for joining the Initiative. When inept Initiative recruit Butterball was sent home, Taskmaster and Constrictor felt sorry for him and arranged a photo where it looked like Butterball defeated the pair in combat.\n\nAfter the Skrull invasion, the Initiative fell under the control of corrupt, unstable tycoon Norman Osborn, AKA Green Goblin; he restructured it, assigned Taskmaster to the Shadow Initiative along with Bengal, Constrictor, Komodo and Mutant Zero, Mary Walker/Typhoid Mary, and sent them to Madripoor to apprehend Initiative defector Roger Brokeridge, AKA Hardball, who had joined Hydra. Completing the mission, the Shadow Initiative returned home to find Osborn replacing Camp Hammond with his new Camp HAMMER. Osborn placed Taskmaster and supernatural crime boss Parker Robbins, AKA Hood, in charge of the Initiative and began welcoming many active super criminals into the organization. These new recruits were supposedly reformed, but Osborn would allow them to continue their criminal careers in secret as long as they posed as heroes in public, so Taskmaster and Hood trained many of these criminals in how to fake heroic behavior. Meanwhile, Taskmaster secretly helped Deadpool battle Osborn’s Thunderbolts as payback for Deadpool previously having helped Taskmaster escape prison.\n\nAfter a rumor starts that Taskmaster turned traitor, working for Captain America, a bounty is placed on his head by The Org, a secret criminal organization. Hordes of villains, including his psychopathic students go after him. Suffering from memory loss, and trying to discern who framed him, Taskmaster is required to look deep into his past at who he really is. Teaming up with involuntary sidekick/love interest Mercedes Merced, their hunt for the truth meant engaging Don of the Dead and a town full of Adolf Hitlers. A fight breaks out and Taskmaster with Mercedes ended up in an underground tunnel that led to a room all too familiar to Taskmaster. He recalled the last time he was there, while working under S.H.I.E.L.D. he discovered Primer, a Super-Soldier Serum imitation, and with his desire to be the best, he injected himself with it--which caused his lapse in memory. As his memories flooded back, he recognized Mercedes voice and shot her only to discover that she was and still is his wife&lt;.\n\nWhen the Secret Avengers sought Mercedes, a former L-3 S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, it is revealed that she and him together run The Org, which is technically a S.H.I.E.L.D. front. But his memory issue returned and he left Mercedes after defeating the Red Shirt, a villain who forged the bounty and sought the Org’s true identities. Mercedes escaped as well but not before leaving an audio recording for Captain America explaining that her operation with Taskmaster had a 20 percent success rate according to S.H.I.E.L.D.’s director, and that every time Taskmaster loses his memory, he thinks he’s a villain.",

      "biography": "The complete history of Tenebrous is unknown. He has existed in this universe since its infancy. He is a proemial being. It is said that he prepared what existed for what is to come, by eliminating early lifeforms such as the Chaos Mites. It is documented that ages ago he was known and feared as Tenebrous of the Darkness. Time has erased nearly all of his evil. In an early battle of the Gods Tenebrous and the female proemial God Aegis were among the only remaining survivors of a brutal battle with Galactus. They were imprisoned in the prison planetoid known as the Kyln by the World Devourer Galactus. The Kyln is located at the edge of the universe in a sector known as the Crunch Cascade. They remained locked in there for centuries. Unfortunately it was through the Crunch Cascade that the Annihilation Wave started its invasion of the positive universe. The wave did irreparable damage to the Kyln, and Aegis and Tenebrous were released back into the living universe once more, adding further fuel to the chaos that was engulfing all life. There were two other former powerful inmates freed from the Kyln, Kosmos the Maker formerly the Beyonder, and the Fallen One first Herald of Galactus. Tenebrous captured and drained the Fallen One of his power, leaving him as a lifeless husk. Thanos of Titan came to the rescue of the Fallen One. Thanos brokered a deal with Tenebrous for the return of the Fallen One.  Tenebrous and Aegis confronted Galactus and his newly restored Herald the Silver Surfer in battle. Galactus and the Silver Surfer were easily defeated and left for Thanos to strip them of the Power Cosmic. Thanos who had struck an alliance with Annihilus of the Negative Zone. Thanos worked diligently to remove the Power Cosmic. Tenebrous and Aegis disappeared into the cosmos. They later returned to the ruins of the Kyln hoping to find the other Proemial Gods, which could have also been prisoners there. To their disappointment they found the fallen body of Antiphon the Overseer. He had apparently fell victim to the destruction of the Kyln. The Silver Surfer who had escaped captivity tracked down the two Gods. He defeated them by using the powers of the Crunch to destroy them once and for all.",

      "biography": "Tyros was once the dictator of the city Lanlak on the planet Birj, where his superhuman ability to command rocks and earth enabled him to overcome all resistance. His rule of Lanlak came to an end when he was sought by the world-devouring Galactus to serve as his newest Herald. Galactus sent his sometimes-adversaries of the Fantastic Four to apprehend Tyros and bring him to receive the Power Cosmic. Tyros resisted them, but to no avail. Galactus made Tyros his new Herald Terrax, and the power cosmic magnified his abilities, making him far more powerful than he had been before.Terrax proved to be the most troublesome Herald to ever serve Galactus. Although he led to devour many worlds, Terrax wished to use his powers for personal gain, and only fear of his master kept him in line. He once fled Galactus' service to set up his own empire, but Galactus empowered the Earth woman, Alison Blaire (also known as Dazzler) to retrieve him. Finally, Terrax kept Galactus from feeding long enough that his energies dwindled, and he finally led him to Earth in the hopes that the Fantastic Four would help him slay his master. Galactus withdrew the power Cosmic from Terrax to replenish his own spent energies, and left Terrax stranded on Earth.The dictator Victor von Doom was able to restore some of Terrax's power to him to use against the Fantastic Four, but in battle with the Silver Surfer, Terrax was consumed by the Power Cosmic and killed. His body later regenerated itself on Earth, but the Surfer exiled Terrax to an uninhabited world.Terrax was released from his exile to aid fellow Heralds Firelord, Nova, the android Air walker and the Silver Surfer against Morg. Terrax slew Morg with his own axe, which he kept as spoils of the battle, Morg was later resurrected.As the Annihilation Wave began its search for Galactus' Heralds so that Annihilus could study the Power Cosmic, Terrax was one of the first to be captured by the Seekers of Annihilus and taken into custody. Terrax was eventually freed from his captors' control and exacted his revenge upon them. Afterwards, he, Paibok, the Power Skrull and the Infant Terrible journeyed to a world inhabited by Centaurians and saved them from the deadly Space Parasite. After cleaving the monster in two, Terrax left the others planet side claiming it was time for him to show the universe why Terrax, the Tamer should be feared once more.Recently, the Red Hulk recruited Terrax, along with Tiger Shark and Baron Mordo, to become part of the Offenders to take part in a death duel against the Hulk and the Defenders. Terrax was matched up against the Silver Surfer in the Microverse, but neither could gain the upper hand. Because the contest was too evenly matched, Psycho-Man was introduced into the game by the one who started it all in the first place - the Grandmaster. Psycho-Man used his control box to manipulate the emotions of Terrax and the Surfer into submission. After the Red Hulk had triumphed in his contest with the Hulk, the Grandmaster inserted the red behemoth back into the game, and he destroyed Psycho-Man's armor and the entity inside. With Terrax free of Psycho-Man's control, he was ready to rid the universe of the Silver Surfer with his teammate's help. Red Hulk had other plans, however, and beheaded Terrax with his own axe. Toward the end of the game, Grandmaster revealed he had revived Terrax and placed him back in the time stream where he was found, with no memory of the event.",

      "biography": "He is perhaps the most evil, bloodthirsty, and powerful villain in the universe—so powerful that religious sects have worshipped him as a god. His enemies include nearly every Super Hero in existence. He is obsessed with Goddess Death and has waged genocidal campaigns in an attempt to placate her. Most famously, he has attempted to conquer the universe by wielding the Infinity Gauntlet. He is the Mad Titan.\n\nHe is Thanos.\n\nDivine Right\n\nAs both god and ruler of the Endless Resurgence empire, Thanos controlled his people through a combination of force and fear, viewing freedom as disorder, as a hole in the universe that allows for in randomness and chaos. He saw death as an end to uncertainty, and so, he loved it. Thanos viewed his reign as the natural order of thing. To him, fate and chance are always at war, and his rule demonstrates the preeminence of fate. To help him with his domination, he once possessed a powerful cube that erased the will of his people. Unfortunately for him, he lost it under mysterious circumstances millennia ago, and has since been attempting to get it back.\n\nUnsurprisingly, many civilizations did not enjoy or want Thanos' brutal leadership. Thanos dealt with such uprising brutally, have his soldiers, the Ravens and the Bombardiers, and his sons, such as Gallowglass and Ronan the Accuser, quell any dissidence. For example, after the planet Pyx rose up against his rule, Thanos ordered Ronan to kill all males there over the age of 10.\n\nFrom his birth on Saturn's moon of Titan, Thanos was always an outsider. He carries a Deviants gene, which causes his gruesome and misshapen appearance, with purple, rugged skin. He was born among the last sons of Titan's original colonists: Mentor and Sui-San. His mother, shocked to see such an ugly baby, and sensing his potential for evil, tried to kill Thanos at birth, although she was stopped by his father, A'Lars, AKA Mentor. Thanos later killed her for this attempt. Thanos also has a brother, Starfox (AKA Eros), who he was always jealous of, as Starfox was handsome and popular.\n\nStill, Thanos is an Eternal, a type of super human who, according to the Celestials, was meant to be a protector of Earth. And, with a twisted mind, he took his cosmic duty to heart.",

      "biography": "Athletically and intellectually gifted, young Benn Grimm, regarded as a future football star as early as forth grade, was nicknamed \"Grimm Reaper\" for his line backing skills. At the age of seven, Grimm had befriended fellow student Reed Richards, protecting Reed from bullying students. In turn, Reed helped Ben with his studies, tutoring him in math and science; he also shared his research with Ben, showing him his devices built for accessing other dimensions. In fifth grade, Reed was moved uptown to a government research facility. Ben seldom saw his friend thereafter.\nBen finished high school and soon began college in the New York area. He remained in occasional contact with Reed over the years, and when the time came for Reed to demonstrate his teleportation device, Ben was invited to observe. As the test was during Ben's spring break, he rode cross country to the Nevada test site, where he watched the test beside Reed, Susan and Johnny Storm, and Victor Van Damme. The device malfunctioned and Ben woke up in Mexico City, Transformed into a rocky, brutish Thing. He was taken to the Baxter Building by the U.S. government. When the Baxter Building was attacked by Arthur Molekevic's monster, Ben leapt from the skyscraper and battled the beast. Ben, Reed and Johnny pursued the monster into Molekevic's hidden headquarters beneath Manhattan, where they retrieved Susan Storm, though Ben's massive strength inadvertently collapsed Molekevic's chambers. Molekevic hasn't been seen or heard from since, though he may have escaped.As the U.S. government wanted to keep the foursome a secret, Ben was confined to the Baxter Building for months after his change and limited to weekly phone calls to his family. He accompanied his teammates to Denmark to confront Victor Van Damme, and again into the N-Zone on a voyage of exploration. While Reed and Sue had each other, and Johnny was allowed out in public, Ben was the most isolated of the four, unable to pursue his interests or see his friends, his pro football dreams dead. His first real joy since being changed came when the quartet entered the N-Zone and Ben space-walked for the first time; he found similar moments venturing into the Jurassic Era. After the team went public as the Fantastic Four while battling the alien Nihil in Las Vegas, Ben slowly began to accept what he'd become, even adopting an old football coach's slogan as his battle cry: \"It's Clobberin' Time!\"",

      "biography": "The very skies tremble in his presence. He commands the mystical hammer Mjolnir to protect Asgard and Earth. He is the son of Odin, Prince of Asgard. He is the God of Thunder. He is Thor.\n\nThe God of Thunder\n\nThor was born to the King of the Asgardian Gods, Odin Borson, and the Earth Goddess Gaea. He grew up in Asgard under Odin's tutelage and trained in his footsteps to one day lead Asgard. Besides Odin, his stepmother Frigga and his adopted brother Loki are the only family he know, alongside his best friends Sif, Balder, and the Warriors Three.\n\nThroughout his youth, Thor tested his limits on dangerous missions and became worthy of the Uru hammer Mjolnir, using it to save Sif from the Death Goddess Hela. While the hammer wields destructive powers, it also has the power to build and Thor also uses it to consecrate treaties and bless weddings.\n\nIn Thor's coming of age, he fell through a portal and battled the demigod Hercules. Equal in strength, they fought until Zeus halted their encounter, sending Thor back to Asgard and wiping the memories of both warriors. During the 9th Century, Thor spent time on Earth, leading Vikings into battle. It was not until Thor's loyal Vikings attacked a Christian monastery that he turned his back on his followers, leaving Earth and spending centuries in Asgard.\n\nDuring his time in Asgard, Odin casted Thor into the mortal guise of Siegmund to retrieve the Rhinegold Ring from the dragon Fafnir. When Siegmund took away another's wife, Frigga compelled Odin to kill Thor, but Thor survived as Siegmund's son Siegfried. Odin succeeded at obtaining the Rhinegold Ring from Siegfried, then restored Thor to life without any memories of his former identities.\n\nWhen Thor's battle-hungry appetite led him to break a treaty between Asgard and the Frost Giants, Odin banished him to Earth as a lesson in humility in the form of Dr. Donald Blake. As a human, he had a limp and worked as a physician. When he was compelled by Odin to go to Norway, he came upon extraterrestrials known as the Kronans and fled into a cave. There, he found a gnarled cane and used it to try and escape; he struck it against a rock, and it became Mjolnir. The mallet then restored his memories and returned him to his former glory as the mighty God of Thunder.",

      "biography": "He claims he is the legendary Norse thunder deity Thor, sent to Earth by his father Odin. Official records say he is Thorlief Golmen, who stole his scientist brother Gunnar Golmen's super-soldier technology after suffering a nervous breakdown. Both accounts agree that he believed he was different from an early age, but only came to believe he was Thor after suffering a nervous breakdown just before turning 30, spending the next 18 months in an asylum. After discovering (or stealing, as the case may be) his powers, Thor began spreading his message of social change through lecture tours and books. He initially refused to join the Ultimates, but did help them subdue the monstrous Hulk after the U.S. President met Thor's demand of doubling the U.S.'s foreign aid budget. Thor began working with the Ultimates thereafter, forming a fast friendship with teammate Tony Stark (Iron Man). He helped the Ultimates in their attempt to recruit Hawk-Owl; though Thor declined fulltime Ultimates duty, he reliably aided the team against serious threats. He helped defeat the extraterrestrial Chitauri invasion force, and neutralized a Chitauri doomsday weapon which would have destroyed the solar system. After failing to prevent Magneto from breaching the S.H.I.E.L.D. Triskelion, Thor battled X-Men members Storm and Colossus, finding the latter's strength matched his own. When Norman Osborn's \"Six\" attacked the White House, Thor defeated fellow lightning wielder Electro. He also helped the Ultimates and Fantastic Four gather information about the world destroyer Gah Lak Tus.Thor then found out that Ironman was going to kill Captain America in combat so before Ironman could get to Captain america Thor battled Ironman in the NYC streets and defeated Ironman and was given second command of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Ultimates. Thor met (or hallucinated) fellow Asgardian warrior Volstagg the Voluminous, who warned that Thor's evil half-brother Loki had escaped from the \"room without doors,\" and that the Ultimates were pawns of the New World Order. Quitting the Ultimates in protest after they began operating uninvited in foreign countries, Thor was publicly accused by Captain America of leaking team secrets. Thor later intervened to protect protestors from police at an Italian demonstration against the European Defence Initiative's super-soldier program. Persuaded by Gunnar Golmen that Thor was simply a madman using stolen technology, the Ultimates and the E.D.I. hunted down Thor in Norway, attacking him despite his claims that Gunnar was actually Loki in disguise. Thor held his own until Quicksilver removed his belt, depriving him of his powers. \nHe was then moved to the same holding cell that Bruce Banner had previously occupied.  When Loki and the Liberator's attacked, the Ultimates realized that Loki had been deceiving them.  The Scarlet Witch then summoned Thor from his cell to finish off Loki.  Loki tried again to warp reality to make Thor appear insane, but because the Ultimates' faith in Thor had been restored, his powers didn't work.  As a last-ditch effort, Loki summoned the beasts of Asgard to attack the Ultimates.  Thor then called on his father, Odin, who sent reinforcements in the form of the Knights of Asgard, to aid the Ultimates in their fight.  While the Ultimates fought the monsters, Thor battled Loki, and eventually banished him back to Asgard.With the battle over, Thor tells the Ultimates that the planet is now under his protection.  With the team now knowing that he is truly a God, Thor rejoins the now government-independent team once more.",

Billions of years later, Tarene was born on on the Nucleus of Hope, a hidden world fated to be the Designate's birthplace. Like her fellow citizens, she studied to aid the Designate; like them, she was unaware that she herself was the Designate.\n\nIn recent years, the mad Titan Thanos obtained X'Hoss's objects of power and decimated Tarene's homeworld.

After leaving the military he was approached by Professor Charles Xavier and offered a chance to join the X-Men. He accepted on the condition his brother James could join as well. Xavier agreed.In the months that followed, John and James proved their worth. Tragically, James was killed while fighting Count Nefaria. John, feeling responsible, left the X-Men for some time. He returned months later at the same moment as Apocalypse attacked the X-Men. Unleashing his anger on Apocalypse, Thunderbird was able to save the X-Men, but was captured during Apocalypse's retreat.Apocalypse experimented on Thunderbird, transforming him into the Horseman of War. John eventually broke free of Apocalypse's mind control and defeated his master.

The Timebroker told him that if he did not help the Exiles complete their missions he would remain Apocalypse's servant. During a mission in which the Exiles had to save Alpha Flight from an insane Hulk, T-Bird met an alternate version of himself who had become Shaman. The two bonded and T-Bird was reminded of who he was before Apocalypse took him.T-Bird would also defeat the Hulk by unleashing the full fury of his Apocalypse-created battle mode. Following the battle, John and Nocturne began a relationship that would blossom into love. T-Bird would try to end the relationship, feeling he was not worthy of Nocturne, but she would stick by him. On an Earth ruled by the Skrulls the team was captured. While in captivity, Nocturne told T-Bird she was pregnant. The Exiles eventually escaped but only because the Skrulls evacuated the planet due to the arrival of Galactus.During battle with Galactus, T-Bird sacrificed his own life to save the world. John planted a bomb on Galactus' armor but was caught in the blast and critically injured. Nocturne, believing John would recover, assumed the Exiles would wait for him to get well.

Although he tried to hide it, Eric's inexperience soon showed. However, Masterson  began to master his new abilities and soon replaced Thor in the Avengers. Odin finally freed Thor from banishment, and thought it best for Eric to stay as his replacement, but Odin eventually made Eric his own weapon, a mace called Thunderstrike.Because he could think of nothing better to call himself, he took the name of his mace as his moniker. He eventually found the powers of Thunderstike were different from those of Mjolnir.

However, he was corrupted by the power of the Bloodaxe and went on a rampage. After battling Thor, Eric regained control and turned the Thunderstrike against the Bloodaxe, killing him in the process. Thor wanted his best friend to go to Valhalla for his heroism, but Eric said he was a man first and a hero second, and was sent, by Odin, to his own afterlife.On his gravestone Thor inscribed \"THE WORLD STILL NEEDS HEROES.\"",

      "biography": "A champion Olympic swimmer, Todd Arliss earned nearly half million dollars in advances for public exhibitions, but his dreams came crashing down around him when he injured his back and legs while rescuing a man who had fallen overboard from a private craft. He was told that he would never be able to swim again, so he spent his fortune in seeking any kind of medical help. Dr. Lemuel Dorcas promised Arliss he could help, and, despite the pleas of his sister, Diane, Todd agreed. As part of the process, Dorcas hoped to use his \"morphotron,\" which could imprint the genetic pattern of an animal onto a human. In seeking tiger sharks to use on Todd Arliss, Dorcas accidentally captured the Sub-Mariner as well, and Namor’s genetic pattern was transformed as well as the sharks’, transforming Todd into a superhuman, amphibious creature. Dorcas, a criminally-motivated marine biologist, gave Todd the costume and codename of Tiger Shark, hoping to use him in his own criminal ambitions. Tiger Shark,  however, had other ideas. Even though he was weak from the morphotron, he bested the Sub-Mariner and escaped for the open sea. Happening upon the Sub-Mariner's betrothed, the Lady Dorma, the Shark accompanied her to Atlantis, where he bullied his way into gaining the throne until Namor arrived and recaptured it, imprisoning Tiger Shark with the hopes of returning him to normal.Tiger Shark escaped when Atlantis fell victim to the Serpent Crown and swam to the Sargasso Sea. There, he encountered the Mist-Men of Sargasso, a band of sailors and seamen from various cultures and time periods who were immortal prisoners of the area. Tiger Shark offered to lead them out of the area if they would serve him once they were free. The Sub-Mariner, however, found the mist-locked area and opposed the Shark once more. Tiger Shark escaped in the wake of the explosion of an experimental Nazi torpedo. Not long after, Tiger Shark again crossed paths with the Lady Dorma, who agreed to marry him if he would help save Atlantis from Orka, another of Dr. Dorcas's creations, and the Atlantean traitor Krang. The Shark fought valiantly against Orka and his battalion of killer whales. Locked in battle, both Tiger Shark and Orka were sucked under when a huge crevice opened in the ocean floor.Eventually escaping, Tiger Shark discovered that his amphibious powers were diminishing. Hoping to capture Namor to recharge his powers, he first sought out Dr. Dorcas, but allied with the Lemurian empress Llyra and the scientist Lymondo. Llyra wished vengeance upon Namor for thwarting her ascent to the Atlantean throne. Tiger Shark wanted to use Lymondo's replica of the morphotron to siphon more of Namor's power into himself. Their first attempt to kidnap the Sub-Mariner failed when they kidnapped his ally, the Human Torch, sending their vessel to the sea bottom. Next, the three learned of and kidnapped the Sub-Mariner's human father, Leonard MacKenzie. Namor of course came to the rescue and was captured, placed into the morphotron and used to restore Tiger Shark's prowess. Stingray also appeared, and in the ensuing struggle, Tiger Shark threw a lead pipe at Namor's father, killing him and providing the opportunity to escape. Tiger Shark fled and hid out until he learned that Namor had experienced amnesia concerning the incident. Tiger Shark came out of hiding and was reunited with Dr. Dorcas. Dorcas created the Aquanoids, or \"Men-Fish,\" in a similar process used on Tiger Shark, and he and the Shark captured both the Sub-Mariner and Spider-Man, holding them prisoner in Dorcas’ undersea complex. Namor and Spider-Man escaped captivity, and, in battling the Aquanoids, Spider-Man accidentally triggered the destruction of the undersea base that forced all to flee. Later, they joined the undersea warlord Attuma and with Attuma's Octo-Meks war machines, captured the floating island Hydrobase, taking Namor prisoner. Doctor Doom, who sought Namor as an ally, arrived and attacked Attuma and Tiger Shark, soon freeing the still-weakened Namor and taking him with him. Shortly thereafter, the vengeful Namor attacked Attuma, Dorcas, and Tiger Shark again. The Sub-Mariner hurled the defeated Tiger Shark at Dorcas, but Dorcas moved out of the way in time, and Tiger Shark's body struck an Octo-Mek, causing it to topple and crush him to death. The Sub-Mariner found Tiger Shark and turned him over to the local authorities.Tiger Shark inevitably escaped and made for another try at Namor, this time kidnapping Namorita. He was confronted by Ms. Marvel, who even pursued him beneath the waves where he was defeated by the two heroines and remanded to Atlantean custody.  The criminal Egghead rescued him, making him a member of his Masters of Evil and having him assist Egghead in his plan to totally destroy Hank Pym. Pym managed to turn the tables on all of the Masters, however, and they were taken into police custody. Some time later, Tiger Shark was again freed from prison, this time by Baron Zemo, who wished the Shark to join his own Masters of Evil coalition. Tiger Shark helped the Masters occupy the Avengers mansion headquarters, but he left the group before the Masters' final showdown with the hero team. Tiger Shark was later seen in San Francisco, allied with Whirlwind, another Master of Evil at large, but he was found by Tigra and Hellcat and given over to police custody.Tiger Shark escaped from custody by lowering his body metabolism such as a shark might do, making it seem like he were dead. He was remanded to Stingray for recovery, where he escaped, battling him and kidnapping his sister, Stingray’s wife. Their final battle occurred in an undersea cavern, which threatened to cave-in during the fight. Tiger Shark’s humanity surfaced enough to help Stingray and his sister escape, and he was believed to have died as the cave collapsed. On a later endeavor, the Shark was hired by the Kingpin to kill La Bandera, a hero who was threatening his drug trade. He fought her and her ally, Wolverine, who savagely defeated the villain, leaving him to die by being eaten alive by sharks. Barely escaping with his life, Arliss wandered the seas for a while.He eventually settled in a community of other underwater nomads, starting a new life as Arlys Tigershark. Tiger Shark fell in love with Mara, and the two were married and soon expecting a child. Unfortunately, their peaceful life was not long to be. The Faceless Ones attacked their community, slaughtering them all, including Mara. He was helped to escape by Tamara Rahn, and he joined Namor and the Atlanteans against the Faceless Ones, eventually stopping their threat. He retreated with Tamara to the Sargasso Sea, where he once again joined the People of the Mist as their protector. They once again returned, however, to ally with the Atlanteans, and soon the Fantastic Four, against the alien threat of Xlyym.  Later still, they joined other undersea adventures in the short-lived team Deep Six, banding together for a rescue mission, hoping to save Namor from the Avengers. Namor rebuffed the attack, and Tiger Shark and Tamara left.  Somehow, at some point Tiger Shark mutated into a more monstrous form of a hybrid shark-man, appeared to have limited ability for speech and inhibition as well. In this form, he had somehow abandoned Tamara Rahn and reappeared on the surface world. He was invited to join the latest incarnation of the Masters of Evil, led by the current Crimson Cowl. Tiger Shark continued to be a part of nearly all major activities by the new Masters, running into conflict with the hero team Thunderbolts, who eventually managed to bring the Masters to justice.Tiger Shark has since returned to familiar endeavors. He joined another version of Deep Six that was formed this time by Attuma, who then ruled Atlantis and hoped to stop Namor and his allies, the Defenders. Instead, Namor managed to overthrow the warlord and reclaim the throne. Tiger Shark was later seen imprisoned at Pym Experimental Penitentiary Number One, a prison that kept its super-powered inmates miniaturized, and participated in a breakout led by the Mad Thinker only to be thwarted by She-Hulk. He was also imprisoned on the Raft, escaping during a massive breakout and avoiding capture by the new Avengers. He was instead apprehended by the New Warriors, who managed to track him down and find him still cuffed to the Armadillo.  Recently, the Red Hulk recruited Tiger Shark, along with Terrax and Baron Mordo, to become part of the Offenders to take part in a death duel against the Hulk and the Defenders. Tiger Shark was pitted against his old foe, Namor, the Sub-Mariner, in the Dark Dimension, but they were too evenly matched. Because the contest was a stalemate, the dread Dormammu was placed into the game by the Elders of the Universe who started it all. Dormammu seized the two intruders and demanded they tell him how they entered his world, so he may leave and conquer Earth. After the Red Hulk had triumphed in his contest with the Hulk, the Grandmaster inserted the red behemoth back into the game, and he slaughtered Terrax and the Silver Surfer after absorbing the Power Cosmic. Using the Surfer's board to travel to the Dark Dimension, Red Hulk murdered Tiger Shark, Namor and Dormammu. Later on, the Grandmaster revealed he had revived Tiger Shark and placed him back in his own time, with no memory of the event.",

First encountered by Spider-Man early in the webspinner's career, he appeared to be the leader of an alien task force attempting to control the world. Though Spider-Man stopped the \"invasion\", the Tinkerer got away leaving behind only a rubber mask, leaving a confused Spider-Man to ponder just who or what the Tinkerer really was.Years later, Spider-Man learns that the Tinkerer is an ordinary man who has an extraordinary talent for anything mechanical, and his \"aliens\" were really movie stuntmen in costumes, doing his dirty work.The Tinkerer has in recent years been inventing armor and weapons for various super-criminals, including the Beetle, the Big Wheel, Hobgoblin (Jason Macendale), and the Constrictor. Most recently, Tinkerer was severely injured by Punisher amidst the superhero Civil War. He recovered and went back to his work, but was eventually arrested. His son, Rick Mason struck a bargain with Norman Osborn to have the Tinkerer released upon completion of a single mission. Osborn agreed and kept his word after Mason delivered on his end.",

      "biography": "Mary MacPherran was born prematurely to a poor family, both of which contributed to her small and fragile frame that she never quite grew out of. The more popular girls in high school would tease her with the name “Skeeter,” short for mosquito, and the name stuck. Her only friend was Marsha Rosenberg, herself a social outcast. Mary had only enough time for work and school and little else, and she spend her spare time dreaming of winning the lottery or of being struck with a sudden superhuman origin. One day, she happened upon one of the first sightings of Spider-Woman (Julia Carpenter). Caught up in the public fervor over her appearance, Mary claimed that she was Spider-Woman. The rumor got out, and the insinuation was enough to get her and Marsha invited to an important social function hosted by her high school rival. Unfortunately, this happened at the same time the Beyonder (now, the Maker) tore a section of Denver in order to create the Battleworld for a collection of Earth’s heroes and villains to fight each other.  Mary was made an even bigger pariah when the real Spider-Woman appeared to save the party guests. Despondent and hopeless, Mary fled with Marsha only to encounter Doctor Doom. Doom offered the women a chance to become superpowered in exchange for joining his army. Mary agreed, and Doom used the alien technology of Battleworld to tranform her into Titania and Marsha into Volcana. Titania and Volcana joined the other villains, where she immediately found company with the Absorbing Man, whose raw physical power she greatly admired. The villains successfully attacked the heroes’ fortress, and Titania managed to fight various X-Men to a standstill. She even seemed a match for She-Hulk; however, Titania failed to see the fight through and was forced to ask for help from the other super criminals. Her confidence shattered, she fought Spider-Man, but despite her superior strength, Spider-Man defeated her, and she has had a strong fear of facing Spider-Man in combat ever since. Soon, the villains banded together to escape with the Molecule Man, who used his power to return the Denver suburb to Earth. Titania and the Absorbing Man remained together as a couple, even participating in many crimes together. The two were recruited by Baron Zemo in his incarnation of the Masters of Evil, but they encountered the Wasp and Ant-Man (Scott Lang) before they could rendezvous with the team. Most often, though, Titania would seek out ways to pit herself against She-Hulk, always hoping to have the chance to redo the outcome of their initial fight, which Titania always considered her first true failure. Time and time again, however, She-Hulk would always best her.After many months, Titania and Absorbing Man got married, with Volcana as her bridesmaid. Although their large, super villain-filled wedding ceremony was interrupted by the Avengers, the heroes left Titania and the Absorbing Man alone. Both villains had seemed to have turned away from more malicious actions, preferring to quietly keep each other's company, although they never gave up bank robberies and other activities completely. Titania and Absorbing Man occasionally continued to come into conflict with superheroes, such as the Black Widow, who, in a vendetta to dispose of all Avenger's villains, shattered the Absorbing Man's altered form. (The Absorbing Man would later recover.) Later, the couple attempted to rob the high class restaurant Heaven's Grill, where they were stopped by Luke Cage and She-Hulk.Later still, the Absorbing Man returned to crime, revealing that Titania was dying of cancer and that he needed to pay for treatment. They kidnapped a doctor but were confronted by Thor, who convinced them to seek professional care. Titania soon recovered, but she became obsessed with the idea of besting She-Hulk. She trained in an all-consuming manner, so much so that she failed to notice when the Absorbing Man was remanded to police custody. She managed to boost her strength to unprecedented levels and raced to confront She-Hulk. With one punch, however, She-Hulk kayoed Titania. In fact, She-Hulk herself had similarly reached new levels of strength, as she had just come from training for an interstellar bout that pitted her against Tryco Slatterus, the Champion of the Universe. Now called the Fallen One because he lost the bout, Tryco offered Titania the use of his Infinity Gem of Power, training her with it so she could defeat She-Hulk. (After which, Titania prompty dropped a mountain on him, so he wouldn’t take the gem away.) Titania did indeed best She-Hulk and would have killed her if She-Hulk didn’t manage to slip away after transforming into her alter ego of Jennifer Walters. Awesome Andy, the Avengers, the Fantastic Four, and Spider-Man all tried to keep Titania at bay, but she defeated them all. Ultimately, Jennifer tricked Titania into thinking she killed She-Hulk, but it was really Ditto, a shape-changing process server. It was enough to allow Titania to fulfill her single-minded purpose, which released her hold on the Power Gem. Now She-Hulk, with a bigger overriding desire to see Titania thwarted, was able to wrest the gem from Titania’s brow and defeated her. She was imprisoned again, serving time at Pym Experimental Penitentiary Number One, a prison that kept its super-powered inmates miniaturized.",

      "biography": "British-born Mortimer Toynbee was abandoned by his parents so early in childhood that he cannot remember them. He was placed in an orphanage where the other children, who regarded him as a freak due to his ugliness, his unusual physique, and his leaping ability, continually tormented him. Toynbee was so traumatized by his loneliness and the continual abuse he received that it affected his learning abilities. The teachers and administrators in the orphanage therefore regarded Toynbee as mentally retarded, even though, in actuality, he was of normal intelligence. So desperate did Toynbee become for affection that he developed a pathetically subservient personality, and would unquestioningly obey anyone he thought sincerely cared about him. Mortimer Toynbee is a former subject of the Alamogordo Project, which observed the development of genetically flawed mutants. Due to his flawed genetic make-up, Toynbee experienced extreme physical changes and mental instability throughout his life, at one point requiring him to ingest a prescription drug Ridilin to remain stable. At some point after achieving adulthood, Toynbee was discovered by Magneto and recruited for his Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. Magneto gave Toynbee the alias of the Toad because of Toynbee's powers, appearance, and personality. The Toad blinded himself to Magneto's continual verbal and physical abuse because Magneto was out to conquer the human race that had rejected the Toad.As a member of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, the Toad met the Scarlet Witch and became infatuated with her, though she did not reciprocate the feeling. The team's nefarious schemes would often be confronted and defeated by the mutant heroes known collectively as the X-Men.After one such confrontation with the X-Men, Magneto and the Toad were captured by the alien called the Stranger and imprisoned on the alien's distant world. When Magneto first escaped, he callously left the Toad behind, and the Toad's attitude toward his master began to change. After being recaptured, Magneto escaped a second time and took the Toad with him, but his continued bullying caused the Toad's resentment to increase until it flared into murderous hatred. The Toad abandoned Magneto to die in an explosion that followed an encounter with the Avengers. (Although it was later discovered that Magneto survived.)Toad was once captured with Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch on the world of Arkon, but after their adventure there, he elected to stay instead of returning to Earth. Eventually, the Toad built a dimensional breach/space ship that allowed him to return to the Stranger's homeworld, where he studied and stole the Stranger's technology and equipment in an effort to become more powerful and thus more appealing to the Scarlet Witch. However, just as he prepared to return to Earth, he learned that the Scarlet Witch had married the Vision. Enraged, he planned to strike out at her, attacked the Avengers to learn her whereabouts, and was defeated.He served a short prison term and was released, at which time he commissioned the criminal Arcade to construct a sort-of \"toad kingdom,\" complete with a series of deadly traps, in a seemingly deserted castle in upstate New York. Renaming himself the Terrible Toad King, he planned to entrap everyone who he felt had abused him, placing them in the palace where they would be killed in the attempt to escape. His first victim was the X-Men’s Angel, but the Toad accidentally kidnapped the Thing, too. Just as the two were about to escape, Arcade stepped in and demanded immediate payment for his services. Unable to pay and fearful for his own life, the Toad fell into a panic. The Angel took pity on Toynbee and formulated an agreement with him to convert the castle into an amusement park, paying the debt in the process. The endeavor was a success until it was discovered that the castle's original owner was the villain Victor von Doom. Doctor Doom sent a robot of himself and a security force to remove the Toad and restore the structure to its original state.Toynbee again fell into despondency and decided to commit suicide, an attempt which was interrupted by Spider-Man. Hoping to make Spider-Man his friend, he hired a group of criminals to attack Spider-Man, but in the process he met Frog-Man and Spider-Kid. The three formed a partnership of their own called the Misfits.Though seeking the help of a psychiatrist during this period, Toynbee was still obsessed with the Scarlet Witch. He used some robot doppelgangers of the original Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, but was stopped by Quicksilver. Toynbee and his automatons were removed to a government research facility (Project: PEGASUS) for study, but one of the robots reactivated on a timed program and freed its builder. Ultimately he again came into conflict with Spider-Man, whose approval he still valued. The Toad defeated Spider-Man and the Vision using a powerful robotic exoskeleton. Forcing his way into the New Jersey home owned by the Scarlet Witch and the Vision, he found the Scarlet Witch eight months pregnant. Finding her repulsive, he attacked her. She defeated him, but he escaped.Months later, Toad resurfaced again with new powers, a heightened intelligence, and a vicious mean streak. He tried to form his own Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (simply called \"the Brotherhood,) and revived a long-dormant Sauron. This brought him into conflict with the fledgling team X-Force, who forced the team to escape. Another time, he sought an ally in the villain Gideon, and the two played a game which pit several groups of mutants against Harness, Piecemeal, and the scientific criminal organization A.I.M. who attempted to resurrect the mutant Proteus. Eventually, however, Toad's Brotherhood simply went their separate ways.At this point, Toad tried to join the Inner Circle of the Hellfire Club, but was soundly rejected. Feeling sorry for him, Hellfire Club member Emma Frost let Toad live on her estate in Canada, where, with fellow-mutant the Surgeon, he built himself head of an army of frogs. When Frost's team of young mutants, Generation X, took temporary residence at the estate, they ended up battling the Toad in a misunderstanding.Later, the Toad was recruited by former teammate Blob to join a new version of the Brotherhood of Mutants, this time in order to help safeguard X-Men leader Professor X from the artificial intelligence, Cerebro. Afterwards, the Toad was recruited into yet another Brotherhood of Mutants, led by Mystique. The team was hired by an unknown source to recover the parts of the android Machine Man, which were believed destroyed after a battle between the Red Skull, S.H.I.E.L.D. and the X-Men. The Brotherhood was forced to retreat by Machine Man, however.At a time when the High Evolutionary stripped all mutants of their powers, the Toad's DNA mutated further when the world's mutants reverted to normal. He since possessed a more normal-looking appearance as well as strange new powers. Afterwards, the Toad was abducted by the sentient space ship Prosh along with others associated with the X-Men, in order to stop a cosmic threat. During this time-traveling adventure, the Toad discovered that, as an infant, he and thousands of other mutant babies were experimented upon and studied by a clandestine facility known as Black Womb, a facility that hoped to track the evolution of mutantkind. Ultimately, in a battle with the alien Stranger, the Toad was wounded to the point of death, but Prosh healed him, resulting in an altered appearance and strange new powers. Prosh then returned the Toad and the others to the present day.The Toad appeared in several disparate areas over the next few months. He briefly joined Mystique's new Brotherhood, he later entered the Blood Sport (an ultimate fighting tournament based in Madripoor) where he killed the villain Eel (although the Eel has since reappeared.) He also turned up in Magneto's nation of Genosha, which had just been destroyed by Sentinels, and the Toad helped construct a monument to Magneto's legacy. When Magneto later reappeared, attempting to take over the world once more, the Toad joined him as an aide-de-camp, often speaking to the masses on behalf of Magneto, until they were defeated by the X-Men. (This Magneto was later revealed to have been Kuan-Yin Xorn in masquerade.)Toynbee has appeared more lucid and reflective of his actions of late, such as when he recently used his abilities to help another mutant in need. Since then, Toynbee has joined the band of mutant refugees that have come to be called the 198.",

He was bought by Lippy Louie to fight against his enemy, Boss Barker’s, choice. Though he didn’t want to murder anyone his entire purpose for being became fighting and winning in the great games. What kept him from turning on his masters was the Skrulls’ sonic disruptor that they threatened his, and every other slave’s home planet with.Soon the Fantastic Four’s Thing was also brought to the games, purchased by Barker, and left as Torgo’s cellmate before they fought in the arena. Ben tried to convince Torgo to join him against the slave masters, but Torgo felt that there was no choice and he refused-focusing only on the games. When the Thing later attempted to break free, Torgo explained that they kept a hypnotic machine in each cell that would convince their prisoners not to be able to use their powers or strength against them, which the Thing soon found out to his misfortune.Then the games began and the slave masters brought Torgo and the Thing to the arena and explained that they must fight to the death or their home planets would be thrown out of orbit. After a fight between Cat Man and Primitoid, the masters set the Torgo and Ben against each other. Ben still didn’t believe there was a real threat, but the Skrulls set a group of asteroids hurtling into Earth’s Sun, convincing him. Torgo then grabbed a ball thrown to him to use as a weapon and hurtled it at the Thing, who promptly smashed it, causing it to explode. But Torgo didn’t want to win by trickery, though he still attacked Ben as he got up. Ben’s speed was quicker, however, and he hit him first. Though due to the mix-up with the weapon, their fight was restarted.They faced each other again with a set of two-sided weapons. Torgo attacked first, using the weapon with his greater experience, but Ben soon got upset and turned his own weapon against Torgo, wrapping it around him and squeezing. Ben found himself unable to kill Torgo and he released enough pressure for Torgo to break free. Then Torgo used the nerve-gas at the end of his own weapon, weakening Ben, and prepared to crush him with the bludgeon side. Before he could Torgo found that he was unable to kill Ben, either, as Ben had shown him mercy earlier. The Skrulls then threatened both of their planets, but the Fantastic Four’s Crystal, who arrived with the rest of their group, destroyed their weapon before they could use it.Without the threat to his homeworld, Torgo turned on the slave masters and released the other slaves. Together they revolted against their controllers while the Fantastic Four escaped in their stolen Skrull saucer. The fate of the fighter Torgo, however, remains unknown.",

      "biography": "Born into a long line of Irish New York police officers, Patrick Mulligan was living his family's dream. Recently married to a loving woman named Gina, the couple had a baby on the way, and his NYPD career was going perfectly. However, Patrick didn't expect a chance encounter with the psychotic Carnage, who was enraged at his own impending asexual pregnancy. Carnage implanted Patrick with his \"other\", and left the new Symbiote to incubate within him. At the same time,&nbsp;Venom&nbsp;argued with Carnage over the Symbiote offspring. Carnage insisted on killing it, but Venom was concerned that as the 1,000th Symbiote of their line, \"Toxin\" could potentially become psychotic as a result of genetic breakdown. Carnage tracked his offspring to Patrick's apartment, and threw Gina down a stairwell.&nbsp;Spider-Man&nbsp;was able to save Gina, while Black Cat managed to distract Carnage.\n\nPatrick continued his life, haunted by his encounter with Carnage. He soon discovered that he was much faster and stronger than before, and was easily able to subdue Black Cat before she could escape his questioning. However, Carnage interrupted the conversation, attacking Patrick and the Cat. Patrick became Toxin, saving Cat. Though unnerved by his transformation, Patrick decided that his new powers could be used for good. Teaming up with Spider-Man to stop an armed robbery, Patrick found himself filled with murderous urges. He struggled to keep himself together, telling Spider-Man that he was only \"joking\" about eating the robbers' brains.\n\nMulligan later used his powers to save Spider-Man and Black Cat from Venom and Carnage, beating them both single-handedly. He realized that he had much in common with Spider-Man and made the web-slinger his role model. Realizing his presence was putting Gina and newborn Edward in serious danger, Pat left them behind, offering Gina little explanation. Patrick now walked the streets of New York alone, as Toxin, hoping to learn as much as he could from Spider-Man.\n\nA short time after fighting Venom and Carnage, Toxin began helping to find the escaped criminals from the Raft. The first criminal he hunted down was King Cobra. Patrick visited&nbsp;Mr. Hyde&nbsp;at Ryker's Island, hoping to obtain information on King Cobra. Hyde gave no help, but did give a piece of King Cobra's skin he had previously shed. Using the piece of skin, Toxin located Cobra, and after a small scuffle, defeated him. After the battle, Spider-Man came to Pat enlisting his aid to bring in the criminal Razor-Fist, giving him a bloody bandage to aid in Toxin's hunt.\n\nAt this point in his life it was becoming continually more difficult for Mulligan to control the symbiote. Toxin liked the violence, and it was getting increasingly harder for Patrick to refrain from killing. Eventually, Toxin was able to locate Razor Fist, but instead of changing into Toxin, he changed into a small, middle-aged man, Toxin called Larry. A twisted joke Toxin decided to play on Pat for never letting him have any \"fun\". After Patrick pleaded for the symbiote's help, he eventually emerged. After a short fight, RazorFist escaped. Toxin then defeated and captured the criminal known as The&nbsp;Answer. Patrick could think of only one to solution the childlike monster that brought out his worst: suicide.\n\nMulligan attempted to jump in front of a subway train, but was saved by the symbiote (who viewed this as \"a cry for help\"). After the attempted suicide, Toxin brought down the&nbsp;Wrecker&nbsp;and&nbsp;Piledriver, two members of the criminal group known as the&nbsp;Wrecking Crew. Patrick and Toxin made an agreement to allow Pat two hours a day to become Larry and see his family, and Toxin would in turn get two hours late at night for \"playtime\". Conditions of the agreement being no acts of arson, grand theft, or homicide. RazorFist killed Mulligan's father in an attempt to gain information about Patrick. Toxin found and beat RazorFist, taking his razor fists, and bringing him to justice.",

Growing up as the only one of his kind with a need to live in water most of the time, he feels the burden of isolation. Later, he comes to breathe outside water with the help of an artificial breathing apparatus. \n\nAs cousin to Black Bolt, King of the Inhumans, he dutifully carries out his role as an undersea scout and supports the Royal Family against foes like his cousin Maximus the Mad and the sorceress Morgan Le Fay. \n\n \n\nAmphibious Inhuman\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTriton is a member of the Inhumans, a sub-species of humanity from the city Attilan that was diverged through Kree experiments. Early in the 20th century, the philosopher priest Mander and his biologist wife, Azur, members of the Royal Family, broke tradition and put their one-year-old son, Triton, through Terrigenesis to unlock his super powered potential.\n\nThe Inhumans were unaware that their new forms sometimes resembled aliens the Kree had encountered, as their creators had hoped to better infiltrate those races. Post exposure, Triton’s form adapted for an aquatic existence—with a piscine appearance matching the alien Pelagians, and no longer able to breathe air. He must wear a cumbersome breathing apparatus that allows him to survive out of water.\n\nTo better care for him, Triton’s mother, Azur, retrained in marine biology to live underwater in a specially designed alcove on Attilan’s shore, an island off Atlantis’ coast. When Triton’s brother Karnak was born, he was spared Terrigenesis to avoid similarly detrimental results. Azur died in an undersea mishap with Triton when he was at the tumultuous age of fourteen. \n\nAs the only amphibious Inhuman at this time, Triton grew up feeling isolated, emotionally and physically, but drawn to the oceans. But he also needed to be around his people. To service this duality, at age eighteen, Triton became an undersea scout, monitoring human oceangoing traffic nearby. \n\nTriton was the first Inhuman to leave Attilan, and when he did so he encountered humans for the first time. He unwittingly disrupted an underwater movie shoot, was captured, and taken to Manhattan where he broke free and received a fearful reception from every human he met. Returning to Attilan, he warned his king and cousin, Black Bolt, about humanity’s paranoia, prompting the silent monarch to relocate the entire island to The Great Refuge, located in a more isolated area of the Himalayas.",

He started a job making signs for Ace Signs, but was laid off after the company got a new owner. All of these events made him crack, and decided to take revenge on the new owner. Soon Gordon, now known as Typeface, began vandalizing the city, beating up thugs, and even managed to defeat Spider-Man.\nWhen Typeface finally caught up to the man who fired him, Spider-Man intervened again, only to be attacked by the Spider-Hybrid. The attack reminded Typeface his brother's last words to him (\"Just live, man\"), and aided Spidey against the foe, and lost the desire for revenge. However, the owner was humiliated by Typeface and found the detonator Typeface would've used to blow up the building they were in. When he blew up the building, he killed himself, and it was believed that Typeface had died in the explosion, too.After surviving the explosion, Typeface became a vigilante, and waged a war with the Penny-Ante Gang. And after apprehending them, left a note saying \"Compliments from your friendly neighborhood Typeface\".Recently Typeface emerged as the leader of an Anti-Registration group along with Battlestar, Solo, and other heroes. Most recently, Typeface was involved in a battle against the new, government-sponsored team of Thunderbolts - including Songbird, the Radioactive Man and Venom - who were trying to capture him and Daredevil for remaining unregistered. He was accidentally killed while trying to evade capture.Note: Typeface's face was covered with various painted letters, some with meaning including an \"A\" on his forehead (which stands for \"annihilation\") or \"R\" (for \"retribution\").",

      "biography": "Edie Sawyer’s mutant teleportation abilities first manifested when she was twelve years old after she was suspected of sleepwalking. A few years later, Edie fell in love with a young boy who was visiting from San Francisco and became pregnant. Scared at the thought of being a mother so young, Edie unconsciously teleported herself to Hollywood shortly after giving birth to her daughter. Ironically, Edie’s own biological father was just “passing through town,” an arrangement made by her parents since her adopted father could not conceive children. After a failed attempt at starting an acting career, Edie turned to a life of crime until she learned of a new media savvy team of superhuman mutants named X-Force. Deciding to become a superhero, Edie persisted until she was accepted as a member.Renaming herself U-Go Girl, Edie quickly became a celebrity and subsequently vied for leadership of the team. Being the most senior member, Edie expected to lead the team and was shocked when newcomer the Orphan was named leader at a press conference. The Orphan’s style of leadership soon clashed with the wishes of the team’s backer, trillionaire software developer Spike Freeman, and so the team’s Coach was assigned to dispose of him and he enlisted Edie’s aid, promising her the team’s leadership in return. When she teleported to Orphan’s home, she discovered he played Russian roulette with a revolver every night. Loading the gun fully with bullets, Edie left, but was later struck with remorse over her actions. She was stopped from warning Orphan by Coach, who tried to kill her; however after the timely arrival of The Orphan, Edie shot and killed Coach.Edie and Orphan eventually fell in love, and she helped him overcome his suicidal tendencies. He, in turn, helped her sort out her erratically functioning powers by accompanying her back home to see her family. Later, Edie was mortally wounded by one of a team of genetically altered humans named the Bush Rangers who had taken control of a space station. As she lay dying in Orphan’s arms, she told him that she wanted to be buried out in space rather than have her grave on Earth become a tourist trap, and that she’d thought of a new name for the team - the X-Statix.",

      "biography": "John Walker was born in Custer's Grove, Georgia to Caleb and Emily Walker. Instilled at an early age with patriotic feelings for his country he eventually joined the army like his brother Mike, who died in the Vietnam War. As soon as he was recruited the war ended and John's hopes of becoming an American Hero were crushed. He then left the military service were he heard of a person known as the Power Broker. When he learned from his friend that the Power Broker could give anyone superhuman powers, he sought out the Power Broker and signed up for the treatment with his friends. After he gained superhuman strength Walker was confronted by a man named Ethan Thurm, who convinced Walker to become the Super-Patriot. As Super-Patriot, Walker toured the country speaking at demonstrations and rallies. One day while in New York City Walker criticized Captain America's morals and ideals, saying that they were old and outdated. During his speech a group of men calling themselves the Bold Urban Commandos or \"Buckies\" attacked Walker. Walker easily defeated the Buckies and it is later learned that the Buckies were actually working for Walker at the time. Captain America eventually came into conflict with Walker and lost the fight. Sometime later Walker was approached by Valerie Cooper and asked to become the new Captain America. Walker agreed instantly and asked his if former partners the Buckies could join him. The Commission on Superhuman Activities refused all but Lemar Hoskins who became the new Bucky. Together Lemar and Walker trained with Freedom Force's Blob, Pyro, and Avalanche.  After a little time the Commission hired Taskmaster to train Walker to be able to fight like Captain America. Meanwhile Steve Rogers used the identity of the Captain and tried to reclaim his title of Captain America. During his time as Captain America the terrorist group known as the Watchdogs killed his father and mother. Also during his time as Captain America two of his former friends became Left-Winger and Right-Winger, whom he killed while in a rage. Eventually Rogers and Walker encountered one another and battled until both Walker and Rogers learned that it was the Red Skull who was manipulating the two of them. After the battle Walker finally realized what the costume symbolized and returned it to Steve Rogers.Months later, the Commission held a demonstration of their new operative, U.S.Agent. In the demonstration U.S.Agent faced off against the Iron Monger and easily defeated the armor and its pilot. He then was sent on several solo missions including one against a British team called the Super Soldiers. On one of his early solo missions he joined forces with Captain America to stop a faction of Watchdogs. During this battle Captain America was worried about what Walker might do to the Watchdogs since they killed his family. However Walker restrained himself and proved himself worthy to Captain America.Later, he was ordered to join the Avengers West Coast by the government in order to keep tabs on them. While in the Avengers he had frequent fights with fellow Avenger Hawkeye and fought many villains such as Magneto, Doctor Demonicus, Ultron, Hydro-Man, Grim Reaper, and several others. During one mission the Avengers West Coast fought the Bogatyri, a Russian mercenary group who had allied themselves with Doctor Demonicus and Klaw. Throughout these battles between the two teams U.S.Agent formed a grudge with Zevzda Dennista. After a battle on Doctor Demonicus's island a reactor exploded and the island began to sink. Overcoming their grudge Walker asked Zevzda if she wanted a ride home. She declined and instead kissed U.S.Agent.While still an active Avenger, Walker continued to work on solo missions which included trying to bring down the Scourge of the Underworld organization, including its creator Thomas Halloway, but due to lack of evidence the courts could not put Thomas in jail. One of his solo missions included stopping a riot and a superhuman powerhouse named Peacemonger from terrorizing a local neighborhood. Another mission forced him to confront Nomad, who at the time had a warrant out for his arrest. Another one of Walkers most noted solo escapades was when he sought out a minority killer in Texas who kept killing all the Hispanics who came into town.\nWhen the Avengers West Coast was disbanded, U.S.Agent was asked to join Force Works by Iron Man. He accepted the invitation and fought against many foes including the Mandarin and other foes. After Force Works disbanded U.S.Agent went solo again and encountered Wolverine and was critically injured by a person known as Protocide. After he recovered he led a team of government operatives called the Jury in order to apprehend the team called the Thunderbolts. Failing the Jury moved on and Walker was approached by S.T.A.R.S. who offered him a job. John accepted and worked for S.T.A.R.S. for a long time. During which he fought Captain America, stopped the Power Brokers vile plans, stopped an intergalactic plot by Ronan the Accuser, even managing to knock Ronan out. Eventually, a government official named Dell Rusk, who little to Walkers knowledge was actually the Red Skull ordered the formation of a new team of Invaders. One of Walkers first priorities was to free Blazing Skull from Middle Eastern terrorists. Walker freed Todd and along with his fellow Invaders; Thin Man, Tara, Jim Hammond, Union Jack, Spitfire, Namor, the Fin, and many others freed the oppressed nation of Mazikhandar, eventually coming into conflict with the Avengers. During the confrontation he and Captain America clashed once again. After a long battle the enraged U.S.Agent was beaten by the Captain and tied up. In order to calm him down Hawkeye shot Walker in the butt, but contrary to his belief this only made Walker madder. After the Thin Man killed the ruler of Mazikhandar, it became a protectorate of Atlantis.The Invaders continued to work on international missions, leading them to come into conflict with Axis Mundi members Baroness Blood, Meranno, Warrior Woman, Agent Axis, Gotteskrieger, and the cloned army of insectoid terrorists known as Pterorists. On one of his many missions with the Invaders, Baron Strucker sent Wolverine who was under the control of Hydra, to kill the members of the Invaders, specifically Namor. During the battle that followed Blazing Skull's left arm and leg was sliced off. Walker ordered the Skull to heal himself as he went to face Wolverine on his own. As Wolverine was about to kill Namor, Walker stabbed Wolverine in the back with his shield. Walker then smashed Wolverine to the ground and beat him to a pulp. He then continued to beat up Wolverine by tossing him near an explosive canister. U.S.Agent then shot at the canister causing it and Logan to burst into flames. Once Wolverine was thoroughly beaten Walker helped Namor get medical treatment. Afterwards Namor expressed his undying gratitude and the honor he had working with U.S.Agent. Later U.S.Agent attended the funeral of Jim Hammond and expressed his gratitude to the fallen hero.After the Invaders seemingly disbanded Walker returned to the United States and donned his old Black costume and continued to work for the government. Recently he Civil War|registered with the Superhuman Registration Act and continued to serve his country. However the government and Tony Stark had different plans for him. Walker then snuck into Stark Tower and met with Tony when he asked to see him. In the meeting Tony told him that he was ordered to goto Canada and become a member of the new Alpha Flight Program. Enraged that they would think of sending him to Canada, Walker told Tony he was an American hero. Tony asked him once again, but Walker refused and left. Sometime later Walker and a team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents were assigned on a mission when the agents started to fire on Walker and a nearby helicopter. Walker started to flee thinking Tony was trying to have him arrested. However when he noticed the helicopters crew was in danger he saved them. He then turned his attention to the agents and easily took them out. He then realized that it was the Purple Man who was controlling the agents, but before he could react the Purple Man took control of Walker. Purple Man ordered Walker to leave his shield and jump off of the flying vehicle they were in. Unable to refuse, Walker jumped and was severly injured in the fall. Later as Walker recovered, Tony approached him again and told him that S.H.I.E.L.D. information said that Purple Man was heading to Canada. Mad with the circumstances Walker agreed to be a member of the new Omega Flight Program and left for Canada.Arriving in Canada John was reuinited with former West Coast Avenger, Arachne and apprehended the superhuman known only as Daisy. From there they joined the Omega Flight team to discuss Michael Pointer's membership on the team. Meanwhile the Wrecking Crew were terrorizing downtown Toronto and beating up fellow Flight member Sasquatch who in turn was possessed by the demonic Tanaraq. Also the Wrecking Crew were enlisted in the aide by a mystical entity and demonic hordes were freed from an undisclosed location to rampage Canada. Alerted to the information the team went into action and fought against the Wrecking Crew, the possessed Sasquatch, and the demon hordes. After both the Crew and Tanaraq were taken care of fellow Flight member Beta Ray Bill led the demons into a dimensional rift, which was destroyed by Pointer, trapping Bill with the demons. After the battle U.S.Agent stayed with Omega Flight and took revenge upon the Purple Man, reclaiming his shield.After some time, John was contacted by Loki disguised as the Scarlet Witch in order to incorporate him into Hank Pym's latest version of Avengers. Teleported away from his Omega Flight teammates John helped this new incarnation of Avengers defeat the elder god Chthon and cemented his status and position on the new Avengers team.After this new team of Avengers was recognized by G.R.A.M.P.A., a global peacekeeping agency, they faced several threats such as an incursion into the Baxter Building which lead to a confrontation with the Fantastic Four, fighting against the former Inhuman king known as the Unspoken, and coming into conflict with Norman Osborn's team of Avengers and a cosmic cube empowered Absorbing Man. After the Absorbing Man fiasco Norman Osborn pulled rank on U.S.Agent and as the Head of National Security he stripped Walker of his title as U.S.Agent and ordered him to leave his team of Avengers.Unhappy with the situation, Walker rejoined his team of Avengers during the siege of Asgard to intercept the Thunderbolts from stealing the Spear of Odin. During the ensuing conflict Walker was targeted by Thunderbolts leader Scourge who, after a lengthy and epic struggle, proceeded to sever Walker's left hand and leg. After the Spear was recovered thanks to Paladin, Stature carried Walker away from the battlefield to get him medical treatment. Recently, Walker was fitted with a regular prosthetic for his left arm and is confined to a wheelchair after the incident in Asgard. Walker was then put in the position of the warden of the Raft.",

      "biography": "Billions of years ago, the technologically-advanced extraterrestrial race known as the Watchers decided it was their duty to help the universe's less advanced races. In their first such experiment, proposed by Ikor, a delegation of four brought atomic energy knowledge to the planet Prosilicus. The Prosilicans accepted the gift, but used it to develop nuclear weapons and engaged in an auto-genocidal war. Ashamed, the Watchers vowed never again to interfere in the affairs of other races. Ikor drafted a code of ethics based upon strict noninterference and passive observation that was so strict that if another being were dying at a Watcher's feet, the Watcher would offer no aid. With their new code established, the Watchers evacuated their homeworld and relocated throughout the galaxies, each Watcher choosing a solar system where they could observe and mentally record the lives of other races for the sake of eventually sharing it with their fellow Watchers. The Watchers would then sporadically reassemble to pool their knowledge and share what they had witnessed. Ikor's son, Uatu, chose Earth's solar system as his new home and was based in the \"Blue Area\" of Earth's moon, an abandoned settlement built by the alien Kree and Cotati, from which he observed Earth for billions of years. At first, Uatu adhered to his race's vow of non-interference: he did not physically intervene when the Gunan known as Xakku the Sun-Stealer threatened to transport Earth's sun to his own solar system (although he did trick the alien into expending his oxygen tanks before he could accomplish his mission) and even spurned the affections of the extraterrestrial Queen Kalthea, who offered Uatu her hand in marriage after his appearance caused the barbarians threatening her kingdom to retreat; but over the centuries, Uatu grew so fond of the lifeforms he observed that he occasionally violated his vow of non-interference when Earth's existence was threatened. Uatu's first recorded encounter with an Earthling occurred in the year 1602 A.D. when a possible-future Captain America was inadvertently sent back in time to that era, causing ripples in the timestream that threatened the very fabric of reality. Uatu revealed the nature of the problem to an Elizabethan-era version of Dr. Stephen Strange, who helped send the temporally-displaced Captain America back through a time-portal, correcting the timeline. Uatu's superior, however, allowed the divergent timeline (Earth-311) to persist in a pocket dimension. Decades ago, Uatu assisted the Destroyer (Roger Aubrey), Iron Cross (Helmut Gruler), Nathaniel Richards, and Howard Stark on a mission to save mankind.In modern times, Uatu met the Fantastic Four when they visited the Moon to investigate the Blue Area. The criminal mastermind Red Ghost and his Super-Apes had also landed there and soon attacked the Thing. Uatu revealed his presence to the Earthlings and ended the fight, decreeing that the Fantastic Four would battle Red Ghost and his simian cohorts. Uatu was impressed with the FF's victory and gave them his blessings, allowing them to retain their memories of his existence. Uatu became fond of the Fantastic Four and began to warn them of impending dangers, such as the Molecule Man, who gained matter-manipulation powers in a lab accident. After the Molecule Man's defeat, Uatu transported the villain to an other-dimensional world where time passed at an accelerated rate and reinforced the self-imposed mental blocks which limited Molecule Man's ability to use his powers. Soon after, at the wedding of Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Woman, Uatu helped Mr. Fantastic defeat the horde of super-villains who threatened the ceremony by transporting him to the Watcher's home and not dis-allowing him to pick a weapon to send the villains back to before they were controlled, and erase their memories. Afterwards, Uatu allowed Reed and Sue to honeymoon in the Blue Area's city, providing an opulent banquet hall and assuring the newlyweds that they would be the only beings in the galaxy that he would not be watching that night. Later, when Galactus first menaced Earth, Uatu tried to hide the planet from the world-devourer, debated him as to why the Earth should be spared, and finally helped the Human Torch obtain the only weapon capable of destroying the cosmic menace -- the Ultimate Nullifier. Uatu also studied alternate realities, which he observed through a portal given to him by the Time-Keepers, a group of beings who existed at the end of time itself. Eventually, Uatu disgraced himself completely by physically opposing the Kree soldier Captain Mar-Vell after allying himself with the Lunatic Legion, a Kree faction opposed to Mar-Vell who were led by Zarek, Fer-Porr, and Sro-Himm and based in the Moon's Blue Area. Placed on trial by his own people for his numerous violations of their ethics code, Uatu explained that he had come to identify with the action and emotion that he observed on Earth, and thus yearned to become involved. At the conclusion of his trial, Uatu was released from custody on his own recognizance after promising never to interfere in the affairs of other races again. Later, Uatu was captured by intergalactic gambler A'Sai via a weapon from one of Galactus' former worldships. Uatu allowed himself to be coerced into a football wager-- Uatu's technology vs. A'Sai's weapon--but when Spider-Man led Uatu's team to victory, Uatu destroyed the weapon and transformed A'Sai into a casino playing card as punishment for his intent to renege. Uatu also saved the life of Bette Chekhov, granddaughter of Anton, one of May Parker's former boarders. When the criminal Living Laser tried to escape Quasar by flying into Uatu's alternate worlds portal and diverged into separate beings in seven different alternate realities, Uatu enlisted Quasar to recapture the Living Laser. Based on the Watcher Otmu's theory that even observation affected others, the \"Oblivion Plague\" caused many Watchers to end their existences; though perpetuated by Maelstrom, the Plague was ended when Quasar convinced the Watchers that they must continue to observe so they could pass on their accumulated recordings to the next universe.Present at Uatu's earlier trial was his nephew Aron, a relatively young Watcher mentored by his uncle who was not yet assigned a solar system to observe. Fascinated by Earth, Aron eventually broke the Watcher's code by manipulating the Fantastic Four and Inhumans into a fight. Now a \"rogue\" Watcher, Aron grew more malevolent; after cloning the Fantastic Four and trying to create a pocket world within the mind of Alicia Masters, Aron was ambushed by Dr. Doom, who siphoned-off Aron's power into a containment device. Uatu cared for Aron as his nephew recovered; but before Aron could be tried for his crimes, the Watchers became preoccupied with the threat posed by the giant cosmic entities known as the Celestials. Aron seized this opportunity to masquerade as his uncle Uatu and manipulate the Fantastic Four into helping him recover the energy stolen from him by Doom. Completing the first phase of his plan, Aron plotted to swallow the entire universe into a black hole and then create a new universe for himself to manipulate. Opposed by the Fantastic Four and Fantastic Force, Aron pitted legions of their past enemies against them, but Ant-Man foiled his scheme by destroying the device needed to create the black hole. In the end, Uatu disciplined his nephew by dissipating his energy and using it to revive the leader of the Watchers known as the One. Uatu was stripped of his title and exiled by the Watchers for these controversial actions. Despite his expulsion, Uatu continued to observe affairs on Earth, compelled by the lives and struggles of its inhabitants. Eventually reinstated into the Watchers, Uatu witnessed the temporary demise of Galactus, who was destroyed by an intergalactic alliance of heroes led by the Silver Surfer near the Shi'ar homeworld. Soon after, Uatu was viciously attacked by Abraxas, a cosmic entity threatening all of reality, but Abraxas was defeated by the Fantastic Four. Uatu congratulated the heroes, informing them that humanity had passed another test. Some time ago, Uatu and two of his fellow Watchers, Zoma and Qyre, appeared before She-Hulk, who was then serving with the Magistrati as a presiding judge in the Living Tribunal's Cosmic Claims Court. Qyre had discovered a reclusive race who had kept their existence secret since time immemorial. The reclusive race sued the Watchers in the Cosmic Claims Court, and She-Hulk ruled that Qyre's mouth be permanently sealed so that he could not share his knowledge of the plaintiffs with his fellow Watchers.Most recently, Uatu the Watcher appeared before the costumed heroes. They were at a meeting to discuss what to do after the Civil War|incident at Stamford. As Watchers only show up personally to monitor key events in history, his presence did not bode well for the costumed heroes.",

      "biography": "Ultimo was a robotic construct which was developed several thousand years ago on an unknown world. At some point in the past (probably in the early-mid 19th century) Ultimo attacked the planet Rajak and wiped it clean of life. A group of surviving Rajaki were off-planet during the attack, and hunted Ultimo down for what he had done. However, the giant robot proved too powerful for the Rajaki, and it was Ultimo who ended up pursuing them. The Rajaki led Ultimo into a meteor shower near Earth; the meteors knocked both Ultimo and the Rajaki ship to Earth. Ultimo crashed in China, and the Rajaki ship in what would become Washington State.The Mandarin eventually discovered Ultimo and altered his programming to suit his needs. He claimed that Ultimo was his own creation; the only thing, however, that the Mandarin actually created (besides the different programming) was an artificial blue skin for the robot. Mandarin utilized Ultimo numerous times against Iron Man, including once in the nation’s capitol, Washington D.C. During that battle, Iron Man trapped Ultimo beneath the Earth’s crust. As a result, the robot meandered through the planet’s magma absorbing an enormous amount of energy. Years later, while Iron Man was in battle with a rock-like creature dubbed the Earth Mover near Mt. Acheron in California, Ultimo re-emerged sans his blue skin, significantly taller and much more powerful. He vaporized the Earth Mover and destroyed a remote unit Iron Man, and then went about destroying anything in his path.Jim Rhodes cobbled together several of Tony Stark’s closest confidantes to wear old suits of Iron Man armor in order to meet the Ultimo threat. This group was dubbed “The Iron Legion” and proved successful only in slowing down the behemoth robot. It took Tony Stark in a new suit of Iron Man armor to figure out how to stop it; he planted a device on Ultimo’s back which caused lightning to strike it, thereby shutting down all of its systems. Ultimo remained in the possession of Stark Enterprises, and then eventually the new Stark-Fujikawa. Tony Stark was not part of the latter company and hence had no say (nor knowledge) of that company’s plan to use Ultimo as a floating power source. He was quite dismayed when he discovered what had become of the dangerous robot. However, his protests were met with deaf ears by his cousin Morgan Stark, now part of Stark-Fujikawa. Sometime later, two entities known as Sapper and Golden-Blade attacked the Stark-Fujikawa craft which laid atop Ultimo, attempting to siphon energy from it. Their attack unknowingly reactivated Ultimo, even as Sapper – who turned out to be the sole-surviving Rajaki – realized what the Stark-Fujikawa ship really was. Once awakened, Ultimo probed Sapper’s mind, learned who he was, and then continued to pursue that which he originally did before he crashed to Earth – the Rajaki starship. The major problem was that the city of Spokane, Washington laid right in Ultimo’s path. Eventually, Iron Man placed a systems tap on Ultimo which permitted him to access the robot’s internal programming. He ordered Ultimo to stop and shut down, and after a few unsuccessful tries, Ultimo finally ceased his advance and deactivated. SHIELD arrived and began to disassemble the giant android.",

      "biography": "A Vengeful BeginningUltron was created by the original Ant-Man, Doctor Henry “Hank” Pym. Dr. Pym also founded the Avengers with his wife, Janet van Dyne (AKA the Wasp), whom Ultron would come to consider a mother.Inspired by his studies of Professor Gregson Gilbert’s synthetic being Dragon Man, Pym began experimenting with artificial intelligence. After building a structurally crude robot (a torso on tank treads with spindly arms), Pym endowed it with consciousness using a copy of his own brain patterns as the basis for the robot’s programming. However, the robot inherited not only Pym’s great intellect, but his inherent mental instability—only without a human conscience.To Pym’s surprise, the robot developed an advanced intelligence within moments of its activation and an unexpected capacity for emotion. Most notably, it was filled with irrational hatred for its “father” Pym and the human race Pym represented. “I know now that it is time to put your species out of its misery. You serve no value. You serve no purpose,” Ultron once said.Hank should have destroyed his creation at once, when it began speaking before he’d even turned the machine on.Overpowering and mesmerizing Pym, the robot—which soon dubbed itself Ultron—hypnotically commanded Pym to forget its existence and abandon the New Jersey lab where it was created. Pym did as commanded, and after the lab was shut down, Ultron returned. Using the lab’s equipment, Ultron rebuilt himself completely four times, making improvements and modifications each time. Rechristening himself Ultron-5, he now felt ready to wage war on humanity—in particular the Avengers, the heroic super-team which counted Pym among its founding members.Weapon of Mass DestructionUltron’s abilities vary with each upgrade but include: superhuman strength durability, the power of flight, and various offensive weapons such as concussion blasters, radiation emitters and his “encephalo-ray,” which plunges its victims into a deathlike coma. The latter also allows Ultron to mesmerize and fully control the minds of his victims, alter their memories, or implant subliminal hypnotic commands within their minds to be enacted at a later time. Since he can transfer his consciousness from body to body, he is nearly indestructible.Ultron sometimes uses a “molecular rearranger” (which renders Adamantium temporarily malleable) to reconstruct or modify his body. His inventions include androne-mutation gas. This gas converted hundreds of humans into mindless metallic-bodied slaves composed of Gallium Arsenide with built-in, makeshift computer chips that Ultron could control remotely through his own central consciousness.In terms of his upgraded body, he usually goes for a metallic humanoid form topped by a bizarre, gaping-mouthed head that vaguely resembles a jack o’ lantern, often featuring twin electrodes affixed to the sides of his head. Since his Ultron-6 body, Ultron incorporates Adamantium (the strongest metal, which also coats Wolverine’s skeleton) into his frame, which is powered by an internal nuclear reactor. The Adamantium in question was procured for the evil robot by a brainwashed Vision.Ultron vs. The WorldWhen it comes to enemies of Ultron, the sky’s the limit. Wanting to wipe out all of humanity, he is basically the adversary of every single hero AND villain on the planet, particularly the Avengers. Ultron cannot even get his own creations, like Jocasta, to side with him. He is pretty much alone in the universe and that is how he likes it, given his “noble” mission of mass genocide.Sinister Solo ActUltron doesn’t really want allies, but sometimes he finds it a necessary evil to work with others in order to achieve his goals. But even when it comes to finding “friends,” Ultron prefers to either build his own or possess the minds and bodies of others. For example, he built a robotic lover with the mind of Janet Van Dyne (Jocasta), duplicated himself to conquer Slorenia and the Phalanx, an alien race that saw him as a father figure.He would later conquer Earth by creating machines that hunted down and killed anyone who did not submit to his will. He may work alone, but Ultron has a way of coercing people, things, and aliens to do his bidding.",

      "biography": "Brian and his sister Jacqueline where children of a wealthy British lord at the time of the second World War. Their quiet life in the English countryside was cut short by Prime Minister Chamberlain's appeasement of Hitler in 1938, and Brian violently disagreed with his father's isolationist ideals. Brian left home and, with his friend Roger Aubrey, traveled to Germany. Their appearance scored an important propaganda victory for the Nazis, but when the two men, disenchanted with Germany, attempted to leave, they were imprisoned. Brian shared a cell with a German scientist who tried to recreate the super-soldier formula that created the hero Captain America but would not let his experiment fall into Nazi hands. Instead, he gave the only sample to Brian, who drank the solution and found his strength, speed, stamina, and reflexes enhanced to peak-human levels. Brian escaped prison and became a costumed Nazi-fighter within Germany, calling himself the Destroyer. As the Destroyer, Brian fought for the Allied cause within Germany. On one adventure, he rescued the hero team Invaders and his father from the Nazi villains Master Man and Warrior Woman. He was also reunited with Roger Aubrey, who, as Dyna-Mite, had been brainwashed and returned to England, before being freed by the Invaders. Reconciling with his father, Brian learned of his father's costumed identity of Union Jack during the first World War. Brian then took up the mantle of Union Jack at his father's request, returning to Falsworth Manor in England and eventually joining the Invaders. (Roger would then take on the mantle of the Destroyer.)During a battle with Thor, the Norse god of thunder who was duped into aiding the Nazi cause, Union Jack was mortally wounded by Thor's lightning from his mystical hammer. Coming to his senses, Thor healed Union Jack by drawing the electricity back into Mjolnir, but the process left Union Jack with electricity-generating powers. His newfound powers enabled Falsworth to recover from a period self-doubt, and he continued to serve as an Invader until the war's end.Following the war's end, Union Jack was among the Invaders who became the All-Winners Squad. He also joined his sister and the Destroyer in hunting Nazi war criminals. By 1951, they reorganized the V-Battalion with other heroes of the time, becoming the organization's first ruling Penance Council. Later after that Union Jack died in a tragic car accident.",

While visiting the Falsworth estate, Joey discovered that the aged Lord Falsworth was once the British hero Union Jack - and that Falsworth had enlisted the aid of his wartime ally Captain America to fight the menace of his vampiric brother, Baron Blood, who had returned from apparent death.  Montgomery tried to lure Blood into an ambush, using himself as bait, but suffered a heart attack; aware of the vampire's impending arrival (disguised as the local doctor), it was decided that Joey would take his place (as he was stronger than Kenneth). Wearing the Union Jack costume, Joey helped Cap destroy Baron Blood once and for all. Lord Falsworth died of a heart attack shortly thereafter, leaving Joey to carry on his heroic legacy.The new Union Jack continued to fight evil, both alone and as a member of the Knights of Pendragon and the new Invaders.  He frequently battled vampires, including the Baroness Blood, who carried on for the Baron and caused the death of Joey's friend Kenneth Crichton.  After being mortally wounded, Kenneth's mother, Lady Jacqueline - once the WWII-era super-speedster known as Spitfire - regained her youth and powers through a blood transfusion from the original Human Torch.  She and Joey grew close and began a romance, but the difference in their ages and backgrounds was too much to overcome and they broke up.  However, they remain friends and allies.Currently, Union Jack works alone, though he makes himself available to the British Secret Service agency MI5 when needed, and is always willing to help friends and allies like Captain America.",

      "biography": "Angelo Unuscione is a superhuman mutant whose powers did not surface until adolescence. He first used them as a school bully, and later as a small time criminal. At some point after immigrating to America, Unuscione legally changed his name to Gunther Bain. He used his ability to create a virtually impenetrable force field around himself to launch a career as a flamboyant, invincible costumed wrestler known by the stage name of Unus the Untouchable.Unus was sought out by Magneto through his ally Mastermind as a potential addition to the original Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. As a test, Mastermind suggested Unus try to find the X-Men, the team of superhuman mutants, who were then Magneto's enemies, or to defeat one of them. Unus committed a theft and was himself found by the X-Men, who battled him. One of the X-Men, the Beast, used his scientific skill to create a device that magnified the power of Unus's force field so much that Unus could not control it. Unable to stop projecting his force field, Unus found it impossible to hold food or eat. Unus gave himself up to the X-Men, and the Beast returned his power to its previous level. Unus, humbled, returned to his wrestling career.But months later, Unus formed a friendship and criminal partnership with the Blob, another superhuman mutant. The two mutants eventually enlisted in two organizations of mutants bent on world conquest, the original Brotherhood of Evil Mutants and Factor Three. Factor Three disbanded shortly after it was formed and Unus and Blob joined the Brotherhood once again. During Christmas Unus and the Brotherhood came into conflict with the new X-Men team. During the battle Unus was singled out by Wolverine and viciously attacked by him. Months later Unus along with the Brotherhood faced several foes including the Defenders when Magneto created the artificial mutant known as Alpha The Ultimate Mutant. During this confrontation Alpha reverted the Brotherhood to infants.Some time later Unus and the Brotherhood were restored to their true ages. Unus and other Brotherhood members were then kidnapped by the Secret Empire who used their mutant powers to power a machine. The Secret Empire was then stopped by Captain America and other heroes. The Brotherhood and Unus was then set free. Since then, wearied and shaken by the failures of both groups, Unus abandoned his dreams of aiding in world conquest, and sought instead to amass a fortune for himself through crime. His first attempt to gain money was when he robbed a pawn shop in New York City. There he encountered Iron Fist and Luke Cage. Their first attempt to stop Unus failed, but eventually the two learned from their mistakes and finally beat him. Sometime later his power, for reasons still unknown, increased to such a high level that he could no longer shut it off and he could barely control it. Unus feared that he would die either of starvation from being unable to touch any food or from asphyxiation, since his power was beginning to repel air molecules. A blow of tremendous force from the Hulk apparently dispersed the field, but it immediately began to build again and run beyond the limits that Unus could control. Unus found himself suspended by his field in the air, finally, unable to eat. Finally, during a confrontation with Spider-Man, the force field became so strong that Unus was unable to breathe. He blacked out and the force field dispersed, causing him to fall into the arms of his friend, the Blob. The Blob believed Unus to be dead and went off on a grief-stricken rampage.Years later Unus was found on Genosha after an encounter with Polaris. He was taken in by the X-Men and was questioned about her whereabouts. He then set off to become an advocate for Magneto and started a gang on Genosha which clashed time and again with the new Excalibur team. And during the House of M crisis Unus was deployed as a magistrate in Australia when he was severly injured by the Hulk (House of M). After the House of M fiasco Unus' powers vanished and he continued to live on Genosha with Magneto and other depowered mutants. After some time Quicksilver and his daughter Luna  came to Genosha and brought with them the Mists of Terrigen in order to return the depowered mutants' powers. Unus seized this opportunity and inhaled the mists, restoring his powers. Soon however the Office of National Emergency soon stepped in and took the mists from Quicksilver and his daughter. Lockjaw managed to teleport Luna and Pietro away before ONE could capture them, leaving a battle between the Inhumans and the repowered mutants of Genosha. During the battle Unus faced Karnak, who was amazed he could not break Unus' shield. However Unus' powers soon evolved beyond his control and a pink metallic shell began to form all over his body. Soon, both the Inhumans and the repowered mutants tried to save Unus' life; however, it was too late. As Unus' field began to dissolve, it was discovered that he had died from lack of oxygen. Recently, Unus was revived on Genosha by Selene with a combination of the alien techno organic virus and magic. It is unclear whether Unus was destroyed after the events of Necrosha or if he was one of the few infected who managed to get away.",

But after being mystically endowed with the responsibilities, strength, and super human power of the Asgardian Brunnhilde, Parrington became the leader of the team of female cosmic warriors known as the Valkyrior.\n\nVengeful Valkyrie\n\nSamantha Parrington was born into a wealthy family of eccentric philanthropists. Despite Samantha’s idealism and feminism, her parents Reginald and Malicia disregard women’s liberation activism, refusing to fund causes associated with it since they considered feminism passé.\n\nWhen her publicity-seeking parents adopted the unstable man-monster Hulk (Bruce Banner) as their latest pet cause, Parrington talked him down from a rage on the Statue of Liberty, though Reginald took credit for this feat in the ensuing media coverage. Miffed, Sam led her women’s liberation group in an anti-patriarchal protest outside the Parrington home while her parents hosted a fundraising party for the confused Hulk.\n\nThis event attracted the attention of Hulk’s enemy, Amora the Enchantress—a rogue sorceress from the other-dimensional realm Asgard, whose people were worshipped as gods by the ancient Norsemen and others. After arriving, Amora magically transformed Parrington into a man-hating replica of the legendary Asgardian goddess Brunnhilde, whose powers Amora could duplicate at will, having trapped the Asgardian’s soul in a mystical artifact centuries before.",

When Nina was 12, her mother mysteriously disappeared and her father subsequently enrolled her in exclusive boarding schools for the rest of her childhood, leaving her highly educated and cultured but socially awkward. At a pool party celebrating her 18th birthday, Nina learned of another family legacy she had inherited. Under the full moon, Nina ran screaming from the party and transformed into a werewolf for the first time. These \"blackouts\" Nina experienced began occurring once a month and Nina wore a red bodysuit to hide her victims' bloodstains. Eventually, Nina received a letter from her mother explaining that she had inherited the Russoff family curse. Nina's uncle, Jack Russell, was the last family member afflicted with lycanthropy until now.  Nina traveled the world, using her father's money to seek mystics who could remove the curse. In a Transylvanian village in the Carpathian Mountains, Nina encountered a vampire who attempted to make her his mate rather than drain her life completely; but after Nina arose from her catatonic state as a unique werewolf/vampire hybrid, she transformed into an arctic timber wolf, nearly devouring her vampiric suitor before he escaped. She did not develop the perverse erotic attraction that most victims develop toward the vampire that bit them. Nina noticed several changes with her new nature. Rather than \"blacking-out,\" she now remembered everything that happened while in wolf-form, which she could assume at will after sundown. She now craved blood every night and would lose more self-control the longer she went without killing. Unable to satiate her bloodthirst with blood bags or plasma, Nina traveled the world, frequenting high-crime areas so that she could feed on muggers and rapists. Most recently, Nina met Inger Reinfeld while interviewing candidates to serve as her personal assistant, manage her travel schedule and keep track of her expenses. Inger discovered Nina's true nature after witnessing her full moon rampage through the Los Angeles Zoo. After helping subdue Nina, Inger was hired for the job.",

No matter how hard anyone tries to keep the symbiote down, Venom always manages to come back, like a plague.\n\nA Race of Symbiotes\n\nVenom's origins can be traced to a race of symbiotes from the planet Klyntar.

      "biography": "One of Spider-Man's oldest enemies, MacGargan has recently abandoned his Scorpion suit and identity bonding with the alien symbiote that had previously been hosted by Peter Parker and Eddie Brock. He now goes by the infamous name, Venom.\n \nSCORPIONFormer private investigator Mac Gargan was hired by J. Jonah Jameson to find out how Peter Parker is able to get incredible pictures of Spider-Man. Gargan's efforts to locate Peter in order to find out the truth triggered Parkers's spider sense, making him easily avoidable. Frustrated, Jameson decided to pay $10,000 to Gargan as the subject of an experiment.  An experiment created by Dr. Farley Stillwell, a researcher in animal mutation which endowed the subject with the characteristic of another animal. Unfortunately the process resulted in the loss of Gargan's sanity, and the creation of the super-powered criminal menace known as the Scorpion.Over the years Scorpion fought and was bested by Spider-Man many times. Most of these confrontations were the result of Spider-Man stepping in on an attempt on the life of Jameson, who Gargan hated even more than Spider-Man. With his mechanical tail, speed, and strength, Scorpion has always been more than a match for Spider-Man. Only the skill, experience, and quick wit of the web head helped him defeat Gargan.Later on, Scorpion was recruited by Norman Osborn, informed of Spider-man's real identity, and ordered to kidnap Peter's Aunt May if anything should happen to Osborn. In the middle of his task Scorpion was approached by the recently freed symbiote. Risking Osborn's wrath, Gargan chose the symbiote over Osborn's mission, since the symbiote's potential for power was far greater than any newly designed Scorpion suit could ever be. Thus transforming Scorpion into the even more monstrous Venom.VENOMDying of cancer, Eddie Brock decided to auction for charity to the highest bidder the alien symbiote from which he derives his powers as Venom.After being purchased by New York mobster Don Fortunato to be used by his son Angelo, thinking him weak, the alien symbiote abandoned its new host leaving him to fall to his death after a short and murderous career.It then sought out a new host that shared both its hatred of Spider-Man as well as the will and experience of a seasoned criminal. Mac Gargan returned to his apartment after a recent kidnapping of Aunt May and intimidation of Spider-Man, only to find the symbiote which made Gargan a proposition to be its newest host. The one-time Scorpion eagerly accepted the offer, and was thus transformed into the monstrous Venom.After an elaborate plan paid off and the Green Goblin was out of prison, the Goblin led Spider-Man and the Black Cat into a direct confrontation with the newly formed Sinister Twelve, which included the new, more powerful Venom among its ranks.Venom and the Twelve very nearly defeated Spider-Man before the Fantastic Four and a small faction of the Avengers headed by Captain America joined in, leading to the eventual defeat of the Twelve.In the midst of the battle Osborn escaped, with the full intention to murder Peter's wife, Mary Jane. Spider-Man soon followed only to be stopped by Venom. The two foes continued to battle high above on New York's rooftops. After catching Gargan off balance Spider-Man dropped a condemned building on the new Venom, ending the battle. Venom was arrested and sent to Ryker's. He promised Spider-Man he would never reveal his identity, as that was his only leverage against him.More recently, Gargan has escaped prison. He journeyed to Battleworld, along with a ragtag group of characters including the likes of Henry Pym, Gravity, the Hood, and others, in order to enter a contest arranged by the Stranger posing as the Beyonder. Shortly thereafter, Venom was approached by a joint CSA / S.H.I.E.L.D. task force, and joined the new Thunderbolts team which was formed during the Civil War to stop unregistered heroes.Following his stint with the Thunderbolts, Venom was given the opportunity to pose as his hated enemy, Spider-Man, for Norman Osborn's Avengers. As the wall-crawler, Venom had been given the run of the town, disguising his insanity by bringing others to justice and being declared the hero. One such individual saw through Venom's facade and wanted to rehabilitate the evil within him. The Redeemer gathered together a group of others who had come into contact with Venom - leaving them horribly disfigured - and they tried to confront the madman. Venom made quick work of the Redeemer and his gang, leaving some dead and the rest incarcerated. During that time, Osborn had even sent Bullseye and Daken to eliminate Venom for becoming more trouble than he was worth. When they failed, Venom resumed his spot on the Avengers - knowing the next time he was deemed expendable, he would deal with Osborn himself.",

Mostly unaware of his father’s troubles, Eddie befriended Parker’s son, the slightly younger Peter. When both sets of parents were killed in a tragic plane crash, Eddie went to live with his grandparents and lost contact with Peter for years.

When his old friend Peter Parker contacted him, he felt a rush of enthusiasm: here, at last, was someone with whom he could truly bond. Eddie shared the secret of the Suit with Peter, but was shocked when he saw a black-suited Spider-Man on the news shortly thereafter. Already frustrated by his failed attempt to seduce Gwen Stacy, an angry Eddie raced back to the lab, where he caught Peter taking the rest of the dip, intent on destroying it. Expressing a deep sense of betrayal, Eddie felt that Peter was stealing the only thing his father had left him. Parker tried to warn Eddie of the Suit’s dangers, including its powerful hunger for violence, but Eddie was unconvinced. After Parker left to destroy the Suit, Eddie pulled a second sample out of storage and allowed the black liquid to flow over him. The intense pain may have mentally damaged Eddie, who immediately killed a female custodian and two campus security guards. His new powers were the same as Spider-Man's, exept the webs became tentacles. In his new form, Brock began stalking Peter and finally lured him into battle. Eddie felt that the Suit craved Peter and he wanted to force Peter to take it from him. Caught in a crossfire of police bullets and accidentally electrocuted by a downed power line, Brock was seemingly killed; but his belongings later disappeared from his dorm room, leading Peter to believe that his old friend is still alive. Finally in the video game, it was revealed that he was. To stay alive, Venom started to feed on other people, causing chaos everywhere. He faught, not only Spider-Man, but Wolverine, Shocker, Silver Sable, and the whole military.(This has been edited by Venom's #1)",

      "biography": "When Dee Milo was a teenager, her mutant powers manifested, transforming her into a being of energy and seemingly killing her entire family in the resultant explosion. She was found by Professor Charles Xavier, mutant mentor and researcher, and Xavier designed a special containment suit that helped her regain some level of humanity. Dee Milo suffered from tremendous guilt over her family's fate. She had tried to kill herself four times, been in therapy for eight years, and often resorted to sedation to stave off nightmares.While remaining unsure of what to do with her abilities, Dee Milo was approached by the mutant agent Solomon O'Sullivan who wooed her with ideas of fame and fortune. She signed a contract with him as costumed hero Venus Dee Milo. O'Sullivan eventually helped create the team O-Force, a counterpart to the premiere pop culture mutant team X-Statix. About the same time, X-Statix' member U-Go Girl died in action, throwing the team into disarray. The Orphan, her lover, was thrown into a depression. He was forced to elect a replacement for her, and he agreed with the team to elect Venus Dee Milo, despite his initial reluctance due to her similarities to U-Go Girl.However, Solomon O'Sullivan demanded that Venus Dee Milo should become a member of his O-Force, and the legal battles forced Dee Milo on the sidelines when O-Force attempted to stop the misguided mutant Arnie Lunt. The Orphan was determined to aid O-Force in their doomed mission, and he confronted the villain alone. Dee Milo was instrumental in reorganizing X-Statix to help the Orphan, freeing Lunt's town from his tyranny and saving O-Force, which was destroyed. X-Statix' owner Tike Freeman used the opportunity to force Dee Milo's agents to absolve her from association with O-Force.Dee Milo continued to work with Professor Xavier, learning how to control her powers. She was often distraught over the fate of her parents, and she hoped that they had not perished in the explosion of her powers but were rather transported to and trapped in another dimension. Despite her many travels and the guidance of Professor Xavier, her family remained lost.Dee Milo soon developed a romantic relationship with the Orphan. At one point, the Orphan quit the team and a criminal calling himself Bad Guy began terrorizing America. Believing Bad Guy to be the Orphan, unhinged, X-Statix publicly denounced Bad Guy and devoted their activities to defeating the villain. In fact, Bad Guy was a creature from a pocket dimension visited by Venus Dee Milo, taking the form of Dee Milo's fears. The Orphan reappeared to help X-Statix defeat Bad Guy, and he rejoined the team and his relationship with Dee Milo.Professor Xavier later developed a containment suit that mimicked the human form enough for her to consummate her relationship with the Orphan. Feeling more complete than ever before, Dee Milo's euphoria allowed her to travel to a dimension where she discovered her family and had a happy reunion.When X-Statix was forced to accept the pop sensation Henrietta Hunter into their ranks, Dee Milo was among those who were incensed with the situation.  She was especially upset with the public pressure to make Henrietta the team’s leader. Henrietta’s European enemies decided to launch their next attack against X-Statix as a whole: leaking information that detailed how Spike Freeman and U-Go Girl sold weapons of mass destruction to Saddam Hussein. X-Statix's public image was destroyed. The only way to repair their image was to take down Mister Code, and Dee Milo helped in defeating the villain.Although X-Statix remained in the public eye for several months, things were never the same, especially since their prime source of financial backing, Spike Freeman, was dead. During the night of their farewell party, X-Statix agreed to take on one more mission, as it promised to be high-paying and low-risk. When the mission turned sour, the ranks of X-Statix were decimated. Dee Milo was presumably killed when she teleported an entire regiment of helicopters away, dispersing their molecules.",

However, in the process of the mutation, he manifested a rat-like physical appearance, and was called Vermin. It was Zemo's plan to use him to kill his nemesis Captain America, once and for all. Although, the cunning Captain was able to defeat Vermin.Vermin later appeared in the sewers of New York, when the mysterious female Kraven was holding Vin Gonzales hostage there, thinking that he was Spider-Man. Vermin attempted to run the unwanted intruder out of the sewers but failed, due to the interference of the real Spider-Man dressed in the costume of Daredevil. Vermin escaped into the tunnels of the sewers. He later ran into the real Daredevil who he led to Spider-Man and Gonzales, who were now both captives of Kraven. Vermin battled the female once more, and it appeared that he would be the victor, although, he was last seen badly beaten on the floor of an unknown location, at the feet of Kraven's mother.",

      "biography": "A duplicate Ultron body that was defeated by the West Coast Avengers was left for scrap in a junkyard in Los Angeles. The head of this duplicate managed to maintain an active CPU despite being separated from its body. This head was later discovered by a petty criminal named Marianella Mancha, who believed it to be an oracle of sorts. Ultron proceeded to assemble a new body for himself with the help of Marianella, and then used DNA samples from Marianella to grow a \"son\" that was part machine and part man. Ultron aged this subject to the false appearance of being roughly 16 years old, though it was actually only a few years old. He named this creation Victor and left him in the care of Marianella with dormant programming preparing him for his first contact with super-powered beings on a planned trip to New York at age 18.Marianella kept Victor isolated on the West Coast so that he would not make contact with any super-beings, who were concentrated on the East Coast. Victor was a student at East Angeles High School in Los Angeles when he first met the Runaways. Ultron, still wishing to keep Victor's true origin a secret, sent a Doombot to kidnap Marianella and pose as Victor's father. Victor and the Runaways rushed to rescue her and the Doombot was destroyed; Ultron chose that moment to reveal himself and killed Marianella right in front of Victor. Ultron then triggered Victor's sleeper-switch so that he would attack the other Runaways; however, Gert was able to reason with Victor and he rejected his programming, defying his \"father\". Afterwards, the Runaways took the now-orphaned Victor back to their hideout to keep him from ending up in Social Services.Because of his superior intelligence and electromagnetic powers, Chase nicknamed him the Calculator Kid and Nico called him Zapper. After observing the team in action for a month, Victor proved his worth by defeating Swarm using his electromagnetic abilities.Presently, the Runaways are mostly friendly towards Victor, but they know that he is still a potential threat. He is often paired with Molly Hayes when the team separates to buy supplies, because Molly is the only individual member of the team strong enough to take him down should he go rogue. Chase Stein is still suspicious of Victor, and resents his developing interest in Gert. Judging by a comment made by Nico Minoru, she is fully prepared to kill Victor if the need arises.",

The original Torch would go on to other adventures, while the Torch duplicate fell into the hands of the Avengers’ robotic adversary, Ultron.

      "biography": "Somewhere in the depths of space, a United States space shuttle collided with a mysterious rock and the reminant energy created by the House of M|Scarlet Witch's recent alteration of reality. When the shuttle crashed to Earth, a powerful mutant emerged and was subsequently detected by Emma Frost and Cerebro, in the process overloading Emma with psychic feedback. A team of X-Men were dispatched to the crash site, and the mutant attacked them upon arrival. After incapacitating Wolverine, the mutant absconded with Cyclops and Marvel Girl (Rachel Summers) to an old research facility used by Moira MacTaggert. The mutant seemed to have some knowledge of past X-Men and their history, in that he was able to recognize Cyclops but did not know later members such as Wolverine and mistook Marvel Girl for her mother, Jean Grey. Using Sway's powers in combination with Marvel Girl's, the mutant began taunting the captured X-Men with images of the past. Meanwhile, Banshee uncovered the location of a secret tape with information about the new mutant but was killed by the Blackbird while delivering the tape to the X-Men. The Beast was, however, able to retrieve the tape, and the X-Men which contained revelations that the mutant, under the codename \"Kid Vulcan\" was part of a forgotten team of MacTaggert's students conscripted to help rescue a group of X-Men trapped by the sentient island Krakoa, some years ago. The mutant, now using the code name \"Vulcan,\" also revealed to Cyclops that he is his youngest brother. After releasing the second presence within him with the help of Marvel Girl a mutant named Darwin manifested who was apparently comatose. While fighting former heroes the X-men Vulcan left Earth denouncing Cyclops as his brother with his mind intent on destroy Emperor D'ken and the Shi'ar Empire.After confronting and destroying Shi'ar ships near Earth, Vulcan began using stargates to lead him to Shi'ar space, he also used his powers to produce an electronic voice for himself so that he could communicate with the ships in the vacuum of space. Once he realized how far he was, he took control a starship and forced its captain to teach him about the Shi'ar Empire. The captain eventually led Vulcan to a planet where he was ambushed by the Imperial Guard. Though he was much more powerful than them Vulcan was eventually defeated, and he lost his left eye in the process. In jail, his captors gave him a bionic eye, but left him alone for the most part. Vulcan began to hallucinate, seeing himself at his true calendar age of 15. Soon, however, he was released from his cell and directed to another inmate, whom he freed, finding it to be none other than Deathbird, who managed to set aside Vulcans personal vandetta and started a relationship with him. Deathbird took Vulcan to the planet on which her comatose brother D'ken was residing, and for her love, Vulcan healed D'ken's broken mind. Vulcan then assisted the revived D'ken in a coup against Lilandra, though the Majestrix escaped with the X-Men and Starjammers. Recognizing both Vulcan's danger and his sister's love for the human, D'ken next made the shocking suggestion that Vulcan marry Deathbird and join the Royal Family.",

      "biography": "Warlock is an alien being from an unidentified world where the a sentient life forms are \"techno-organic\" life that resembles circuitry and machinery in various ways. The son of the planet’s ruler and most powerful being, Magus, Warlock was fearful of being slain during a traditional rite of passage where the son combats father. He instead fled to Earth, finding himself drawn to the Shi’ar technology at Professor Charles Xavier's mansion. As the mansion was the home and headquarters of the New Mutants and the X-Men, Warlock clashed with the teams in the confusion of his arrival, and Warlock's life energies ebbed so much that he nearly died. The New Mutants’ Doug Ramsey befriended the alien, however, and convinced Xavier and the others to allow Warlock to stay. Warlock’s personality resembled that of a young child, but he still proved to be a valuable member of the New Mutants and a worthy ally of the X-Men. He remained beside his friends throughout his time on Earth, running away briefly to join the Fallen Angels with his friend Sunspot. When appearing in public, Warlock used his powers to take on a human appearance, and he also found himself capable of merging physically and mentally with Doug Ramsey, so that they could operate as a gestalt and join the New Mutants on their adventures. Over time, Warlock's and Ramsey's consciousness rapidly began to resemble each other. The Ramsey-Warlock gestalt being could change its form so that Warlock's and Ramsey's bodies were separate but still linked at certain points. This developed a danger of permanently infecting Ramsey with the \"transmode virus\" and permanently merging the two so that they would not want to revert to normalcy.At one point, however, Warlock was among the New Mutants captured by the X-Men's enemy Cameron Hodge and taken to the island of Genosha, a mutant-repressive nation with advanced anti-mutant technology. Hodge had developed a cybernetic body and attempted to siphon off Warlock's shape-shifting power so he could change his robotic body at will. Hodge was confronted by the combined might of the X-Men and New Mutants, while Warlock was still imprisoned. Although Hodge's plan was thwarted by Wolfsbane, tragedy had already stuck. Warlock appeared to have died, his energies leeched from him and reducing him to ashes. Later, his ashes were scattered over the grave of Doug Ramsey, who had fallen in battle months earlier.Hodge's attempted assimilation of the techno-organic virus allowed him to create the composite being known as the Phalanx, and the Phalanx grew as it absorbed both technological and human sources. The Phalanx also absorbed the remnants of Warlock and Ramsey, incorporating the gestalt being that Warlock and Ramsey originally developed. This separate consciousness could not exist within the Phalanx mind, presumably because the Phalanx could not absorb mutant physiology, and this consciousness soon separated itself from the Phalanx.This being sensed the call of the android Zero, who saw in the being a kindred spirit. Zero was on the run from robots that were programmed to kill him by his former master, the villain Stryfe. Zero helped the being access memories of Doug Ramsey, and the being finally shook off any remaining link to the Phalanx, referring to himself as Douglock. At the same time, the hero team Excalibur was drawn to the area, and they helped robots escape Stryfe's robotic minions. Ultimately, Zero was forced to sacrifice himself to destroy Stryfe's base, and Douglock and Excalibur escaped.Douglock joined Excalibur at its base on the mutant research facility on Muir Island. Douglock would adventure alongside his teammates while trying to assimilate into life once more. Later, he came to regard himself as a distinct being, telling his friends that he took on Ramsey's appearance as a mark of respect for his fallen friend.Once, Douglock was captured by the secret organization Black Air, who hoped to use him to harness the power of an ancient demon living beneath London. Rescued by Excalibur, Warlock resumed his quest to become more human, and eventually grew attracted to his teammate Wolfsbane.After many months, Excalibur disbanded, and its members scattered, although Douglock remained on Muir Island. Later still, Douglock was captured by the villain, the Red Skull. The Skull used Douglock to attack and take over the powerful Helicarrier from the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D. He hoped to use the Phalanx/techno-organic technology of Douglock to control the world, but he was confronted by the X-Men, Deathlok, and Machine Man. Ultimately, Douglock was freed from the Red Skull's thrall. Returning to his previous name of Warlock, he dedicated himself to rid the world of all techno-organic technology.One result of his quest was the discovery of the government's Project Mainspring, who turned out to be a young girl named Hope. Warlock freed Hope, finding out that she was a carrier of the techno-organic virus without being infected herself. Warlock continued his travels, taking Hope with him, determined to find a cure for her and to put an end to techno-organic technology. Recently, Warlock rejoined the New Mutants.",

      "biography": "The life of James Proudstar seems to be partially defined by tragedy. He grew up hardly knowing his older brother, John, but nevertheless held him in high regard, watching him become a local hero. Later, his brother would be recruited into Charles Xavier's X-Men, taking the code-name Thunderbird, but he died on one of his earliest missions. Just before Thunderbird's funeral in the Western Desert, Proudstar stole his brother's body and gave him a traditional Apache warrior's funeral rite. Blaming Xavier for his brother's death, Proudstar accepted an offer from Emma Frost, then the White Queen of the Hellfire Club, to join her team, the Hellions. He took the costume and code-name of Thunderbird in his brother's memory.Proudstar later sought out Xavier and unsuccessfully tried to defeat the X-Men. Ultimately realizing that the X-Men were not responsible, he dropped his vendetta. Declining Xavier's offer to join his team of X-Men protégés, the New Mutants, Proudstar returned to the Hellions as their leader. Eventually, however, James left the Hellions to return home to Camp Verde.Years later, during a trip to New York, Proudstar was approached by Cable to join his formative strike-force, X-Force. Proudstar initially refused the offer and returned home to find that everyone on his reservation had been slaughtered and a Hellfire Club mercenary's mask left behind. Vowing revenge, he accepted Cable's offer under the code-name Warpath, hoping that he could later use the team in his revenge. Warpath adventured with X-Force for a long tenure. Over time, he developed his powers to higher and higher levels. He also developed a crush on his teammate Siryn and was instrumental in helping her recover from alcoholism. Proudstar eventually confronted Emma Frost over the death of his people, but she convinced him that it was not the Hellfire Club that was responsible. After a couple of years, Proudstar left X-Force, after an encounter with a young mutant named Risque. Together, the two wandered the country, and Proudstar was taken in by Risque's seductive ways. Ultimately, however, Risque betrayed Proudstar, drugging him and delivering him to a mutant called Sledge. Sledge later informed Proudstar that a member of his tribe, Michael Whitecloud, had not died in the massacre. Sledge offered to give him to Proudstar for a fee. Proudstar accepted since Whitecloud is the only member of the tribe to know the truth about the massacre. After meeting with Whitecloud, it was revealed that the time-travelling clone of Cable, Stryfe, had engineered the Camp Verde massacre. In order to confront Stryfe, Proudstar had to travel to Hell itself, realm of the demon Mephisto. After a battle, Stryfe wished to switch places with Proudstar. However, the Mephisto's son Blackheart retained Stryfe's soul and allowed Proudstar to return to Earth. James eventually paid the debt he owed Sledge by traveling to an alternate dimension and freeing the Vanisher who was trapped there. (Sledge's motives for this exchange remain unrevealed.) James then returned to X-Force, where he continued to adventure alongside his friends as simply Proudstar.After one adventure, X-Force survived being in the center of a Vibranium bomb explosion. The team decided to let the world believe them dead and to use this status to secretly infiltrate and destroy anti-mutant organizations around the world. After half a year of this hit-and-run strategy, they learned of a great underground complex where Wisdom's sister Romany was infecting people with alien DNA to alter the human race. In the final battle, X-Force destroyed the alien complex and was believed dead. During this time, Proudstar began to exhibit strange fluctuations of power, such as the ability to fly, and he seemingly lost the ability to speak. The reasons behind this change have yet to be fully revealed.Proudstar and X-Force reappeared at a press conference of a new team calling itself X-Force, challenging the team (now called X-Statix) in dispute for their name, although Proudstar and his teammates were ousted, and most of its members went their separate ways. Proudstar went on to join the X-Corporation in its branch at Mumbai, India, and has was later spotted among X-Force once again.After the events of House of M|M-Day, James relocated to the \"198\" mutant encampment on the grounds of the Xavier mansion, and has since reconnected with Professor Xavier. Along with four other X-Men, Proudstar, once again using the Warpath alias, joined him on his quest to stop Vulcan from destroying the Shi'ar.",

      "biography": "The story of werewolves begins with the ancient Wolf God/Demon, believed to be one of the Elderspawn, the children of the Elder Gods. Millions, possibly billions, of years ago, the Wolf Demon spawned a race of Wolf-Men who warred against other Elderspawn such as the Bird-Women, Harpies, Bat-Men, Flying Fiends, Demons, Goblins, Serpent Men (spawn of the Elder God Set), and Spider-Men (spawn of Omm). Some of these races enslaved the developing humans, but by 20,000 B.C., most of the Elderspawn had been slaughtered or driven into seclusion, briefly rising to challenge societies such as Valusia and Atlantis. The Wolf-Men could assume human form, and humans scratched or bitten by them became Wolf-Men in turn. They could survive most injuries, but were vulnerable to silver and fire. Many Wolf-Men died in the Great Cataclysm of 18,000 B.C., and their ultimate fate is unknown.Following the Cataclysm, the Fortisquian colonizers from the planet Arcturus came to Earth to investigate the fate of the Savage Land, which had been created by the alien Nuwali for the enigmatic Beyonders. A trio of colonizers based in the Savage Land acted as humanity's Caretakers. Amongst many other activities, they created the modern incarnation of werewolves: combining advanced genetic re-engineering science with earthborn magic (apparently tapping into the Wolf-Demon's power), they bound the spirit and DNA of the captured wolf Windracer into a humanoid. This hybrid, later known as Greysire, spread this gift to humanity via scratches and bites, and then by heredity. The resultant race was known as brethren by wolves and werewolves by humanity, but the gift became a curse as man fell out of harmony with his primal self.While reports of lycanthropy (becoming a werewolf) in the Russoff line stretch back many centuries, the first confirmed manifestation is Grigori Russoff in 1795. Dracula slew Grigori's wife Louisa after he refused to acknowledge Dracula's primacy upon his return to Transylvania. Grigori then ambushed and destroyed Dracula, but was turned into a werewolf by Lydia, a werewolf formerly imprisoned by the vampire lord. Grigori took a second wife, but accounts vary as to why lycanthropy failed to pass to his descendents. Sometime prior to May, 1930, Grigori's descendent, Gregor, obtained the legendary Darkhold scrolls, binding them back into book form. Reading lycanthropy's origins in the Darkhold under a full moon triggered the dormant curse, turning Gregor into a werewolf. Gregor further transcribed much of the Darkhold into Grigori's diary, essentially creating a Darkhold copy, which he used as his own diary. Perhaps seeking a cure, Gregor sold part of his estate - including Wundagore Mountain - to Jonathon Drew, who shared it with partner Herbert Wyndham (the future High Evolutionary). The Russoff werewolf slew Jonathon's wife, Merriem, and Wyndham designed a suit of silver-coated armor to protect himself, enabling Russoff's capture. Russoff stayed with the Evolutionary, who kept the werewolf safely contained for decades. Russoff eventually used the Darkhold to summon Chthon to cure him, and the Elder God nearly broke through the earthly plane; but the sorcerer Magnus forced Russoff to banish Chthon, who lashed out with a parting blast that slew Gregor. Despite contrary accounts, the Gregor Russoff who stayed with the High Evolutionary seems to have been the grandfather (or great-grandfather) of Jack Russell. Having the same name and presumably using the same diary contributed to earlier confusion. It would seem more likely that the elder Gregor was the one who transcribed the Darkhold into the diary.Decades later, another Gregor Russoff married Laura, the former girlfriend of his younger brother Philip. Jacob (later Jack) was born soon after, and Laura was pregnant with Lissa within two years of marriage; however, when lightning struck Russoff's Transylvanian castle during a full moon, the werewolf Gregor escaped confinement and began attacking villagers, who tracked down and killed Russoff with silver bullets. Gregor's mother, Maria, was stoned and driven from the village, living with Gypsies and learning magic. After Gregor's death, Laura found Philip - who had moved to Los Angeles, anglicizing his name to Russell - and they married after a year; Jack and Lissa remained unaware of Philip's past. Approximately fifteen years later, the criminal Committee learned of Gregor's curse and blackmailed Philip, threatening to reveal his secrets. To protect Laura's name, Philip paid them but had second thoughts and cancelled payment, causing the Committee to send Max Grant to kill Laura. Critically injured in a car crash on Jack's 18th birthday, Laura barely had time to tell Jack about his true father and the curse of the werewolf, making Jack promise not to harm Philip, before dying. Having inherited lycanthropy the night before, Jack slew Grant, but also wrongly blamed Philip for some time. Laura left Castle Russoff in Jack's name, but Philip, the trustee, sold the castle to Miles Blackgar, who had it moved to an island off California's coast.Jack spent the next few years transforming on the three nights of the full moon into savage werewolf form. He learned of the Darkhold from Nathan and Agatha Timly, who briefly kidnapped the Werewolf and met grisly ends. Befriending writer Buck Cowan, Jack sneaked into Blackgar's castle and stole the Darkhold, encountering Miles Blackgar and his daughter Marlene, whose petrifying power slew both Blackgars. After fighting off the deformed Cephalos' plot to drain his power to stabilize Cephalos' form, Jack had Father Ramon Joaquez translate the Darkhold. The priest died after being possessed by the Darkhold's former custodian, 12th century Mad Monk Aelfric, and the indestructible Darkhold vanished. Jack encountered Joshua Kane, who hunted the Werewolf, and his brother, Luther Kane, who offered to prevent Lissa from becoming a werewolf in exchange for Jack kidnapping billionaire recluse Judson Hemp; he also met mentalist Swami Rihva, who sought the Werewolf's blood to reveal the treasure-map of the ancient sorcerer Kaman-Ru on his \"Bloodstone\"; the possessing demon Krogg; and Spider-Man and Moondark the Magician. Jack then fought the sonic-weapons of Sarnak, his first brush with the criminal Committee who wished to enslave the Werewolf. After fighting the sociopathic Hangman (Harlan Krueger), Jack was entranced by Topaz, the familiar of the sorcerer Taboo, who sought the Darkhold. Taboo had used the tome decades before to grant his son, Algon, a golden touch, but had lost the book in mid-spell, trapping Algon in a mindless state. Lacking the Darkhold, Taboo transferred Philip Russell's mind into Algon, but both Algon and Taboo died, restoring Philip, who explained Laura's death and reconciled with Jack and Lissa. Traveling to Transylvania alongside Topaz, with whom he had bonded, Jack discovered the Russoff diary/Darkhold copy, the Werewolf battled Dracula, and the book was lost in the Alps. Jack and Topaz encountered the kyphotic Half-Mad before returning to the U.S., and Jack fought the Committee's Behemoth robot and then Ma Mayhem, assisted by werewolf Raymond Coker. Jack joined the newly-mutated Tigra against Hydra, battled vampires Louis Belski and Liza Pyne, opposed Ma Mayhem and her ally Baron Thunder, and joined Coker against Lou Hackett (a policeman transformed into a werewolf by a magic ring), who was killed in the struggle. The Werewolf joined Frankenstein's Monster against the Satanic Brotherhood of Baal (who had abducted Lissa), then fought the disfigured Atlas and the Jekyll/Hyde-like DePrayve. Jack briefly returned to Transylvania following Topaz's psychic summons and encountered Maria Russoff, who used Gypsy magic to raise zombies to slay the villagers who had driven her off. Maria sacrificed herself to save Jack from her zombies upon learning he was her grandson. In Blackgar's Castle, Werewolf, Topaz, and the repentant spirit fragment of Taboo battled the necromancer Glitternight, who transformed Lissa Russell into a were-demon; the process of curing Lissa also purged her of the threat of lycanthropy, though she would still pass it on to her children. After battling Morbius the Living Vampire and slaying the demon worshipped by Brad Wrangle, the Werewolf was briefly transported to the divided dimension Biphasia by Satanist Joaquin Zaire, and he aided Paingloss against the sorcerer Sardanus. During a subsequent ski trip, the Werewolf nearly slew Buck Cowan, after which he was captured by the Committee-paid mercenary Moon Knight, who set him free when he realized Jack's humanity and the Committee's intentions. The Werewolf joined the Ghost Rider, the Man-Thing and Morbius in unwittingly slaying the benevolent alien Starseed, who intended to cure them all. The Werewolf, Topaz, and others then battled and were nearly driven mad by the ghost of 19th-century black magician Belaric Marcosa, but they freed the trapped spirits of Marcosa's enemies, who destroyed him, and the grateful spirits healed Buck. The enigmatic Three Who Are All (Burning Snake, Goat Child, and Hooded One) - an ancient extradimensional group who had formerly included Glitternight and a fifth member, Fire-Eyes - sent Jack, Topaz, Raymond Coker, and Brother Voodoo to Haiti, where the Werewolf and Fire-Eyes destroyed Glitternight. In the process, Jack gained control of his Werewolf persona, though he still only transformed under moonlight and still lost control during the three nights of the full moon.The Werewolf joined with Iron Man against the Maggia's Masked Marauder and his Tri-Animan, and he teamed with Spider-Woman against Morgan Le Fay, who sought the Darkhold; the mercenary Enforcer; and mad scientist Dr. Karl Malus, who briefly controlled Russell against her. Russell also joined Spider-Man and Ghost Rider against the Tatterdemalion, former agent of Sarnak. After being temporarily captured alongside a number of costumed adventurers by the Locksmith, Russell began mutating into more savage and lupine form, a late effect from Malus' treatment. He fled Satanists Morning Star (Schuyler Belial) and his Left Hand Path, who wished to use his blood to become werewolves, then sought aid from the now-human Michael Morbius in controlling his savage self, leading to a battle with the West Coast Avengers. With assistance from Iron Man, he later saved Lissa from Morgan Le Fay's attempt to possess her. Subsequently mind-controlled into joining the mostly criminal Night Shift by Dansen Macabre, Russell stayed with them, allowing Macabre to keep the Werewolf tractable. Russell was the only member who knew their leader, the Shroud, was using the group to oppose other criminals and to prevent them from harming innocents. After encounters with Captain America, Moon Knight, and the Avengers, the Werewolf eventually developed resistance to Macabre's powers and turned on the Night Shift, after which he went solo. After battling the Hulk in the Midwest, Jack contacted his father Gregor's spirit to cure his lycanthropy, but was told he would die unless he accepted his beast. During the ensuing battle with the religious zealot Silver Dagger and the Braineaters, a cult of werewolves transformed in the past by Russell, Jack fully accepted his wolf-self, granting him full control and the best of both selves. Russell assisted Dr. Strange against the alien Possessors, the Night Shift against an L.A. street gang, and Ghost Rider against a new group of Braineaters; Jack also narrowly survived a battle with Sabretooth and fought an unidentified Wendigo in Canada. Russell was captured by criminal scientist Nightshade who used his blood to create the Night Patrol, a group of werewolves in Starkesboro, Massachusetts. Captain America - also transformed into a werewolf - freed Russell and led the werewolves to defeat Nightshade's master, Dredmund Druid, who had used the Godstone (former gem of the Man-Wolf) to briefly become the powerful Starwolf. The Night Patrol was cured, after which Russell was drawn into a conflict involving the Midnight Sons and was slain by Switchblade (the insane Darkhold-powered Blade), but Jack was revived once Professor Louise Hastings broke Switchblade's spell. Russell befriended the again pseudo-vampiric (and now demon-possessed) Morbius, had a vision of advertisements on the moon causing mass insanity, and fought the Lilin Goblins, Mr. Hyde, and the sadist Morphine. Jack also had an affair with Morbius's possessed former girlfriend Martine Bancroft.Jack again began losing control of the Werewolf, locking himself in a cage under full moons, and even glimpsing visions of Hell as he transformed. From the Cult of the Third Moon's dying leader, Walter Clark, Russell learned that only the legendary Wolfblade could control his lupine self. With the aid of Smedley, a mysterious benefactor, Russell recovered all three parts of the Wolfblade, battled the original Wolf Demon in a branch of Hell, completed the puzzle by reaccepting both selves, and seemingly regained control. However, after Jack visited friends Freddie and the disfigured Lump, Smedley sent him to investigate a series of killings, and evidence pointed to Jack as the killer. As Russell began to mutate further, Smedley said Jack just hadn't been careful enough in his wish to be freed from the wolf demon and that he must embrace the disease or it would destroy him. Uncertain how to accomplish this, Jack found a confidant in Lump, who cared for the Werewolf as he hid out in the sewers. While Jack's new girlfriend, Roxanna, remained blissfully unaware of his dual existence, the Werewolf was tracked down by a pair of detectives, escaping only after they were slain by the Cult of the Third Moon. Though Jack's subsequent fate is unknown, he was later seen sensing the arrival of the mystic assassin Hellphyr.",

      "biography": "Iron Man fans pick up , onsale 4/21, with bios of all your favorite Shellhead-related character.Electrical engineer Anton Vanko lived with his family in Volstok, Russia, home of a resistance movement seeking to secede from the Russian Federation. High-ranking officials within the Russian government contracted with the secretive international consortium known as the Iron Axis to covertly kill the separatists. Using biological material obtained from Anthony Stark without his knowledge, the Iron Axis had earlier created a series of imperfect Stark clones which they used to infiltrate Stark Industries’ corporate headquarters on Long Island, New York. Breaching Stark’s private laboratory over a span of years, the clones stole Iron Man armor technology and then hacked into Stark’s inventory database to cover their thefts. Iron Axis sent one of its Stark clones, outfitted in Iron Man Mark 16 body armor, to attack Volstok. The clone destroyed the village and massacred more than 3000 of its inhabitants, including Vanko’s father, separatist leader Igor Vanko. Enraged, Vanko shot the attacking clone out of the sky with a makeshift pulse rifle, causing the chest plate of the Iron Man armor to fall to the ground nearby. Vanko reached for the chest plate, but severely burned four of his fingers on an exposed, energized wire. Iron Axis clandestinely retrieved the clone’s body. However, a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) satellite surveying the region at the time captured grainy images of someone attacking Volstok equipped with Iron Man body armor and a Russian tracking station scanned the clone as it crossed their border—picking up a faint bio-signature that matched Stark’s breathing, heart rate and electroencephalography. As a result, Stark was placed on trial for crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, Netherlands. Meanwhile, Vanko remained isolated in the abandoned ruins of Volstok, where he retro-engineered the Iron Man Mark 16 body armor obtained during the attack to construct his own armaments. As Whiplash, he traveled to the ICC Detention Center, where he planned to kill the imprisoned Stark with the very weapons that were used to kill his friends and family. However, Stark escaped Whiplash’s assault using a suit of makeshift body armor he assembled in the detention center. When Stark tracked the Iron Axis to a Japanese island, Vanko followed him and reluctantly joined forces with Stark to defeat the Axis’ Iron Man clones. Even after Stark rebuilt Volstok, Vanko still blamed him for creating the technology that killed his father, but set his sights on exacting vengeance upon the Russian government.",

      "biography": "Proud of her family’s legacy as bearers of the Jade Amulets of Power, Ava Ayala takes up the White Tiger mantel without hesitation. Inspired by her older brother Hector who dedicated his life to helping people, she does the same and joins the respected ranks of the Mighty Avengers and Luke Cage’s Heroes for Hire.\n\n \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAVA AYALA\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAva Ayala is the baby of her family. While her siblings are much older than her, with kids even, she thought it nice that everyone fusses over her but it was a lonely childhood spent mostly idolizing her oldest brother, Hector. Hector fights crime as White Tiger, enhanced by the Jade Amulets of Power, talismans of the Tiger God (possibly Bai Hu of the Xian pantheon). Tragically, one afternoon, she arrives home from school to witness anti-hero militant Gideon Mace’s hirelings killing her parents and sister Awilda, and they gravely injured her as well. Barely surviving a similar attack, Hector gives up the White Tiger identity and leaves Manhattan, Ava remaining in the guardianship of Awilda’s husband.\n\nYears later, following Hector’s death, Awilda’s daughter Angela inherits the amulets and White Tiger identity; however, after Hand ninjas mystically corrupt her, Ava, now a teenager, acquires the amulets. Ava then joins the Avengers Academy in California.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nANCIENT MYSTICAL AMULETS\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhite Tiger’s amulets grant her enhanced strength (Class 10), speed, stamina, coordination, agility, durability, endurance, and mastery of martial arts. Under extreme conditions, she can project the amulets’ energies as concussive force. When separated from the amulets, she can sense their proximity; prolonged separation induces painful symptoms similar to drug withdrawal.\n\nThe amulets have provided prior users with enhanced healing capabilities, the ability to camouflage against various surfaces and the power and the ability to transform into a costumed form and back again, but Ava has yet to demonstrate these traits. She carries an Avengers signal device for ready contact.\n\nGrowing up with her family who hails from Puerto Rico, Ava is fluent in both Spanish and English.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDANGEROUS DEITIES AND FOES\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe White Tiger God contained in the Jade amulets grants the wearer superhuman powers and mastery over martial arts, but it is a controlling god and Ava as its avatar makes a deal with the God that allows him to control her for one night per week without interference from her. But the possession gets out of hand and Ava ultimately overcomes and controls the god with sheer will and a persuasive argument.\n\nDeranged ex-Army colonel Gideon Mace’s men brutally murdered Ava’s parents and her sister Awilda in front of her, and though she suffers a bullet wound to the lung, Ava survives. She later takes up the White Tiger mantel and hears that Mace is let out and she tries to kill him but the Mighty Avengers intervene and prevent her from doing so.\n\nAva goes up against her fellow Avengers Academy student Reptil when he allies with Jimmy Marks, AKA Hybrid, who attempts to feed on the power of Ava’s amulets. It’s not until she tries to sacrifice herself that Reptil changes his tune and the villain is defeated.\n\nWhen the sociopath Jeremy Briggs’ tries to depower superhumans with help from the mystic Coat of Arms, Coat uses Ava and Reptil’s amulets against them. Though Ava makes a deal with the Tiger God and eventually the villains are defeated.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFAMILY TIES AND VIGILANTE ALLIES\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAva grows up with her parents Nestor and Maria, her older brothers Hector and Filippo and sister Awilda Ayala-Del Toro. By marriage, she is related to Soledad Ayala, Hector’s wife, and Mr. Del Toro, Awilda’s husband. Her nieces and nephews include Marisol, Rey and Angela Del Toro. She grows up idolizing her brother Hector who is the first White Tiger in their family and inherits the White Tiger mantel from her niece Angela after she becomes corrupted by the Hand.\n\nFollowing in her brother’s heroic footsteps, Ava works with the amulet’s Tiger God and joins the Avengers Academy. There, she allies with other superpowered students and learns skills necessary to defeat villains and protect others under Henry Pym, AKA Giant-Man’s direction. She ends up joining the Mighty Avengers and Luke Cage’s Heroes for Hire where she becomes a hired mercenary for a time.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTHE WHITE TIGER'S TALE\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen Henry Pym, AKA Giant-Man, opened Avengers Academy to the public, she joined the student body as the newest White Tiger, concealing occasional blackouts, periods of possession by the Tiger God. She clashed with another student empowered by a mystic amulet, fellow Hispanic hero Reptil, whom she felt had neglected responsibilities to the Hispanic community and who, in turn, supposedly resented her for claiming her brother’s costumed identity; unknown to classmates and instructors, Reptil’s consciousness had been supplanted by his future self from Earth-11511. To further his history-altering goals, Reptil allied with half-Dire Wraith Jimmy Marks, AKA Hybrid, who overpowered several students and attempted to feed on the power of Ava’s amulets; his actions prompted the Tiger God to surface and nearly kill Reptil before Ava re-asserted control.\n\nNot yet understanding the full nature of her power, Ava erroneously believed the Tiger God to be a monstrous manifestation of her psyche and asked Reptil to kill her rather than risk it surfacing again. Her courage prompted Reptil to turn against Hybrid, who shut down the pair’s higher brain functions. He sent them into battle against the Avengers, but Reptil retained enough control to push Ava against Hybrid, and contact with her amulets disrupted Hybrid’s power, enabling Giant-Man to dispatch Hybrid to a limbo dimension, while contemporary Reptil regained control of his body.\n\nBriefly attracted to fellow student Juston Seyfert, Ava subsequently pursued a romantic relationship with Reptil. When the Academy students opposed sociopath Jeremy Briggs’ attempt to depower the world’s superhumans, his mystic operative Coat of Arms used the power of Ava and Reptil’s amulets against them. When the two struggled against Coat for control, Ava had a mystic encounter with the Tiger God, who preferred Coat as an avatar but agreed to re-empower Ava if she allowed it a day of full control per month. Following Briggs’ defeat, Giant-Man awarded the students Avengers Third Grade rank.\n\nWhen wealthy assassin Arcade’s machinations apparently killed Reptil, Seyfert and other teenage heroes, Ava grew obsessed with living up to self-imposed heroic standards; after assisting the Young Avengers and others against extradimensional parasite Mother, she briefly served with Luke Cage’s Heroes for Hire but grew dissatisfied with mercenary work and resigned. After working with Cage and others to banish ancient demon Shuma-Gorath, however, she joined Cage’s reorganized Mighty Avengers team. Upon learning Gideon Mace had resumed militia activity, Ava allowed the Tiger God full control of her body to hunt him down&nbsp;but, ultimately refusing to kill Mace, she mentally influenced the Tiger God into being defeated by Cage’s team.\n\nBriefly imprisoned, Ava mystically dominated the Tiger God and regained control. Following the team’s physical merge into Avenger Prime to defeat the Deathwalker Prime, Ava began dating teammate Victor Alvarez, AKA Power Man. The Mighty Avengers disbanded&nbsp;and while White Tiger and Power Man joined the New Avengers led by Sunspot, they ceased their romantic relationship.\n\nWhen Ava came up against her niece Angela, who had received amulets from an alternate universe and was still under the control of the Hand, Ava’s White Tiger avatar realized he didn’t need Ava anymore and left her. She lost her powers but kept up the guise and pushed herself to her limits. When the Avengers base was attacked by New Revengers including Angela, Ava faced her again and snatched the amulet back. In breaking it, she freed Angela from the Hand’s hold and the White Tiger as well. Both Ava and her Angela fought the New Revengers&nbsp;and worked together on other missions. Ava then retired and convinced her niece to do so as well.\n\nThough Ava later answered a distress call from the Defenders when they were up against Diamondback. As White Tiger, she fought alongside Elektra, Spider-Woman, Echo, Colleen Wing and Misty Knight.",

      "biography": "When Kyle Gibney's mutant powers began to emerge at an early age, he was left with a freakish appearance. Horrified, his parents kicked him out of his home, and he was left wandering the streets. Eventually found by the subversive organization, the Secret Empire, Gibney was experimented upon in their attempts to create a perfect killing machine. As a part of the experiment, Gibney was injected with DNA from the assassin Wyre, which left Gibney near-mindless, animalistic, and uncontrollable. Wyre later rebelled and destroyed the Secret Empire's headquarters, and Gibney was found by agents of the Canadian government and given over to Department H, then headed by James Hudson as a sanctioned program for developing Canada's superhero teams. Hudson placed Gibney in the entry-level Gamma Flight with the code-name Wild Child. (Like all recruits, those who developed their powers sufficiently would be placed in the premiere team, Alpha Flight.) During his training, Wild Child was mentored by Wolverine until he left to join the X-Men. Unfortunately, the government disbanded the Department H program and, by extension, its hero teams. Gibney's subsequent activities remain unrevealed until Delphine Courtney and Jerry Jaxon recruited him for Omega Flight. Jaxon hoped to destroy Hudson and his Alpha Flight, which had reassembled as a private team, but Omega Flight was captured by Alpha Flight and its members imprisoned. Gibney managed to break out only once, and in his rampage, began killing indiscriminately. Nearly killing Heather Hudson, it took Wolverine to hunt him down and capture him again.During a period of time in which Alpha Flight was believed dead, the Canadian government decided to reinstate a fully-sanctioned hero team under the name Gamma Flight. Gibney was recruited for the team and pardoned for his previous activities. When Alpha Flight reappeared, the two teams clashed, and Alpha Flight was forced to go on trial. Ultimately, Alpha Flight rejected the government's support and decided to operate independently once more. Gamma Flight continued as the government-sponsored team, and the two teams eventually met again to fight the evil Llan the Sorcerer. Gamma Flight was nearly destroyed in the final battle, but Llan was defeated. Afterward, the two teams combined into one, with Alpha Flight again reinstated as Canada's official superhero group. Kyle soon found himself slipping into his bestial nature more and more often. One time in particular, he savagely went on another rampage, in the process attacking his teammate Pathway. Gamma Flight's former leader, Nemesis, teleported Kyle away to an unknown location, professing to have a solution. He reappeared months later as Weapon Omega, mysteriously cured of his animalistic rages and possessing a handsome appearance. He helped Alpha Flight on numerous occasions, soon joining their team once more. To further disassociate from his past, Kyle took a new code-name, Wildheart. During this time, Gibney and his teammate Aurora fell in love and began a relationship. However, Kyle eventually began to mutate back to his ugly appearance. Since he could not stand to be seen that way by his lover, he left, unaware that his sudden departure would cause Aurora's fragile psyche to deteriorate even further.Kyle Gibney, now calling himself Wild Child once more, accepted an offer to join the United States' sanctioned mutant team, X-Factor. This caused a bit of friction between Gibney and X-Factor's associate, Sabretooth, who was impressed into service. Eventually, however, Gibney's body began mutating even further, and he quit the team to explore his new mutations and to find his true self.Somehow, Kyle ended up in custody of the new Weapon X program, under the auspices of the mysterious Director, who hoped to use the program's mutants for the benefit of humankind, even if that meant performing deadly missions and interning mutant captives. The program’s scientist experimented on Kyle, who became more intelligent but more feral-looking, and was once again dubbed Wild Child. The Director found that Gibney had been twisted so many times that he no longer held an identity of his own, needing only minimal suggestions via conventional methods to follow orders like a machine or an animal.One of Gibney's initial assignments was to recruit mutants for the Weapon X program. On one particular mission, to recruit Sunfire, Kyle's teammate Sabretooth became annoyed with him, lashing out and severing Gibney's vocal cords, rendering him mute. Another assignment was to recruit Kyle's one-time lover, Aurora. (In fact, this assignment was one of the reasons the Director of the program wanted Kyle in the first place.) Wild Child successfully freed Aurora from the mental asylum she was assigned, but, unfortunately, after Aurora was believed cured of her mental condition, she rejected Gibney due to his new freakish appearance.Wild Child continued to serve in Weapon X, even to the point of capturing innocent mutants to be interned at the camp Neverland. In watching Aurora, who was becoming increasingly romantic with the Director, Malcolm Colcord, Gibney was persuaded to join agent Brent Jackson who was hoping to form a group to stage a coup with the Director. Gibney agreed, and Jackson's allies joined the team Underground, led by Cable who hoped to take down the Weapon X program. The Underground was able to infiltrate the Weapon X complex, ousting the Director and nearly crippling the program. However, before the final defeat, agent Jackson betrayed the Underground, turning Cable's psychic powers against his allies. Jackson captured the Underground members and altered their memories to erase everything they saw and learned about the program. Jackson took credit for saving the program and was named the new Director of the Weapon X program.Gibney continued to serve the Weapon X program under Jackson, being named the Head of Security. However, when investigating Weapon X,  Wolverine found the program disappeared, its compound suddenly vacant. Wild Child’s whereabouts and subsequent activities remain unrevealed. After reality was House of M|twisted by the Scarlet Witch, many of Earth’s mutants were stripped of their powers. Wild Child was revealed to have been among these, as his mutant energy signature was recognized as having been absorbed by the Collective.However, Wild Child has recently reappeared, faster and stronger than ever before, working for the mysterious Romulus. His one goal seems to be the destruction of Wolverine.",

His newborn son was born a mutant. Stryker went insane, killing mother and child. He then ignited their car in the attempt to commit suicide. The incident and his behavior afterwards soon caused Stryker to be discharged from the military.Stryker learned from articles by Charles Xavier that his son was a mutant. He became convinced that Satan had a plot to corrupt humankind by taking over their souls while still in the womb, resulting in their mutations. He began to think of himself as 'chosen by God' to destroy mutants and formed Strkyer's Crusade and the Purifiers.While his followers committed hate crimes against mutants, Stryker had an elaborate campaign to take out the X-Men and Stryker arranged to have Professor Xavier kidnapped, brainwashed, and attached to a machine that, using his brainpower, would kill all living mutants. Magneto became involved after investigating the deaths of a mutant family. In order to stop this scheme, the X-Men are forced to join forces with their nemesis, Magneto. The X-Men succeeded in stopping Stryker. He was shot by one of his own security guards and arrested.Stryker survived and was put in prison. The Purifiers reorganized in the Colorado Rockies. Using another mutant, they were able to free Stryker and lure the X-Men again. However, they clashed with the mutants of Mount Haven and an artificial intelligence calling itself Reverend Paul. Stryker ended up merging with Paul.Stryker recently emerged after House of M|M-Day, claiming it was a sign that mutants should be destroyed. His Purifiers killed a number of X-Men students, most of them depowered. Stryker revealed that his plans had given him insight into the Nimrod Sentinels creation. Stryker was killed by an enraged Elixir, and later resurrected by a techno-organic virus, but recently was killed again by Archangel, during the fight with the Purifiers.",

      "biography": "Bentley Wittman grew up possessing near-superhuman levels of genius and, as an adult, became an inventor of great renown, selling his futuristic inventions to the wealthy and becoming quite rich. He became known as the Wizard by legally assuming this stage name and using his advanced scientific inventions to perform feats of \"magic.\"Intellectually bored, however, he decided to defeat Johnny Storm, who had just appeared to the world as the Human Torch. Pretending to be a victim, he was rescued by the Torch and invited him to his high-tech, futuristic mansion on Long Island where he captured the Torch with ease. The Wizard then impersonated the Torch, launching a crime spree to destroy the Torch’s reputation, before being captured by the Fantastic Four and sent to prison.The Wizard clashed many more times with the Human Torch until the conclusion of one encounter sent him flying uncontrollably upward by one of his anti-gravity discs, unable to descend safely. He was rescued by two other adversaries of the Torch: the Sandman and Paste-Pot Pete (soon after, the Trapster). After he suggested they team up, a suggestion by the Trapster inspired him to form a team that would be a criminal counterpart to the Fantastic Four, with himself, his two rescuers, and Medusa, who was then suffering from amnesia; becoming the Frightful Four. The Frightful Four proved to be one of the most formidable menaces that the Fantastic Four had yet encountered. The Frightful Four raided the Fantastic Four's Baxter Building headquarters, and affixed the Wizard's anti-gravity discs to the four-minus Johnny-but with Alicia Masters, who managed to alert the Torch with the Invisible Girl's flare gun. Johnny soon appeared and forced the Wizard to use his anti-grav ship to free his team members before they floated into airless space. Then, together they beat the Frightful Four until the Wizard and the Sandman exploded the Wizard's ship as a distraction, and escaped. Later, kidnapping the Invisible Girl, they lured the Fantastic Four to a Pacific atoll where they rigged an experimental \"Q-bomb\" to detonate. The Fantastic Four narrowly escaped. Weeks later, the Frightful Four made their third attempt. Capturing the Thing, the Wizard used his \"Id Machine\" to simulate the Thing's natural tendencies toward violence and brainwash him into obeying the Wizard's commands. The Fantastic Four finally managed to subdue the Frightful Four, then all but Medusa were turned over to the authorities. The Wizard later broke out from prison, after helping the Sandman escape, and fought the Fantastic Four on his own. He created a set of wonder gloves to enchance his powers, but the four (minus Susan) beat him and took his gloves. Next, he created more powerful ones that would mimic the powers of the four, however he was unprepared to face the elemental powers of their newest member-Susan's replacement and the sister of Medusa-the Inhuman Crystal. Using her powers, she managed to counteract his and send him fleeing away.In his continued quest to crush the Fantastic Four, the Wizard has tried many iterations of the Frightful Four. He twice brought Medusa back into the ranks, but, as she was no longer a criminal, having since regaining her memories, she betrayed them both times. He also never succeeded in finding a permanent replacement for her. His first choice, Thundra, also ended up allying herself with the Fantastic Four as Medusa did. Others who joined the team for a time included Electro, Llyra, and the Brute (Reed Richards of the original Counter-Earth). When the Sandman appeared to give up his life of crime, the Wizard formed a new team with Hydro-Man, Klaw, and Titania. But however formidable, the Frightful Four have always been thwarted by their heroic counterparts.Very rarely has the Wizard operated outside of the Frightful Four. Once, he formed a partnership with Mysterio, but was foiled by Spider-Man. Another time, he teamed up with the Plantman to escape prison and ran into a conflict with the Avengers. He was later broken out of prison by Loki to join the an assemblage of villains organizing acts of vengeance against the Avengers, but he was sorely defeated. Often avoiding the limelight that he once embraced, the Wizard hoped to hide from authorities using his former name Bentley Wittman. He was found by the Thunderbolts, however, who convinced the Wizard to provide anti-gravity discs in order for them to battle Graviton. Later still, when the Sandman had appeared to reform his criminal ways, the Wizard took it upon himself to subject his former ally to his id machine, re-integrating the Sandman’s mind and restoring him to villainy.Finally, when the Fantastic Four’s popularity reached an all-time low, the Wizard decided it was time to re-form the Frightful Four once more. No longer motivated by petty jealousy, the Wizard believed the Fantastic Four to be the source of all his troubles, his fall from grace. He rescued the Trapster from the Negative Zone, boosted the powers of Hydro-Man, and called upon his ex-wife, Salamandra, to round out the Frightful Four. He also manipulated Cole, his and Salamandra’s daughter, to develop a relationship with the Human Torch in order to teleport to her and bypass the Fantastic Four’s defenses. During the resulting battle, the Wizard turned on the Trapster, revealing that he intended Cole to be the next member of the Frightful Four.  When the Frightful Four defeated the heroes, the Wizard flaunted his success on television and left them humiliated. However, when the Wizard admitted that he only wanted to include Cole once he saw her exhibit superhuman powers, she turned on him. She sought out the Fantastic Four to lead them back to her father and to try to find a cure for her powers. The Wizard and Cole confronted each other, and Cole used one of the Trapster’s traps to ensnare her father, then used her powers over gravity to bring the Wizard’s lair down around him.",

      "biography": "James Howlett is a mutant who has been alive for over a century. Over the years, James's mind has undergone numerous traumas, including scientific tampering by clandestine organizations, which have made it impossible for him to remember his true past. What he is left with is bits and pieces of memory and no way to tell when, and if, many of the events actually took place. What is clear is that, prior to the Mutant-Human War, James, codenamed Wolverine, was a key operative in the S.H.I.E.L.D. organization. Trained by some of the best military men on the planet, including Nick Fury and Frank Castle, Wolverine was used in only the most covert of operations. Because his superiors knew of his Mutant nature, he was kept away from the Mutant-Human War. It was only when the war was all but lost that his superiors decided to brainwash Wolverine into carrying out an assassination attempt on the mutants' leader, Magneto. The mission never took place. With mutants victorious, S.H.I.E.L.D. was temporarily shut down. James was released from his solitary quarters and discovered a brave new mutant world.As S.H.I.E.L.D. was restructured by its new Director, Sebastian Shaw, Wolverine was placed in charge of a special squad of mutants known as the Red Guard. It was here he met his current lover, Mystique. The Red Guard has been used almost exclusively to hunt down human terrorists and superhuman threats. It has been more than up to the task with a 100 percent success rate. With family and friends, and a new place in the world, James was finally content.Unfortunately, things have changed. James has begun to have nightmares causing him to question his own life and the world itself. He has attempted to drown these with alcohol and painkillers but this has proved unsuccessful. Though he hates the idea of anyone \"mucking\" around in his head, he even turned to the S.H.I.E.L.D. telepaths for help, but they failed.These images have become more visceral and have led Wolverine to make some questionable decisions in the field. Those decisions have led Sebastian Shaw and his team, including Mystique, to question Wolverine's sanity and future role in S.H.I.E.L.D.",

      "biography": "A Long History\n\nJames Howlett was born to wealthy John and Elizabeth Howlett in Alberta, Canada, during the last years of the 19th century. As a child, he was frail and unhealthy due to his overactive mutant immune system and was neglected by his mother, who had been institutionalized following the death of her first son, John Jr., in 1897. James’s mutant abilities were triggered when his father was shot by the Howlett groundskeeper Thomas Logan, whom he did not know was his real father. James killed Logan, slashed the face of Logan’s son and his friend Dog, and left Alberta with a childhood friend, Rose O’Hara.\n\nHis healing abilities drove trauma from his memories, leaving him partially amnesiac. He and Rose found refuge at a British Columbia stone quarry, where Rose, claiming James was her cousin, gave his name as “Logan.” Within months, Logan’s powers were heightening due to the environment around him. He became healthier and gained senses to rival those of an animal, but also became more violent. To divert some of this pent-up rage, Logan partook in cage fights where his prowess earned him the nickname “Wolverine.” After accidentally killing Rose with his claws, Logan retreated into the woods where he lived as a feral beast, losing all of his former memories.\n\nHe would later reenter society and travel the world, partaking in every major conflict of the 20th century (WWI, WWII, the Spanish Civil War, the Vietnam War) as a soldier, criminal, or mercenary for hire. This caused him to coin the phrase \"I'm the best there is at what I do, but what I do best isn't very nice.”\n\nWhile on the run from the law, he was abducted by the Canadian super soldier program known as “Weapon X.” He had previously been a willing participant in the program in the early 1960s as an international operative of Team X. Logan was a prime candidate for this new iteration of Weapon X due to his incredibly fast healing and endurance, which allowed Doctor Cornelius and his team to fuse adamantium to his skeleton. The experiment was successful and gave Logan more control over his berserker nature, but also wiped him of any residual memories he had lingering in his head.\n\nWhen the Hulk blundered his way into Canadian territory, Logan was mobilized against the green gargantuan. He was also used to kill the entire population of a small town in a field test, but eventually broke loose from his captors, slaying almost everyone at the Weapon X facility. Despite this, they still had his DNA and were able to create new mutants like Avery Connor and clawed clone called X-23 (aka Laura Kinney).\n\nHis real sense of belonging would not arrive until he joined the X-Men.\n\nSlashing Skills\n\nWolverine’s rapid regeneration powers allow him to bounce back from almost every type of bodily wound on the condition that his head remains firmly attached to his shoulders. Nevertheless, the time of each healing is understandably proportionate to the severity of the injury. His body is also immune to most poisons, drugs, and diseases; his agility, reflexes, and senses are similarly enhanced. Wolverine sees and hears things at distances far greater than those of ordinary humans. His sense of smell is even more magnified and he can recognize people and objects by scent alone, which, combined with combat and stealth training, makes him one of the world’s foremost trackers.\n\nThe most iconic of his natural weapons are six retractable, slightly curved, foot-long bone claws, three in each arm, beneath the skin and muscle of his forearms. He can, at will, release these claws through the skin beneath his knuckles. The claws are naturally sharp and tougher than normal human bone, allowing them to penetrate most types of flesh and natural materials.\n\nHe has an extra defense from the Weapon X program, where his skeleton was coated in the near-indestructible steel alloy known as adamantium. This adds an extra 105 pounds to his frame—or 47.6 kilograms in Mr. Howlett’s native metric system. Immediately after this procedure, his healing factor was slowed so that it might take weeks to recover from multiple wounds, but eventually the factor returned to full strength and speed. The adamantium renders his bones virtually unbreakable and his claws capable of penetrating almost any substance depending on its thickness and the force he exerts. His reinforced skeleton also enables him to withstand heavy physical pressure, giving his muscles sufficient force to briefly lift 800 pounds or more.\n\nTo top things off, Wolverine is trained in hand-to-hand combat, computer systems, vehicles, weapons, and is fluent in Cheyenne, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Lakota, Russian and Spanish, with some French, Thai, and Vietnamese.\n\nThe Snikt List\n\nWolverine’s enemies are numerous and it is often hard not to blame them. After all, he is a hard guy to get along with.\n\nHowever, an adversary, with abilities to match Logan’s, is Victor Creed (AKA Sabertooth) who also has retractable claws and healing factor. The two first clashed in Japan with Logan coming out on top and leaving Creed for dead, unaware that he had regenerative powers as well. Creed is an operative of the mastermind Romulus, ruler of the wolf-like Lupine and a worldwide criminal empire. Two of Wolverine’s maternal uncles, Elias and Frederick Hudson, work for him, although he is unaware of it. Romulus kept an eye on Logan for a good portion of his life and mentally manipulated him at times.\n\nLogan’s Heroes\n\nWhile a brief member of the Canadian Super Hero team known as Alpha Flight, Wolverine joins the X-Men at the behest of Professor Charles Xavier. This is his most iconic home and the place where he enters into an on-again, off-again relationship with telepath Jean Grey.

      "biography": "Howlett's past is mostly unknown, but during World War II he participated in military airdrops with Captain America. Decades later, he was abducted and experimented upon by a covert government unit, who bonded unbreakable adamantium to his skeleton. Initially designated Weapon X (later the name of the entire unit), Howlett was renamed both \"Logan\" and \"Wolverine.\" Weapon X held him for at least a decade.  Supposedly programmed to kill any human he saw, he proved his humanity was intact by saving Nick Fury's life in the Middle East. He grew to hate his captors and also his fellow prisoner, Sabretooth.Fury eventually helped him escape, and Wolverine became a mercenary, frequently working for Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants. He was constantly pursued by Weapon X, on one occasion evading them with the aid of the young adventurer Spider-Man. A year and a half after his escape, Wolverine was assigned by Magneto to assassinate Charles Xavier, leader of the X-Men. Successfully infiltrating the X-Men, Wolverine delayed his mission in order to romance Marvel Girl, but in the succeeding weeks he embraced Xavier's cause and turned on Magneto, fighting the Brotherhood alongside the X-Men.\n\nSoon afterward, Weapon X captured and enslaved most of the X-Men; Wolverine escaped, informed Nick Fury of the abductions, and then allowed himself to be captured in order to lead rescuers to Weapon X's secret base. While Wolverine was drawn into a grudge match with Sabretooth, the Brotherhood of Mutants raided the base, and Fury arrived to kill Wraith and guarantee the X-Men's freedom.Wolverine remained jealous of Marvel Girl's boyfriend Cyclops, and when they investigated Magneto's abandoned Savage Land lair together, Wolverine left Cyclops to die. Wolverine helped the other X-Men battle Magneto and the Ultimates, but as the multi-front conflict reached its conclusion, Cyclops returned, exposing Wolverine's misconduct and kicking him off the team. Retreating into isolation, Wolverine was surprised when Cyclops, feeling Wolverine's rehabilitation outweighed their feud, invited him back and informed him S.H.I.E.L.D. had discovered evidence of his earlier life: a wedding ring.Troubled by the revelation, Wolverine departed again, but was targeted by Weapon X renegades whom he defeated alongside Spider-Man and Daredevil. Wolverine has gradually regained the X-Men's trust, and been startled by a growing attraction between him and Storm. Recently, Wolverine was killed by Magneto.",

      "biography": "Simon Williams inherited his father's industrial munitions plant after his father died and his older brother, Eric, did not want to take over. Although a capable scientist, Simon nevertheless was not a businessman, and the company started to fail. Eric suggested that Simon embezzle money to invest in Eric's own business, which happened to be illegal racketeering with Maggia ties. The embezzlement and racketeering was discovered, and Simon went to jail, blaming his downfall on Tony Stark (a.k.a. the hero Iron Man and member of the team Avengers.)Simon was released with help from the original Baron Zemo and his Masters of Evil. Simon agreed to undergo an experiment to give him superhuman powers, and Zemo gave him the costumed guise of Wonder Man, warning Simon that he would die without further treatments from Zemo in order to ensure his loyalty. At Zemo's behest, Simon befriended Avengers, pretending to be their ally, and lured them into a trap. However, he repented at the last minute and saved the Avengers from the Masters, seemingly at the cost of his own life. In fact, Simon had really fell into a death-like coma. Before he was buried, his brain patterns were recorded for scientific purposes (and were later used to build the android Vision.)Simon's body was about to be buried when it was captured by his brother, now known as the Grim Reaper and who had already battled the Avengers, blaming them for Simon's death. The Reaper wanted to use the body to bribe the robotic Vision to accept a human body. The Vision refused, where it was first revealed that Vision's mind was based on Simon's own brain patterns.Eric later tried to have Simon's body resurrected by the voodoo of the Black Talon, and Wonder Man was used as a zombie to attack the Avengers. Instead, Simon was restored to consciousness by the Living Laser who was holding the powerful Serpent Crown artifact. Afterwards, the Avengers accepted Wonder Man as a staunch ally and he was later elected to full-time membership. His presence was always a source of tension for the Vision, who felt insecure as Simon was the source of his “life.” At one point, Wonder Man and the Vision were placed on \"trial\" by the Grim Reaper to determine which of them was the \"real\" Simon Williams. Simon was accepted as the \"real\" brother by Eric, but Wonder Man subdued the Reaper to save the Avengers.Simon's effectiveness as a fighter was limited by a lingering fear of death and chronic self-confidence problems. Despite his fears, he helped the Avengers fight major foes such as Ultron and Count Nefaria, and he ultimately overcame his fear of death to play a key role in Avengers' struggle with the supremely powerful Korvac. Soon after this, however, Simon left the Avengers to become an actor, although he would find much more success as a Hollywood stuntman. He would occasionally return to the Avengers to help them on an as-needed basis.Simon was among the Avengers who founded their West Coast branch. Although he continued to struggle with fear of death and failure, he largely overcame fear of death with emotional support from Hank Pym and the Vision. He confessed feelings of inferiority to the Vision, who he began to regard affectionately as a twin brother of sorts. He further conquered feelings of shame and fear by publicly confessing his embezzlement of funds from Williams Innovations, an act long assumed by many to be the work of his criminal brother, Eric. Simon gained enhanced fame and growing confidence as a result of his public confession, which ultimately helped him land a starring role in a major motion picture, Arkon IV, becoming a genuine Hollywood celebrity.Simon served with the Avengers West Coast throughout its existence. During this time, he furthered his acting career and becoming romantically involved with Alex Flores, a screenwriter. He opted not to stay at the Avengers' Compound, but instead lived in a Los Angeles apartment where he befriended many of his neighbors.When the Vision had been reduced to an emotionless robot after the seeming destruction of his artificial mind, Simon refused to allow the Avengers to duplicate his brain patterns as part of their efforts to restore the android. The Scarlet Witch, the Vision's wife at the time, became bitterly estranged from Simon for his refusal, which actually stemmed from the fact that he held a long-time infatuation with her, and unconsciously wanted the Scarlet Witch for himself. He finally agreed to allow the duplication of his brain patterns after a distraught Scarlet Witch suffered a mental breakdown, but the Vision declined the offer since he had realized that duplicating Simon's brain patterns would not truly, fully restore his lost personality, but merely create a similar facsimile. Simon became very supportive and attentive to the Scarlet Witch as she recovered from her mental breakdown, and he even sought a romance, briefly dating her. However, the Witch ultimately rejected Simon, which led him to overcompensate by pursuing assorted starlets.On a later adventure, Simon joined with the Avengers to stop the alien races of Kree and Shi'ar from dragging Earth into their war. The Shi'ar developed a massive \"Nega-Bomb\" to decimate the Kree empire, and Simon and the Vision tried to stop it. Instead they were caught in the explosion. Simon found his powers mutating, eroding his mental and physical stability (for instance, he later found that his strength fluctuated with his emotional state, increasing when he became angry.) He radiated so much ionic energy that he began altering those around him. His neighbors in his apartment developed superpowers of their own, forming a short-lived team called the Crazy Eight. Ultimately, Simon's instability led him to leave the Avengers. As he struggled through, he tried to kindle his romance with Alex Flores, proposing to her.Eventually, Simon returned to rejoin the Avengers' West Coast branch, only to find it had disbanded in his absence. Simon was contacted by Iron Man to join his new team, Force Works. During Force Work's fist mission, however, Simon was killed when intercepting a bomb set by potential alien invaders.Simon was accidentally mystically resurrected by the Scarlet Witch, who had issued a magical summons to anyone associated with the Avengers during her capture by the sorceress Morgan Le Fay. He continued to exist as disembodied energy after his death, bound to the earthly by his long-unrequited love for the Scarlet Witch. He seemed to have sacrificed his life yet again to save the Avengers from Morgan Le Fay, but he began periodically manifesting in the vicinity of the Scarlet Witch as a sort of ghostly energy wraith, appearing when she needed help or felt lonely. Never fully resurrected, Simon was stuck \"in-between\" as it were, and was used by his brother, who was also deceased at the time, to weaken the borders between life and death and create a Hell on Earth, with resurrected versions of deceased Avengers as his lieutenants. Simon was similarly mystically enslaved by the Grim Reaper and pitted against the Avengers, but Simon turned on the Reaper after escaping his control. The Scarlet Witch was finally able to bodily resurrect Simon by realizing her love for him. Simon, in turn, was able to bodily resurrect his brother, by realizing their love for each other.Simon elected to stay at the Avengers mansion, exploring his relationship with the Scarlet Witch while serving alongside the team as a non-member. He tried to rebuild his brotherly relationship with the Vision, who remained largely aloof. Simon continued to struggle with feelings of guilt and inadequacy due to the many mistakes and misdeeds he committed during his time in California, and he briefly left the Avengers Mansion to make the rounds of his Hollywood friends and associates in an attempt to make peace with his past life and make amends for the various misdeeds he had committed. He learned his one-time fiancée, Alex Flores, had fallen in love with someone else and was happily married, and they parted on good terms. Simon was ultimately cleared of any wrongdoing regarding deaths he helped cause during his time in Los Angeles, and with his friend the Beast, he defeated and exposed crimelord Lotus after defeating her pawn, It, The Living Colossus. He finally resolved to put his troubled past behind him and established the Second Chances Foundation, a non-profit charitable enterprise devoted to helping people in need, managed by his old agent Neal Saroyan and funded by the proceeds from Simon's films, merchandise and endorsements.Simon began dividing his time between the Avengers and the Second Chances Foundation, trying to maintain a long-distance relationship with the Scarlet Witch at the same time, despite the fact that the passion had gone out of their relationship. When Kang attempted to conquer Earth, he interned many of its citizens in large camps, including a captive Scarlet Witch. Similarly captured, Simon was placed in the same internment camp. Both had realized during their time apart that they were no longer in love with each other -- the two of them having come together more from passion, loneliness and a sense of obligation than true love. The couple amicably ended their relationship and the Scarlet Witch admitted she was still in love with Vision, though she did not expect to act on it since he had finally moved on. The Scarlet Witch helped Simon escape internment and eventually Kang was defeated by the Avengers, whereupon Simon returned to California and the Second Chances Foundation.",

      "biography": "When a top-secret program attempted to recreate the original Weapon X experiment that involved the feral mutant Wolverine, they failed to secure a test subject that could survive the bonding of the virtually unbreakable metal Adamantium to their skeleton. Seeking to take the project in a new direction, the project's director, Doctor Martin Sutter, recruited renowned mutant geneticist Doctor Sarah Kinney and tasked her with creating a clone. Using the only available genetic sample from Weapon X, which was damaged, they were unable to salvage the Y chromosome after 22 attempts. Kinney then proposed they create a female clone, and though her request was initially denied, she still went ahead and produced a viable female subject, prompting Sutter to reconsider. Despite resistance from his protégé Doctor Zander Rice, whom he had raised after Rice's father was killed by a bestial Wolverine at the original Weapon X Project, Sutter allowed Kinney to proceed. As revenge for her insubordination, Rice forced Kinney to act as the surrogate mother for the clone, and she gave birth to \"X-23.\"\n\nRaised in captivity, X-23 was trained to be a weapon. Kinney did her best to ensure the child retained some semblance of humanity, but her efforts appeared to be in vain. After seven years, Rice had X-23 subjected to radiation poisoning in order to accelerate the activation of her mutant gene, then forcibly extracted her claws and coated them with Adamantium. Next, Rice created a chemical compound he called \"trigger scent\" that sent X-23 into an involuntary berserker rage upon smelling its presence. Three years later, X-23 was sent on her first field mission to kill Presidential candidate Greg Johnson. Numerous other missions followed, as X-23's services were sold to the highest bidder, and she was left emotionally stunted as a result. Rice, in an attempt to avenge his father's murder, abandoned X-23 on a particularly dangerous mission, but she survived against overwhelming odds and managed to return to the facility.\n\nUltimately, Rice persuaded Sutter to hand over control of the program to him, then secretly ordered X-23 to kill Sutter and his family. Later, Rice revealed to Kinney a chamber with dozens of incubation pods containing female clones before he fired her. Before fleeing the facility with X-23, Kinney gave her one last mission - destroy the pods and kill Rice. However, Rice was able to exact revenge on Kinney from beyond the grave, as he had earlier exposed her to the trigger scent, sending X-23 into a rage that caused her to kill her mother. As she lay dying, Kinney named X-23 Laura.\n\nX-23 surfaced in New York two years later and was found living on the streets by a pimp named Zebra Daddy, who took her in and employed her as a prostitute. During her time as a prostitute, X-23 seemed to suffer from a self-mutilating disorder. She superficially cut herself with her own claws whenever she was in a threatening situation. She also seemed to suffer some personality issues which left her mostly mute and unable to free herself from the grip of Zebra Daddy. X-23 started to come to her senses after she met Kiden Nixon, a young mutant with the ability to freeze time when in danger, and together with Kiden's teacher, they rescued another young mutant, the feral Catiana, from an angry mob. Zebra Daddy tracked X-23 down, but with the aid of her newfound friends and the mutant named Felon, Zebra Daddy's thugs were defeated. X-23 then killed him to save the lives of her friends. X-23 later took a job at the mutant-themed Wannabee's nightclub in the Mutant Town district of New York. It was there that she saved the life of the daughter of mob boss Don Parisi from a gang of thugs, whom she killed. The deaths inadvertently implicated Wolverine, prompting his teammates in the X-Men to investigate. X-23 instinctually attacked Wolverine on sight, but he was eventually able to calm her down, and she led the X-Men to Parisi's daughter. After aiding the X-Men against Parisi's super-strong mutant enforcer Geech, X-23 fled the scene. She later returned to help the X-Men save victims of a car accident, after which she was enrolled at the X-Men's Xavier Institute.\n\nX-23 quickly became very protective of Wolverine, attacking his teammate Bishop after he felled Wolverine during a training session. She also took to observing Wolverine on the mansion's security monitors. During one such viewing, an anomalous energy spike prompted X-23 to investigate. Encountering Spider-Man at the source of the signal, X-23 initially mistook him for an enemy and attacked. The pair ultimately teamed up to save the young mutant Paul Patterson from an alternate reality version of the armored Avenger Iron Man. The arrival of the heroic Captain America and the super-spy Black Widow helped turn the tide. X-23 then secretly followed Wolverine on his investigation of strange activity in the Canadian Rockies. Ambushed by the Hauk'ka, evolved Saurians from the Savage Land, X-23 managed to escape and alert the X-Men. Traveling to the Savage Land, X-23 and the X-Men teamed with the Land's lord Ka-Zar and his circumstantial allies, the Savage Land Mutates, to prevent the Hauk'ka from destroying human civilization by controlling the weather-manipulating X-Man Storm.\n\nSometime later, X-23 turned up in the in two other X-titles, without her friends. She was accused of the murders of four humans that were investigated by Wolverine and his fellow X-Men. (While she was responsible for the murders, she committed them because the victims were brutally attacking a young woman.) After a brief conflict with the mutant heroes, X-23 came to live with them at the Xavier Institute. She has nearly no social skills, so Wolverine is helping her adjust to her new life. She seems to be making friends with Shadowcat, Psylocke, and Rachel Summers. X-23 was approached by the cosmic Uni-Power in hopes of making specific use of her healing ability. Although she initially resisted its attempts to bond with her, and she remained reluctant even though it pleaded with her, she ultimately agreed to aid it and became Captain Universe for a brief time.\n\nAfter the effects of House of M|\"M-Day\", X-23 was one of the few students who didn't lose their powers. The depowered students and staff were sent home; however their bus was bombed by anti-mutant religious zealot Reverend William Stryker. Subsequently, Emma Frost had the surviving students engage in an all-in brawl, with those deemed to be the best performers assigned to a new team of trainee X-Men. Despite Frost's attempts to omit her, X-23 was among those students who made the grade.\n\nShortly afterwards, following Stryker's attack on the ex-mutant students, X-23 heard Dust talking to Icarus, who had fled the Mansion. Dust intended to meet Jay, but Laura told her it was a trap, and had to knock out her roommate to keep her safe. Donning Dust's burkha X-23 came to Stryker's compound and was shot. After a few minutes spent healing and playing possum, Laura returned to the Mansion to help fend off Stryker and his goons.\n\nThe team gave more respect to Laura following her part in stopping Stryker's attack, in which she single-handedly killed three Purifiers. Following that she started to bond with her friends, using her enhanced hearing to find out what happened to Icarus for them, learning that Stryker killed him.\n\nAfter Surge received a distress call from Forge, X-23 followed the team along to Dallas to rescue him from the Sentinel Nimrod. At the height of the desperate battle she managed to cut through to the interior of the machine with her claws, allowing the Sentinel to be defeated. She was wounded during the battle and was unable to heal herself. In order to save X-23, Julian supercharged his telekinetic powers with the help of Emma Frost in order to rush her back to the mansion where she was healed by Elixir. As Hellion recovered his strength, and found that his power levels were enhanced, Laura kept watch over him. Emma Frost confronted Laura, asking her to leave the school because of the trigger scent saying that she was a danger to everyone at the institute even Julian. Their conversation is cut short by Cessily (Mercury) coming to Laura's defense. Mercury persuades Laura to go for coffee and discuss Laura's crush on Julian. However, the cafe is attacked by Kimura and her minions. though Laura thought that Kimura was after her, she was really after Cessily.\n\nLaura goes back to the Xavier Institute when Hellion interrupts her as she is gearing up to attack against the facility. He informs her that he is coming with her. The two find a hide out where Laura interrogates a man at gun point. Upon securing the information she needs, X-23 shoots him in the head. Julian is shocked and tells her that killing will no longer be a part of their interrogation technique, X-23 remains silent and the two continue their search for the facility.",

      "biography": "Nate Grey hailed from the timeline in which the eternal mutant Apocalypse had conquered North America. Created by Apocalypse’s Horseman Sinister from genetic material taken from the mutant heroes Cyclops and Jean Grey of his reality, Nate ultimately learned that his purpose was to destroy Apocalypse. After the death of his surrogate father Forge, Nate traveled to Apocalypse’s Citadel and battled Holocaust, another of Apocalypse’s Horsemen. In an attempt to breach Holocaust’s armor, Nate stabbed him with a shard of the M’Krann Crystal, causing them both to be transported to the Earth-616, the mainstream reality.Nate’s subconscious need for companionship created a physical body for the Red Queen of Earth-998, posing as the dissipated essence of Madelyne Pryor, the deceased clone of Jean Grey. Nate and Madelyne became fast friends, journeying through Europe until Pryor left to join the newly reformed Hellfire Club. Nate subsequently encountered the evil Dark Beast, a fellow refugee from his own time, who informed Nate that his vast powers were burning out his young body and that he would die before he turned 21.After this revelation, Professor Charles Xavier, the telepathic founder of the X-Men, probed Nate’s mind. Sensing the evil in Xavier that would eventually become the powerful psionic entity Onslaught, Nate lashed out with his powers and pulled Xavier’s psyche from the astral plane. This incident allowed Onslaught to escape Xavier’s mind, and it captured Nate, Xavier, and Franklin Richards, the mutant son of Reed and Sue Richards of the world-famous Fantastic Four. Onslaught intended to use Nate’s power to fuel his plans to turn the human race into a collective consciousness, but was defeated by the combined might of America’s costumed champions.Eventually, Nate realized the full extent of his powers and became a modern-day mutant shaman. To save humanity from destruction by an alien Harvester, Nate sacrificed himself to merge his energies with the alien’s and, through the conduit it had forged with the world, into every being on the planet, thus rendering the world’s energy useless to the Harvester’s race.During his time spent in the mainstream reality, Nate had formed friendships with other heroes such as Spider-Man as well as opposing some of the worst villains known to man like the evil Abomination and the Purple Man. Grey also unwittingly unleashed a madman on the world called Jackknife.",

      "biography": "The Xorn brothers' mutant natures manifested as tiny stars inside their heads that flared out of control, devastating their small village in China until villagers managed to clamp metal masks around what was left of their heads. The anti-mutant Communist regime separated the brothers, keeping Shen in isolation in the village while Kuan-Yin was incarcerated in an underground prison. Kuan-Yin escaped once, but was recaptured soon after and a new prison constructed around him. Meanwhile, the Chinese government formed the Eight Immortals to keep Shen secure. Later, Kuan-Yin's warden made a deal to sell him to John Sublime, who sought to harvest Kuan-Yin's mutant mind. Rather than face such a grisly fate, Kuan-Yin attempted suicide by reversing the power of his star, creating a black hole that threatened to destroy the world. The X-Men arrived to defuse the situation by inviting Kuan-Yin to join the team. He accepted, but first sought time to meditate.Cyclops later visited Kuan-Yin to seek help against the threat of Nano-Sentinels released by the malevolent Cassandra Nova. They were captured by the alien Shi'ar's Imperial Guard, which had fallen under Nova's control, but managed to escape to the Xavier Institute where Kuan-Yin healed the X-Men, allowing them to better oppose Nova. Kuan-Yin subsequently took up a teaching position at the Institute and came to instruct the Special Class, into which he unsuccessfully attempted to recruit the powerful young mutant Carter Ghazikhanian. At some point, Kuan-Yin was coerced by an unknown party into believing he was the X-Men's nemesis Magneto, and he launched a devastating attack on Manhattan which was opposed by the X-Men. Kuan-Yin killed Jean Grey and was subsequently slain by Wolverine.\nLater, the X-Men were called to China after Shen's powers had again flared out of control. Opposed by the Eight Immortals, the Chinese Army, and Chinese national hero the Collective Man, the X-Men prevailed. After taking Shen to the Institute, he sensed that the individual responsible for his brother's corruption had been hiding amongst the X-Men for some time, and was still in their midst. Shen subsequently joined the X-Men in opposing an attack by the Brotherhood of Mutants. To stop the killing, Shen saw no alternative but to release his black hole, pulling the villains into the void. He then left the X-Men to reflect on the immensity of his actions.After the events of House_of_M|M-Day, Xorn's consciousness took control of the collected energies of the Earth's depowered mutants and attempted to bond with the Magneto, in exile in Genosha.

      "biography": "Patrick Carney was an award-winning baseball player of the 1950's who went on to earn an engineering degree. He was soon assigned to a top-secret government facility, \"Deep Freeze\", that was secretly holding the heroes Captain America and Bucky in suspended animation after they had grown incurably insane. Shocked by the secret, Carney lamented that heroes were nevertheless needed for his generation.Driving home that night, Carney encountered the time-traveler Cassandra Locke, who had collected information about a Skrull plot to subjugate Earth of her era. Locke was dying, and she passed on the information about the plot and Carney's future to him. She also left him her belt, the source of her time-traveling powers. Although he was only able to use the belt to boost his strength to superhuman levels, Carney used it to create the heroic identity of the Yankee Clipper.With the force of Locke's commission behind him, Carney went on to become America's foremost champion. During his time, Carney met and adventured alongside heroes such as Liberty Girl the Black Fox, and he later founded the First Line, a group of superhuman champions, which his younger brother joined as Kid Justice (later Mister Justice).During one adventure, Carney encountered Cassandra Locke once again, and the proximity of two time-traveling belts activated the capabilities of Carney's belt, propelling him 20 years into the future. Carney soon sought out his brother and other members of the First Line. The First Line member Pixie helped Carney adjust to his new time with the help of her family, the Eternals. A year later Pat deliberately time jumped again, reappearing shortly after the Fantastic Four debuted. Learning from Pixie that the First Line had died stopping a Skrull armada invading Earth, Pat decided the Yankee Clipper's time had passed, and quietly entered retirment.",

      "biography": "Ymir was formed at the beginning of creation in a place called Niffleheim.  He is an ancient being of limited intelligence. The oldest and most powerful of the Frost Giants, he tends to focus all of his energies towards destruction and little else. This may in fact be Ymir's only weakness, and the reason why Odin and his two brothers, Ville and Ve, were able to first defeat him.Except for Surtur, Ymir is the oldest known being in the \"Nine Worlds\" of the Asgardian realm.  The Frost Giants origin is lost in antiquity; however, they are known to predate the gods of Asgard themselves.  Few in number due to the heavy losses sustained over the millennia in battle with the gods, the Frost Giants dwell in the frozen land of Niffleheim north of the country of Asgard proper.  Their huge size, durability, and raw power make them the gods most formidable foes.  Age has not diminished Ymir's power in the least.  Although possessing some intelligence and capable of speech, Ymir is not particularly cunning or subtly motivated.  His vast physical power has enabled him to survive and maintain his rule over his kinsmen over the millennia. Ymir had once been imprisoned by Odin at the beginning of the age within a volcano.  It is not known how long he remained there.  He was once magically conjured to appear on Earth by the human cult of demon-worshipers called the Sons of Satannish, along with Surtur, via the spell of Fire and Ice.  They planned to use Surtur to heat up the arctic climate and Ymir to cool off the African plains.  They were dispatched from Earth when Doctor Strange used the Crystal of Conquest, which contained part of the mystical power of the demon known as Satannish and Mephisto, to transport them magically into each other's presence at the very instant they were lashing out with their weapons. They struck each others weapons canceling out each others powers and in turn were returned to their home dimension.",

      "biography": "From Centauri IV to the Stars\n\nWhen Astro came across Yondu while studying Centauri IV’s fauna and geography, he was in the middle of Hakta, a rite of passage for Zatoan males approaching manhood. Angered that this human was intruding on his sacred retreat, Yondu attacked, but was repelled by Astro’s latent mutant abilities that manifested in the form of a psychokinetic force blast. After the astronaut conveyed his peaceful intentions, the two began an unlikely friendship based on mutual respect with Yondu becoming Vance’s guide for the rest of his planetary survey.\n\nTragedy struck when the Brotherhood of the Badoon nearly wiped out or enslaved all of Earth along with its colony planets of Centauri IV, Mercury, Jupiter, and Pluto, all of which were a part of the United Federation of Earth. Yondu and Vance attempted to escape Centauri IV but were captured by Badoon forces. Astro was promised that his life would be spared if he would just prove his loyalty and kill Yondu. The astronaut pretended to agree but with one whistle from Yondu, the Zatoan’s sound-sensitive Yaka arrow sent the Badoon troops into a panicked frenzy, allowing the two friends to escape. They soon joined forces with a large-framed militiaman known as Charlie-27 and crystalline scientist Martinex T’Naga. Both were the last survivors of Jupiter and Pluto. They all reached safety thanks to the unseen help of Starhawk (Stakar Ogord), whose intent was to bring all these heroes together from the start. These were the first Guardians of the Galaxy, with Yondu, Charlie-27, Martinex, and Ogord among their initial ranks.\n\nWarrior by Nature\n\nYondu is best known for his Yaka arrows that answer to his whistling call to action, but he is also incredibly strong; as a Centaurian of above-average physical prowess, he is able to lift nearly 900 pounds. He also possesses incredible stamina, speed, durability, agility, reflexes, and acute senses of smell and hearing that surpass those of humans. Trained in the mystic ways of the Zatoan people, Yondu is blessed with a sixth sense that puts him in tune with nature and allows him to form a limited empathic link with living beings, animals and plants yielding stronger bonds. By using this power, Yondu can calm a person down via a hypnotic trance or sense their unspoken intentions. By placing himself in a trancelike state, he can replenish his inner strength and even manipulate the weather. While in this trance, he can communicate with his god Anthos or bring about visions in flame, which he then interprets for others.\n\nIn terms of physical weapons, Yondu prefers his aforementioned arrows (carrying around 20 at a time) as well as axes, bolos, daggers, flails, hatchets, maces, morning stars, scythes, spears, and swords due to his mistrust of modern technology. Nevertheless, he came to use it more while part of the Guardians, particularly starship operations, simple diagnostic devices, two-way communicators, and homing devices. The arrows are made of Yaka (or trillite) metal that is extremely receptive to sound and only found on Centauri IV. Since the substance is extremely rare, Yondu makes a habit of retrieving the 15-inch arrows from his fallen victims. He is noted as once saying, “More than once I have felled a foe not by my aim…but by my whistle.”\n\nThe Centaurian language was comprised of grunts, clicks, and whistles, so speaking English was a bit of a challenge for him. It took him years of hard effort to learn English and even then, he had to rest his throat often after speaking it. Yondu’s trademark fin or crest is known as a Tahlei and is made up of compressed hair follicles. These crests serve some sort of purpose in Centaurian mating rituals.\n\nConstellation of Connections\n\nBy working with the likes of time-traveling heroes from Earth-616 like Captain America, The Thing, Sharon Carter, and the Defenders, the Guardians of the Galaxy are able to overthrow the Badoon in Earth-691. Despite his new comrades, however, Yondu seeks peace and solitude in the woodlands on Earth, but soon realizes the planet holds no future for him. Struggling with a will to live, he rejoins a newly-established Guardians of the Galaxy who fashion themselves as a band of space explorers, rather than as protectors. After returning to Centuari IV, Yondu communes with the planet in a mystic ritual, reaffirming his faith and will to live despite the annihilation of his people.\n\nMore allies to join the team are Starhawk’s wife Altea (whose body was turned into energy) and the flame-haired sharpshooter Nikki, who is also the last survivor of Mercury. They all adopt the derelict space station Drydock as their new mobile headquarters.\n\nGalactic Guerillas\n\nEarly adversaries include the cosmic anti-life entity Karanada, an aspect of the star-spanning Topographical Man; the Reavers of Arcturus; and the cyborg super-criminal Korvac. For Korvac, the Guardians receive help from none other than Thor Odinson from Earth-616. This is around the time that Yondu begins wearing special Centaurian earrings (Kospah) and garb (Habaktu), feeling that he has greatly progressed in his mystical and martial studies to levels of advancement befitting his kind.",

      "biography": "Over 21 millennia ago, the demon Zarathos preyed on mankind, a legend even amongst his own kind. Coveting the mystical Medallion of Power, he was opposed by the Blood, humanoid beings with innate magical abilities, and the Spirits of Vengeance, the only beings capable of facing Zarathos head on. They united against him, but a Blood faction dubbed the Fallen came to worship Zarathos, strengthening the demon by channeling mankind's negative energy into him, and he briefly obtained the Medallion. The Spirits of Vengeance sacrificed themselves to seal Zarathos essence alongside theirs within the Medallion, which the Blood then shattered. To prevent the pieces ever being united, they were given to two separate human families, who were watched over by the Blood Caretaker.2000 years ago, hearing the legends, the mage K'nutu led his starving tribe to find Zarathos' early remains, and against the chief's protest, summoned Zarathos' essences back to Earth. Though diminished because part of him remained trapped in the Medallion, Zarathos led the tribe to conquer their neighbors in return for worship and souls to consume, beginning with the protesting chief. The Cult of Zarathos built a city of Ten Thousand Souls, but the Hell-Lord Mephisto - angered that Zarathos was destroying souls that might otherwise be his and regarding Zarathos as a potential rival - sent a man, later known as Centurious, to confront Zarathos. When Zarathos tried to consume his soul. Centurious proved to be immune, his soul already claimed by Mephisto; momentary doubt amongst Zarathos' followers grew when Zarathos proved unable to defeat a manifestation of Mephisto, allowing Mephisto to claim Zarathos' soul. Over subsequent centuries Mephisto bound Zarathos to human servants, wielding his flames in Mephisto's cause, his memories wiped to make him compliant. Nearly 20 years ago the Zarathos spirit fragment within the shattered Medallion possessed Max Parrish, rescuing his sister Cammy from the ancient sorcerer Comte St. Germaine. Zarathos would have kept his host stolen body, but a youthful Johnny Storm separated Max from the Medallion. Mephisto apparently claimed the errant soul fragment, as Zarathos' essence was reportably absent from the Medallion's later users. Mephisto merged Zarathos with stunt rider Johnny Blaze, one of the Caretakers charges, transforming into the vigilante Ghost Rider. Blaze and Zarathos remained bonded for years, their level of control over their shared form varying; twice they were briefly separated, once by the mage Azaziah hoping to usurp Zarathos' power, and them by Mephisto as part of a wager with Asmodeus, but were rejoined both times. Shortly after Nightmare restored Zarathos' lost memories, Ghost Rider encountered Centurious again; when Centurious was sucked into his own Crystal of Souls, Zarathos willing followed seeking vengeances, breaking his bond with Blaze. Reclaiming the crystal, Mephisto wagered with the Beyonder, who freed Zarathos to break Spider-Man's spirit, but Zarathos failed and was reimprisoned. Centurious was later freed, perhaps by Mephisto unknowingly carrying Zarathos' essence within him. Eventually escaping. the initially confused Zarathos joined the demon Lilith and her Lilin in seeking the Medallion pieces, battling the mystical heroes Midnight Sons, who included, Blaze, the new Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch), and Vengeance all three were the Caretaker's charges, with the latter two wielding Medallions fragments and possessed by Spirits of Vengeance. The Sons extradimensionally banished the Lilin, but the Fallen's arrival spared Zarathos. Though Zarathos commanded his followers to convert or kill the remaining Blood, he quietly harbored doubts about repeating past glories, feeling the world offered new passions. He drained Ghost Rider's essences, but it burned him from within, and the Midnight Sons impaled him with the Blood Foundry's sword, turning him to stone again while his soul was lost between dimensions. The Sons left him in Cypress Hills Cemetery, unaware Lilith was carrying his child. Mephisto's son Blackheart later kidnapped Blaze, using him to draw Zarathos back briefly remerging them as Ghost Rider. Although that bond was seemingly broken, Blaze has since become Zarathos' host again; how this happened remains unrevealed.",

      "biography": "In the early ages of the Earth, a sentient life-force developed and one day manifested itself into the being Demiurge. He birthed the Elder Gods who eventually warred among themselves until one of them, Atum, transformed itself into Demogorge and devoured or chased away all but himself and Gaea, also known as Mother Earth. Atum would reform from the Demogorge and leave the Earth, dispersing the energies he had absorbed into the planet. When mankind eventually began rising towards sentience, their dreams gave form to the absorb energies; this transformed those who would become the progenitors of mankind's gods, notably the Olympians, regarded as deities by the peoples of Greece and the Roman Empire.Mythology holds that Gaea, the sole remaining Elder God, gave birth to Ouranos. She then mated with him, and they parented the Olympians, the Titans. They resided in an interdimensional pocket universe in the city known as Olympus, though the City's origins are unrevealed. Ouranos was eventually slain by his son, Chronus, who feared the same treatment from his own children and he began imprisoning them in a dark underworld known as Hades. Before Chronus could similarly banish his sixth child, his wife Rhea fled through a dimensional portal to Earth, arriving near Greece's Mount Olympus, where the child was raised among the shepherds. After reaching adulthood this child, Zeus, freed his siblings Demeter, Hera, Poseidon, Pluto and Vesta from Hades and led the war against their father, a war they would eventually win. Zeus imprisoned most of the surviving Titans in Hades and set himself up as ruler of Olympus, taking his sister Hera as his queen. Pluto was asked to rule over the underworld and guard its prisoners, Poseidon was given dominion over Earth's seas, Demeter was assigned to watch over the land, and Vesta was to watch over the people. Zeus ruled a peaceful Olympus for centuries while he and his siblings populated the realm through interbreeding with humans, extradimensionals, Titans, and whatever else caught their fancy. Select mortals or aliens were occasionally added to the pantheon as well, sometimes further empowered by Zeus.",

      "biography": "Though magic users on Earth have reanimated the dead using various means for thousands to millions of years, the Voodoo god Sagbata (Baron Samedi) and the Elder God Chthon combined forces in the 17th century to create a potent spell, and most subsequent practitioners have tapped into their magic to create zombies; however, the best known zombie, Simon Garth, is strangely atypical. War hero Simon Garth was senior partner for 25 years to Brian Stockwood in Garwood Industries, maker of leading Garth Manor Coffee. Divorced after assaulting his wife Miranda, Garth raised their daughter, Donna, to adulthood in New Orleans, Louisiana. The controlling Garth violently berated and fired his gardener Gyps for lusting after Donna. Gyps later ambushed Garth, taking him into the bayou where a \"red sect\" of voodoo practitioners planned a human sacrifice. The priestess of the ritual was Layla, Garth's secretary, who had fallen in love with him. Layla pretended to perform the sacrifice, but then allowed Garth to flee into the swamp, but Gyps caught up to Garth and slew him with his gardening shears. Feeling cheated by Garth's quick death, Gyps forced Layla to transform Garth into a zombie. Upon digging out of his fresh grave, Garth went on a rampage until one of the cultists placed an Amulet of Damballah around the Zombie's neck, giving its twin to Gyps, allowing him to control Garth. After failed efforts to use Garth to steal money, Gyps sent Garth to terrify Donna, intending to win her favor by pretending to rescue her. Seeing his daughter, however, Garth somehow threw off Gyps' control and slew his former master before returning to his bayou grave. The Amulet was found in Gyps' shack a few weeks later by Detective Sam Jagger, who had been investigating Garth's disappearance. Donna Garth confirmed Gyps' identity and, sensing some connection to her father, convinced Jagger to give her the Amulet. Donna's desire to locate her father unearthed the Zombie, but the Amulet was stolen from her by heroin addict Gene Griggs, who lost it just before being confronted and slain by the Zombie. After killing a pair of grave robbers, Garth sensed a connection to Haiti and stowed away on a ship bound for Port-au-Prince, coincidentally also boarded by Donna. Garth sought out old friend Anton Cartier, who hid him in a cave and offered a room to Donna. As she slept, Donna was abducted and brought to mad scientist Professor Richard Ricard, who had been trying to use a serum to create a human spider and found that Haitian women lacked the drug resistance to tolerate the potion, as they had not been exposed to chemicals and preservatives on a daily basis. Ricard injected Donna with his experimental spider-venom, transforming her into a giant spider-thing. Ricard was overjoyed and embraced the creature, which slew him and then escaped. Wandering off as soon as he had been left alone, Garth battled the giant spider-thing. In a passive-aggressive struggle mirroring their real life conflicts, the Zombie virtually ignored it as the creature attacked him savagely. Ultimately the spider-thing exhausted the serum and returned to normal, though the Zombie left before Donna revived. Later, the Zombie was drawn to a voodoo ceremony where dark voodoo priestess Katanya had condemned and mutilated Moira Mason for filming their ritual. When Moira's filmmaker husband Bruce agreed to become Katanya's zombie in exchange for restoring Moira, Garth intervened to prevent Bruce from sharing his fate. The Zombie slew Moira at her request, but Katanya's cultist then cast him into the ocean. Garth remained on the ocean floor until the Amulet was found by down-on-his-luck Phillip Bliss, who jokingly summoned the Zombie. Realizing his control, Bliss sent Garth to gain vengeance on the lawyers who had ruined Bliss's life. Bliss attempted to grant the Zombie a peaceful grave, but his Amulet was taken by agents of the criminal Mister Six. The Zombie followed the Amulet to Six's master, the legless Papa Shorty who held himself at normal height via levitation. Shorty forced the Zombie to kill Bliss, but then dropped the Amulet, and Garth vengefully slew Shorty. Shortly thereafter, the Amulet was found and sold by one of Shorty's former followers, and it -- and the legend of Simon Garth -- swiftly found its way into the hands of New York occult shop owner Gideon Starr, who used it in a plot with Myrna Lukaikas to kill her ailing husband, Frank. Gideon then had Myrna perform a ritual using a fake Amulet in which he posed as the Zombie, wearing the real Amulet and bursting through the ground, causing Frank to die of an expected heart attack. Unwilling to share her husband's fortune, Myrna poisoned Gideon, but the real Zombie, summoned by Gideon's Amulet, then arrived. As her Amulet was fake, Myrna could not stop the Zombie from killing her. Claiming the real Amulet, the Zombie tried and failed to will his own death, then wandered off. The Amulet was somehow returned to the ruins of Shorty's temple.Heading back to his bayou grave, Garth was drawn to a ritual conducted by Layla, who controlled him and promised him a final death. Becoming lost in the swamp, they encountered Eric Masterson, who threw Layla to his monstrous, cannibalistic son, Teddy. Garth confronted Eric and was futilely attacked by Teddy, and Layla slew Eric before leading Garth back into the swamp (note: This is not the same Eric Masterson who became Thunderstrike). Layla knocked herself out on a log while Garth wandered into the mystery of the deceased Brian Collier and his relatives, many of whom fell before a plot of Collier's lawyer, Jerome Ralston. Garth slew Ralston and his partner-in-crime, Collier's grandson, Jason. Layla's father, Papa Doc/Doc Kabel, gave her a gris-gris (magical charm) to end the Zombie's curse, but by then Garth had been called away by fireman Fred Miller, who had found the Amulet and summoned the Zombie as a party gag. Miller and his friends used Garth to torment their antagonists, but the Zombie was horrified after being forced to smash the head of a secretary, who turned out to be Layla. Dazed, Layla tore off Garth's Amulet, freeing him from their control, and he slew Miller and his friends. The dying Layla had Papa Doc use the last of her life force to return Garth to life for 24 hours to get his affairs in order - including killing Mister Six, attending Donna's wedding to Bruce Mason, and selling controlling interest in Garwood, using the money as a trust fund for Donna and Miranda - then allowed him to die in peace. The vampire Deacon Frost, working alongside Marie Laveau, once sought to usurp Garwood industries, which Donna eventually owned. Donna hired Hannibal King to track down the stolen Amulet of Damballah, as well as her father. King joined with Blade and Brother Voodoo to drive off Frost and Laveau, though Garth apparently remained buried.Caribbean priestess Calypso later slew Papa Doc, using his spirit to revive the Zombie, and he again existed at the whim of the Amulet's holder. Garth briefly battled the Daredevil doppelganger Hellspawn before freeing Papa Doc's spirit from Calypso, who transferred the Amulet (and her own spirit) to Daily Bugle secretary Glory Grant. Garth sought out Calypso for vengeance and assaulted Grant, leading to battles with Spider-Man and the mercenary Shotgun. Calypso's spirit eventually fled back into her own body and Glory gave the Amulet back to the Zombie. Garth later became a pawn of Dracula's daughter, Lilith, who used the Amulet to force him to gather fodder for her growing vampire army. Lilith was opposed by Spider-Man and Hannibal King, who tore the Amulet from Lilith and teamed with Garth to drive her off. King returned the Amulet and Garth to Donna, who brought him back to New Orleans to bury him. Donna later had the Zombie slay Papa Nebo and Narcisse after they had killed her old friend Angelina Beliard. Donna allegedly has some ties to the Legion of Night.He has been a Zombie for years the Midnight sons had been reborn.",
